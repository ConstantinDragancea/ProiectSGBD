5,I have bought several of the Vitality canned dog food products and have found them all to be of good quality. The product looks more like a stew than a processed meat and it smells better. My Labrador is finicky and she appreciates this product better than  most.
1,"Product arrived labeled as Jumbo Salted Peanuts...the peanuts were actually small sized unsalted. Not sure if this was an error or if the vendor intended to represent the product as ""Jumbo""."
2,If you are looking for the secret ingredient in Robitussin I believe I have found it.  I got this in addition to the Root Beer Extract I ordered (which was good) and made some cherry soda.  The flavor is very medicinal.
5,"Great taffy at a great price.  There was a wide assortment of yummy taffy.  Delivery was very quick.  If your a taffy lover, this is a deal."
5,This taffy is so good.  It is very soft and chewy.  The flavors are amazing.  I would definitely recommend you buying it.  Very satisfying!!
5,Right now I'm mostly just sprouting this so my cats can eat the grass. They love it. I rotate it around with Wheatgrass and Rye too
5,This is a very healthy dog food. Good for their digestion. Also good for small puppies. My dog eats her required amount at every feeding.
4,good flavor! these came securely packed... they were fresh and delicious! i love these Twizzlers!
5,The Strawberry Twizzlers are my guilty pleasure - yummy. Six pounds will be around for a while with my son and I.
5,My daughter loves twizzlers and this shipment of six pounds really hit the spot. It's exactly what you would expect...six packages of strawberry twizzlers.
2,I love eating them and they are good for watching TV and looking at movies! It is not too sweet. I like to transfer them to a zip lock baggie so they stay fresh so I can take my time eating them.
5,I am very satisfied with my Twizzler purchase.  I shared these with others and we have all enjoyed them.  I will definitely be ordering more.
5,Candy was delivered very fast and was purchased at a reasonable price.  I was home bound and unable to get to a store so this was perfect for me.
5,"My husband is a Twizzlers addict.  We've bought these many times from Amazon because we're government employees living overseas and can't get them in the country we are assigned to.  They've always been fresh and tasty, packed well and arrive in a timely manner."
5,I can remember buying this candy as a kid and the quality hasn't dropped in all these years. Still a superb product you won't be disappointed with.
5,I love this candy.  After weight watchers I had to cut back but still have a craving for it.
5,"I have lived out of the US for over 7 yrs now, and I so miss my Twizzlers!!  When I go back to visit or someone visits me, I always stock up.  All I can say is YUM!<br />Sell these in Mexico and you will have a faithful buyer, more often than I'm able to buy them right now."
5,"Product received is as advertised.<br /><br /><a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001GVISJM"">Twizzlers, Strawberry, 16-Ounce Bags (Pack of 6)</a>"
1,"The candy is just red , No flavor . Just  plan and chewy .  I would never buy them again"
4,I was so glad Amazon carried these batteries.  I have a hard time finding them elsewhere because they are such a unique size.  I need them for my garage door opener.<br />Great deal for the price.
5,"This offer is a great price and a great taste, thanks Amazon for selling this product.<br /><br />Staral"
5,"For those of us with celiac disease this product is a lifesaver and what could be better than getting it at almost half the price of the grocery or health food store!  I love McCann's instant oatmeal - all flavors!!!<br /><br />Thanks,<br />Abby"
5,"What else do you need to know? Oatmeal, instant (make it with a half cup of low-fat milk and add raisins;nuke for 90 seconds). More expensive than Kroger store brand oatmeal and maybe a little tastier or better texture or something. It's still just oatmeal. Mmm, convenient!"
5,I have McCann's Oatmeal every morning and by ordering it from Amazon I am able to save almost $3.00 per box.<br />It is a great product. Tastes great and very healthy
5,"McCann's Oatmeal is a good quality choice.  Our favorite is the Apples and Cinnamon, but we find that none of these are overly sugary.  For a good hot breakfast in 2 minutes, this is excellent."
5,We really like the McCann's steel cut oats but find we don't cook it up too often.<br />This tastes much better to me than the grocery store brands and is just as convenient.<br />Anything that keeps me eating oatmeal regularly is a good thing.
3,"This seems a little more wholesome than some of the supermarket brands, but it is somewhat mushy and doesn't have quite as much flavor either.  It didn't pass muster with my kids, so I probably won't buy it again."
5,Good oatmeal.  I like the apple cinnamon the best.  Though I wouldn't follow the directions on the package since it always comes out too soupy for my taste.  That could just be me since I like my oatmeal really thick to add some milk on top of.
3,"The flavors are good.  However, I do not see any differce between this and Oaker Oats brand - they are both mushy."
4,"I really like the Maple and Brown Sugar flavor. The regular is fine with brown sugar added. The Apples and Cinnamon flavor is OK. This is a very quick, easy and satisfying breakfast and I'll order this brand again, but not the variety. I'll get all Maple and Brown Sugar."
3,This is the same stuff you can buy at the big box stores.  There is nothing healthy about it.  It is just carbs and sugars.  Save your money and get something that at least has some taste.
1,"This oatmeal is not good. Its mushy, soft, I don't like it. Quaker Oats is the way to go."
3,we're used to spicy foods down here in south texas and these are not at all spicy.  doubt very much habanero is used at all.  could take it up a notch or two.
5,Deal was awesome!  Arrived before Halloween as indicated and was enough to satisfy trick or treaters.  I love the quality of this product and it was much less expensive than the local store's candy.
5,"It is chocolate, what can I say.  Great variety of everything our family loves.  With a family of six it goes fast here.  Perfect variety.  Kit Kat, Reeses, take five and more."
5,"Great product, nice combination of chocolates and perfect size!  The bags had plenty, and they were shipped promptly.  The kids in the neighborhood liked our candies!"
5,"Halloween is over but, I sent a bag to my daughters class for her share. The chocolate was fresh and enjoyed by many."
3,"Watch your prices with this.  While the assortment was good, and I did get this on a gold box purchase, the price for this was<br />$3-4 less at Target."
5,"This bag of candy online is pretty expensive, it should be cheaper in order to compete with grocery stores, other than that, its a good combination of my favorite candy"
1,Arrived in 6 days and were so stale i could not eat any of the 6 bags!!
5,This stuff really works for preventing cramping during the middle to latter stages of your rides. Pop 1 into each water bottle and you're set. Flavor is fine and goes down easy.
3,"If you're impulsive like me, then $6 is ok. Don't get me wrong, the quality of these babies is very good and I have no complaints. But in retrospect, the price is a little ridiculous (esp. when you add on the shipping)."
5,this was sooooo deliscious but too bad i ate em too fast and gained 2 pds! my fault
2,It is okay.  I would not go out of my way to buy it again
1,No tea flavor at all. Just whole brunch of artifial flavors. It is not returnable. I wasted 20+ bucks.
3,"The taste was great, but the berries had melted.  May order again in winter. If you order in cold weather you should enjoy flavor."
5,"i know i cannot make tea this good.  granted, i am not from the south but i know i have never enjoyed tea that was this sweet without being too sweet.  it tastes crisp."
5,This peppermint stick is delicious and fun to eat.  My dad got me one for Christmas because he remembered me having a similar one when I was a little girl.  I'm 30 now and I love it!
4,"Great gift for all ages! I purchased these giant canes before and the recipients loved them so much, they kept them and would not eat them."
5,"We have three dogs and all of them love this food!  We bought it specifically for one of our dogs who has food allergies and it works great for him, no more hot spots or tummy problems.<br />I LOVE that it ships right to our door with free shipping."
5,My shepherd/collie mix has IBS.  Our vet recommended a limited ingredient food.  This has really helped her symptoms and she likes it.  I will always buy it from Amazon...it's $10 cheaper and free shipping!
5,"Great food! I love the idea of one food for all ages & breeds. ├Ät's a real convenience as well as a really good product.  My 3 dogs eat less, have almost no gas, their poop is regular and a perfect consistency, what else can a mom ask for!!"
5,I have a standard poodle and pomeranian who both do wonderful on this food. I have switched them to a different food (due to price) a couple of times and end up going right back to natural balance.
5,"This is great dog food, my dog has severs allergies and this brand is the only one that we can feed him."
5,This food is great - all ages dogs.  I have a 3 year old and a puppy.  They are both so soft and hardly ever get sick.  The food is good especially when you have Amazon Prime shipping  :)
5,This is the same food we get at pet store. But it's delivered to my door! And for the same price or slightly less.
1,"I fed this to my Golden Retriever and he hated it.  He wouldn't eat it, and when he did, it gave him terrible diarrhea.  We will not be buying this again.  It's also super expensive."
5,"The mouth says, ""How do I love thee, let me count the ways...""<br />If you like apple products a must have item.  The only draw back, shipping cost.  These are very heavy."
4,"Arrived slightly thawed. My parents wouldn't accept it. However, the company was very helpful and issued a full refund."
4,"The crust on these tarts are perfect.  My husband loves these, but I'm not so crazy about them.  They are just too sour/tart for my taste.  I'll eat the crust and hubby takes my filling.  My kids think they're great, so maybe it's just me."
5,"These are absolutely scrumptuous!  My husband and I both love them, however, as another customer put it, they are expensive to ship!  The cost of shipping is more than the tartlets themselves are!"
5,What a nice alternative to an apple pie. Love the fact there was no slicing and dicing. Easy to prepare. I also loved the fact that you can make them fresh whenever needed.
5,I like Creme Brulee. I loved that these were so easy. Just sprinkle on the sugar that came with and broil. They look amazing and taste great. My guess thought I really went out of the way for them when really it took all of 5 minutes. I will be ordering more!
3,not what I was expecting in terms of the company's reputation for excellent home delivery products
5,"I love asparagus.  Up until very recently, I had never had pickled asparagus.  Oh my goodness, when a friend introduced me to this exact brand, I couldn't believe how great stuff tasted.  I loved it so much I bought the six pack.  I've got 2 jars left.  Gonna need more!!"
2,"I was diappointed in the flavor and texture of this mix.  I usually like most of the Low Carb things I have tried, but was diappointed in this specific one."
5,I have been drinking this tea for a long time now.  I used to have to purchase it at a doctor's office because it wasn't available elsewhere.  I'm so glad that I can buy it now from Amazon.com.  I drink this tea throughout the day like other folks drink coffee.  Wonderful taste.
5,"this has to be one of the best teas I have ever tasted... it's clean, bright, fresh...<br /><br />great delivery...again quality... just try it..."
5,"I love, love this green tea.  It is very hard to find in our area and some places on the internet charge a big price and I usually don't get as many boxes as I did with this merchant.  I will definitely order from this seller again!! Thanks!!  I depend on my green tea fix everyday!"
5,I love this tea. It helps curb my eating during the day. My Mom and I have given it all friends to try.
5,"I'm Italian and I lived in Italy for years. I used to buy these cookies for my everyday breakfast with an Italian espresso. I couldn't find them anywhere here in the Bay area, so it's great to have them again."
5,"One of my cats is allergic to fish and beef. This formula is one of the few she can eat, and it has much better ingredients than the prescription diets available at the vet. Both of my kitties are very active, have soft shiny fur, and neither are fat. Dry food reduces tartar buildup on teeth, also."
5,Our cats thrive extremely well on this dry cat food.  They definitely have much less hair ball throw ups and their fur is great.  They are fit and not over weight.  This vendor ships extremely fast.  Is one of the top Amazon suppliers in our book!
4,"I've been a fan of Hot & Spicy Maruchan Ramen for a long time. If you enjoy spice, and love ramen, you'll love this product. Too bad it's way too expensive here on Amazon. It's only $3.36 per 12 at my Walmart."
5,"I've been eating Ramen noodles since I was a little kid, and I've never found a better flavor than Hot & Spicy Chicken!  It isn't hot at all to a chilihead like me, but it sure is good!"
3,"I LOVE spicy ramen, but for whatever reasons this thing burns my stomach badly and the burning sensation doesn't go away for like 3 hours! Not sure if that is healthy or not .... and you can buy this at Walmart for $0.28, way cheaper than Amazon."
5,"Always being a fan of ramen as a quick and easy meal, finding it on amazon for a decent price and having it delivered to your door by the case is an amazing situation for anyone to find themselves in."
2,"I must be a bit of a wuss, because this soup tastes to me how I imagine fire might taste. Typically I like spicy food if it has a good flavor.  I don't find this to be the case with this soup. Any flavor is killed off by the burn."
5,I really loved the spicy flavor these had.  I found myself liking the broth more than the noodles which is usually the opposite.  If you aren't used to the heat this might bother you and if you like hot hot foods this might not be enough.
5,i have bought allot of different flavors and this happens to be one of my favorites and will be getting more soon
5,Delicious. I cannot get Australian ginger where I live. This compares favorably to Australian Ginger I've purchased in other cities. Now I can enjoy it without traveling.
5,"I keep trying other brands.... cheaper brands. Stupid me! This ginger IS soooo worth the money. Tender, moist and never a let down."
4,I bought this for our office to give people something sweet to snack on.  Because it's bite size it's easier for people to grab a couple a pieces rather than an entire licorice stick. My only complaint is that one of the bags broke open in shipping.
4,Twizzlers brand licorice is much better than that other well known brand.<br />If you can get these for $2 to $2.50 a package with free s/h it's a good deal.<br />The black and cherry have good taste; but the strawberry taste was too delicate and barely there
5,This is one of the best salsas that I have found in a long time but stay away from the variety pack. The other two that come with it are not worth your money.
3,These remind me of dog treats I made once using pumpkin and cinnamon. They're kind of bland and not my favorite Back To Nature product. But my finace really loves them so that's where the three stars come from.
5,"This is the best cornmeal. I made regular cornbread and hot water cornbread with this meal and both were outstanding. Also fried some oysters with this meal, it gave them a great texture and flovor."
5,"This is a fabulous marinade!  I love to use it for chicken, either baked in the oven OR on the grill.  This has enough flavor & flair, I've even used it for dinner parties, only to receive rave reviews from my guests!! DEFINITELY worth the price! Super cheap and super easy! Love it!"
5,Works with chicken fish beef or pork. Fast easy and makes it taste excellent. Plus buying in bulk is more than 50% off from box stores
4,Got this for my brother who is on Jorge Cruise diet and decided to try one for myself.  It actually tastes pretty good.
1,"These singles sell for $2.50 - $3.36 at the store for 1 box of 24 singles. I'm not sure why Amazon is selling it for $9.99 for a box of 24 singles.  Hazelnut coffee creamer is my favorite, but truly this is not a good buy."
5,What a deal this is the healthiest salt you can use.  This box should last our family the year no problem.  Iodized sea salt will not raise your blood pressure as regular salt will.
5,"Perfect size sea salt for the table or the picnic basket.  We love it. Shakes well, no clumping and flows freely."
5,I've never heard of the SAFCOL brand before but I was tired of only trying the typical pouches; Starkist and Chicken of the Sea. I was really surprised as I thought it was a bit better than the other brands and with less seasoning.
5,"these are the best tasting tuna pack they make in my opinion - make a great on the go snack, and really satisfying with the tomato"
3,"I have always purchased Star-Kist tuna but thought I would try this brand for a change of pace. The taste of the tuna was not pleasant, too much basil and other spices for me."
5,"I found it much tastier than the plain tuna pouches out there. Excellent quality, and no need to 'dress it up'.<br /><br />I put it the micro on about 20% power for 1 minute and Shazam!<br /><br />I believe a little heating brings out the flavor."
1,Seriously this product was as tasteless as they come. There are much better tasting products out there but at 100 calories its better than a special k bar or cookie snack pack. You just have to season it or combine it with something else to share the flavor.
5,"Used this in Moroccan recipes, as a syrup in a brilliant mixed beverage and as a swirled topping on sliced oranges soaked in orange water.  Wonderful, wonderful stuff!"
1,"Besides being smaller than runts, they look the same and have the same consistency.  Unfortunately, they taste nothing like banana runts...nor do they even taste good.  Yucky stuff.  Trying to return with vendor."
3,"The item over all was fine, but the Banana Heads are not just like Banana Runts they are alot smaller. Also when I received the item, the packaging was not great. The Banana Heads had come open during shipping and were all over the packing envelope."
5,"I purchased as a giveaway for a baby shower with Jungle theme! They worked out perfect for 25 small bags of candy. I purchased 5#. If you want more than 25 small bags, I would purchase a larger bag."
5,"I first had this drink when my mother brought it back with her from a visit to her home in Brittany France and thought it was delicious!  I wish it were a bit cheaper but other than that, I love this product!"
5,"One of the best lemon juice that I have tried. I am recurring customer due to the high quality of this product. When the season for fresh lemos is out, this one supplement our need for the citrus on the kitchen or refreshments.<br /><br />I will continue buying it."
5,This lemon juice is a must in my kitchen year-round. It has a powerful flavor and you don't need much of it to zest up a dish. I add a spritz of it to my water nearly every day.<br /><br />I will buy this product again and again.
5,"Fast delivery and good product. This is the same lemon juice concentrate you can find in stores and it's really handy to have around to add to sauces, dressings, etc. Such a pain to squeeze fresh juice everytime you need it, nevermind having the lemons on hand to begin with."
4,"This is not as good as the Frozen Lemon juice, but it is good. It has a slightly odd flavor, perhaps from a preservative. Sure wish I could order the frozen juice!"
4,I bought these at Grocery Outlet here in the Seattle Tacoma are for $4.00 a case of tweleve not paying $38.00 Yes 3 for a dollar. I like the taste not great but not bad either low calorie will buy more but not at this whacked out price.
5,"This is an great product. The taste is great, and it works exactly as described. Superb natural sleep aid. AMAZING!"
5,This  is great stuff.  Made some really tasty banana bread.  Good quality and lowest price in town.
5,"We had trouble finding this locally - delivery was fast, no more hunting up and down the flour aisle at our local grocery stores."
5,"My Scotties were full of hot spots and when I used this within a week all the hot spots were gone. The smell is kinda strong, but not bad. It's tolerablel."
5,"This coffee is great because it's all organic ingredients!  No pesticides to worry about, plus it tastes good, and you have the healing effects for ganoderma."
5,"Like the other people mentioned, this coffee has a great taste. I've tried different instant coffees before, but this one is one of the better ones. Another one of my favorites, if you want to try it out (though NOT organic), is 'Africafe pure instant coffee'"
4,"I like these better than the regular Altoids, but they're even more costly, so you'd better like them."
5,"Pros:<br />+packaging, shipping, price<br />+sold about a year before its expiration date (enough for me to eat/share 9 boxes)<br />+not too ""fresh"" like the regular wintergreen and not in a powdery form. it's a real mint!<br /><br />Cons: none!"
3,"Be careful not to eat too many of them in one day, as one of the chemicals in it is the same as that of a LAXATIVE!!! LOLOLOL!!!"
5,These mints are really strong and have a great taste. They are also a convenient size to carry in a pocket or purse.
5,This is a huge supply of them. I'm still working on these and have plenty to spare. Much more effective than buying one from the grocery store or 7-11 every time you want a mint.
5,"I love, and use the empty containers for medicine/advil in my purse, desk, suitcase. Also line with felt to keep earrings. Perfect little size to disguise small valuables when traveling and LOVE the mints. Tiny and powerful without burning my mouth."
5,Received as shown. My mother in law likes these and Walgreens quit carrying them. It was great i could get them on Amazon.
5,"The tiny Altoids are great for a quick breath freshening and the small box is great for portability. It's full, but compact.<br /><br />I haven't run out yet, and probably won't for a couple months, but I can't wait to buy it again."
5,Fresh scent and taste. Easy to eat one tin in few hours. I use them as favors and everyone loved them.
2,"Too much of a good thing? We worked this kibble in over time, slowly shifting the percentage of Felidae to national junk-food brand until the bowl was all natural. By this time, the cats couldn't keep it in or down. What a mess. We've moved on."
4,Don't buy just a few of these!  I order these by the case.  I can't even remember the first time I tasted an anchovy stuffed olive but I have tried several of the brands online and this brand is my favorite.
5,I order these olives a lot. They are un-like any other olives out there. The subtle flavors of the brine go great with cheeses. One of my favorite appetizer treats for guests.
1,"Hey, the description says 360 grams - that is roughly 13 ounces at under $4.00 per can. No way - that is the approximate price for a 100 gram can."
5,This is an excellent tea.  One of the best I have ever had.  It is especially great when you prepare it with a samovar.
2,Herbal additives in this blend destroy real tea taste. It is only for people who like herbal taste. I don't.
5,"I think I have tried just about every Bloody Mary mixer on the market at one time or the other.  Most have too much sugar or worst, corn syrup.  This mixer is all natural ingredients and very tasty. It does have a little kick. Enjoy."
5,"Might be a little spicy for some, but this stuff rocks. I use 1/2 and1/2 with V8 for a milder version , or the best is a Bloody Caesar!<br />Half mix ,half clamato!"
5,Took me one or two to get used to the pickle taste.  But now aim hooked and have to keep a bottle on hand
1,This candy is not as described. The middle is almost hard it is not a silky or smooth filling as described.<br />Looks and tastes like it's way past it's expiration date.<br />Would never reccommend this. Paid a good chunk of cash for nothing
5,"i cannot live without this citron falksalt, it is wonderful on watermelon, fish, almost any food requiring salt and in my world it all does.  just try it on red juicy watermelon, wonderful experience."
1,"Terrible! Artificial lemon taste, like Pledge Lemon Furniture Polish. Don't do this to yourself. Just use plain flake salt and some fresh grated lemon zest."
5,"These things are huge! I love the way the crystals crunch, and the flavor is not too overpowering or too subtle. This lemony flavor is my favorite--it's good on almost everything. You'll have plenty of flavored salt for a long time if you buy this."
5,"Fresh,a great way to get a little chocolate in my life without a million calories. They taste just like chocolate pudding."
5,"I've been enjoying this tea for years.  This tea is good mornings, afternoons or evenings.  My local store went out of buisiness....Thanks Amazon!  I use a bodum tea press to prepare a pot."
5,"Hi, I have to have black tea everyday. I have done it in the past 25 years and it's a habit of mine. Ahmad tea is one of my favorite brands and I highly recommend it if you like black tea. I think this is going to remain my favorite for the next 100 years or so :)"
4,I have tried it out despite the other review and I found that this is exactly the same tea i buy in either Russian or Italian groceries.
4,Ahmad Tea is an excellent looseleaf tea eith hot or for making iced tea. Great flavor with no lingering aftertaste.
5,good products and fast shipping equals a happy me. a little pricey but you can hand pick a few good flavors...a few i cant find anywhere else so def worth the price
5,If used on a daily basis you will keep your gums healty and between your teeth clean and free of plack.
3,The pork chops from Omaha Steaks were very tasty but at the same time exceptionally dry. Pork is usually dry meat but these were to the extreme. Possibly shipping them frozen and keeping them frozen was partly the problem.
1,"Five minutes in, one tentacle was bitten off, ball inside cracked in half. Not durable enough to be a dog toy. Disappointed :(. So is the dog :(."
1,"I felt energized within five minutes, but it lasted for about 45 minutes. I paid $3.99 for this drink. I could have just drunk a cup of coffee and saved my money."
5,"These Nature Valley Nut Lovers Variety Pack was perfect. Although I wasn't sure about the peanut butter bar, it was excellent. I loved the Roasted Almond, Roasted Pecan and the Peanut Butter.<br /><br />I will definately buy from this seller again. Quick shipping and very fresh."
5,"These are healthy and my mixed Llasa, Tibetan Terrier adores them. And they are healthy and his breath doesn't smell and his teeth are in good shape because of such products. A great healthy product."
5,"A great healthy chew for my 9 wk old beagle, Rio. He loves the taste and it sure beats my arm."
5,"I really enjoy this product. I had such a hard time finding it affordable in the store. Once I found it I look no further, it's the only sugar I use.  Thanks so much."
5,Love this sugar.  I also get muscavado sugar and they are both great to use in place of regular white sugar. Recommend!
5,Product is exactly as advertised.  What a savings!  At least half the retail price. Easy to store because of the individual packaging.
4,"It's just sugar in the raw, it's flavor profile is much better then white sugar and it's suppose to be better for you or something. I just wish the bags were resealable."
4,"I only use raw sugar, it did seem a little smaller than the normal crystals but it is still good. Will buy again."
5,I really love this sugar and price-wise it's much cheaper to buy it here on amazon compared to anywhere else.
5,"Love this sugar. It tastes so much better and isn't as overly sweet tasting as ""regular"" sugar. We've used it in quite a few baking items and they always turn out very good. The price that Amazon has this set at is very good to and makes it easy to use this for everyday stuff."
5,Great service! Items arrived faster than expected. Very efficient! Will use this seller again. I highly recommend this seller! Thank you for the excellent service!
5,Best flavor ever!  I'm addicted!  They are all good but these are by far the best.  I could live on these!  And there is no need for anymore to say....
5,"I found these crisps at our local WalMart & figured I would give them a try. They were so yummy I may never go back to regular chips, not that I was a big chip fan anyway. The only problem is I can eat the entire bag in one sitting. I give these crisps a big thumbs up!"
5,This is one of the best tasting crisps I have ever eaten! I only buy it on special occassions because I know I'll eat the whole bag.
5,the price on this product certainly raises my attention on compairing amazon price with the local stores. i can get a can of this rotel at my local kroger for $1. dissapointing!
5,I bought these for my husband and he said they are the best energy shots out there. He takes one in the mornings and works hard all day. Good stuff!
3,"I am a energy junkie and I'm not sure if this works or not, but what I do know is that the taste is not the greatest. I do drink the steaz energy drink and I think I get the same results. I like this products because it is  more natural then the others."
3,"I purchased it because it was on sale. In terms of the energy it provides, it works, but the taste leaves something to be desired. I tried mixing it with some water to make it more drinkable."
5,"If you're looking for an energy boost without artificial sweeteners and other chemicals, this is a great option.  The taste is decent and it is a nice smooth uplift without jitters."
5,"I have tried other energy shots and this one is the only one that really makes me feel good and energized without any other sides effects at all, its also the best taste, others taste like medicine, this one has a tea fresh taste. I love it."
5,I drive OTR...Over the Road truck and this helps to keep me alert. It has no sugar high & no crash. I'm on a autoship which i like. The price is very good. I've seen it over 2 bucks in the store.
5,"I use this product daily, and it provides a steady stream of energy.  I do not get jittery or crash.  It also helps me practice portion control because it acts as a slight appetite suppressant."
5,"You HAVE to try the VANILLA Tootsie Rolls!  The regular chocolate ones are good, but THESE are the BEST EVER!!"
1,"The package came with the label torn off and no cooking instructions. I know how I normally cook Couscous so tried 3/4 cup water to 1 cup couscous-brought to a boil and let sit, covered for 5min. It was mushy and tasteless.We have thrown out the rest of the container."
1,I wouldn't even think of buying this product unless I know the price per unit. How can I compare other items online or in a store?
5,"I love this coffee. I do wish it came already ground as I don't have a grinder and use a blender instead. But it's worth it. Many flavored coffees I've tried only seem to have a flavored odor that doesn't reach the coffee, but this one manages both."
5,"It is hot! I love it, tasty and a little sweet. I usually scoff at salsas labeled as hot, but this one lives up to its billing."
5,"service was great, but I meant to buy Swiss Chalet chicken SAUCE not the Marinade :)<br /><br />Love the sauce - have yet to try the marinade"
5,"Use frequently as we like to do Asian dishes at least once a week.  Love this product.  Fast shipping, as usual.  Would buy again."
5,"These individually wrapped pieces are delicious (although I wish there were a few more). Mildly sweet with no sugar-free aftertaste, even a traditional ""marzipan-aholic"" should enjoy these."
5,Put this in my husbands stocking for Christmas and it was a hit.
3,"I was amazed at how quickly it arrived!  It is a cute stocking stuffer, but only OK as far as user appeal.  You get what you pay for."
3,Toy was typical quality I expected.  I got taken for a major ride on the shipping!
1,So we cancelled the order.  It was cancelled without any problem.  That is a positive note...
5,i love the convenience of the singles. The best creamer around.Taste is just like the big bottle. I can stick them in my purse and take them to work.
4,"Even though we are International Delight fans we were not completely dissapointed by this product. We had no problem with the shipment, but the creamer itself is thinner than International Delight. Other than that we are happy :D"
5,"This seller is very nice.  And the price is very good.  The only reason I stop ording is bacause I went to sugar free, and at that time he did not have it.  But for those of you that don't have to watch there fat in take, I would get this product from them."
5,"I purchased these coffee mate singles to use at work along with the coffee ""tea"" bags.  They're great because they don't require refrigeration."
1,"I received the items in a timely manner. Upon receipt, I removed a pack to consume. The pop-tart was STALE and left an awful taste in my mouth."
1,"Taste like it is stale.  Will not order this again.  I had this coffee at a 50th year annerversery at a reception hall and had to have it.  This stuff tasted NOTHING, like the Douwe Egberts at the hall.  This is possibly stale coffee."
1,"Serveice delivery with the seller was excellent. The product was not. Will not order again. Bad taste. Iam not sure if it was old or that how it tastes. I throw it right away, i coudl not drink it."
5,"This is honestly THE BEST seasoning salt in all the land.  It tightens up any dish; not spicy, just perfectly seasoned.  It's perfect, hence, my purchase of this 35 oz. mamma jamma."
5,"The order arrived as advertised. I have had only a few chances to use it, but it is awesome. The flavor is exactly what I hoped for! It may take me a while to finish the entire gallon, but I will definnantly order again!"
5,"I like a lot of sesame oil and use it in salads regularly.  Great quality, flavor and aroma.  Can't beat that its organic!"
5,"What a GREAT idea!!!! My daughter love it.<br />I don't think is difficult to wash, I mean, is not like just toss water and that's it... but, come on!!!!<br />Absolutely recommend it!"
3,This product is impossible to wash and actually get cleaned.  I couldn't get the food pieces out to save my life. I tried scrubbing them out and even washed it in the dishwasher as it suggests.
5,"I loved this product for fruits and other food that I didn't want my new baby to choke on.  I also used it to put ice in when my baby was teething. It worked great for this, as well as for the food. I didn't like bananas in it though-impossible to get clean!"
3,"The Munchkin fresh food feeder is an okay product, it's kind of like sucking on food through a cloth. While my daughter was interested in it for a little while, she eventually lost interest. I may introduce it back to her again and see how she reacts."
4,"This product is amazing. I know a few people with little ones that use these and they LOVE them!! Super easy to clean and use. When ordering these, I was under the impression that there were 2 per package...FYI-they're not!! Only one per..."
5,"""These are delicious! The chocolate is excellent and the espresso bean was the perfect roast for this purpose. Crunchy and not bitter.""<a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00067AD4U"">Chocolate Covered Espresso Beans 5 Pounds</a>"
5,"The product was exactly as advertised and fresh.  Unfortunately, I keep them in a candy dish in the office and they are going fast.  We need to reorder to keep up with ""demand"""
5,"These chocolate covered espresso beans are wonderful!  The chocolate is very dark and rich and the ""bean"" inside is a very delightful blend of flavors with just enough caffine to really give it a zing."
5,"Popchips are so good.  I have been following Weight Watchers and lost 50 pounds and am at my goal.  These Popchips are my salty crunchy indulgence.  They taste so  good,"
5,"The Sugar was sweet, that can not be denied.  As advertised, It didn't melt when baked either.  However, it will not do for your Liege Waffles/Gaufres what the larger pebbles of Belgian pearl will do.  These grains are smaller, think pretzel salt, or seed pearls."
5,"That's exactly what I was looking for to bake some chouquettes (puffs with small sugar pearls on top). Works great, yum!!"
5,This is what I was looking for and was missing it. The taste is exactly the taste as the one made in India so just loved it and remember my days back in India. Definitely recommend it.
4,"Great stuff and dependable, especially when there are a million brands ""out there"" to choose from.  I love the stuff.  For really high end desires, I go with the Apollo Olive Oils from California.  But I buy a whole lot more of this stuff and will buy it again and again."
5,"Having always been a strict Peet's Coffee lover, I was reticent to switch brands but Weaver's won my heart!! The taste is clean and strong, the ethos is correct (organic, baby) and even the packaging is very zen and appropriate. Be still my caffeinated heart!"
1,"A very bitter tasting coffee even when enhanced with cream and/or honey. Definately not my cup of coffee. Oh, did i say it was bitter?"
5,"I like eating these whenever I need an energy boost.<br />It has everything that I am searching for in a, ""To Go Snack"".<br />Fiber plus Chocolate is never a bad thing!!!"
5,These are my favorite bars ever. The combo of raisons and dark choc is wonderful! Very filling! These are hard to find in the stores. I'm thankful for subsrcibe and save!
5,"My fiance loves these dark chocolate and nut granola bars and all the grocery stores around us don't carry them anymore!  Once again, Amazon came through and he couldn't be happier."
5,"I was buying Quaker Oats granola bars but these Nature Valley chewy bars are better tasting, they make a great snack when I'm on the go. Chocolate, peanuts and raisins...it doesn't get any better."
4,"""Nantucket Blend coffee is one of my favorites.  I was suprised that it was a single box.  every time I ordered before it was a 2 pack.  My fault for not reading closer.  I will not order any more at this price for 1 (24 count)"
5,Green Mountain is my favorite brand. Nantucket is my favorite coffee from Green Mountain. Very smooth flavor. Not too strong and not too weak.
4,"I was looking for a replacement for Timothy's Kona Blend which is no longer carried on Amazon.  This coffee from Green Mountain is very nice, but not strong enough for me.  If you like milder coffees, then this one is for you."
5,"One of Green Mountains best blends of coffee in my opinion,love it for your everyday blend, perfect stregnth, excellent blend!"
5,"This is just Fantastic Chicken Noodle soup, the best I have ever eaten, with large hearty chunks of chicken,and vegetables and nice large noodles. This soup is just so full bodied, and is seasoned just right.  I am so glad Amazon carries this product.  I just can't find it here in Vermont."
5,"I have used this oil for several years and it is the best for eating with bread or cooking,  I love the regular, I use it on everything. You won't be sorry you tired it, great for dipping bread and cooking omelet, and green beans."
5,"Oh my gosh, is this good!  Like most people, I've been eating ketchup my whole life and never really thought anything about it.  Then Hubby brought a jar of this home.  The tomato flavor is amazing.  I will never buy store ketchup every again."
5,"This is ridiculous.  The best gourmet ketchup I have ever tasted.  It is pricey, but wow..love this stuff.  It would make a great gift for someone who is hard to buy for but loves their ketchup.  Yummy!"
5,The tomatoes are the star of the classic flavor.  It is clean and really fresh!  Perfect on an avocado chicken sandwich.<br /><br />The spicy flavor is more complex and is the best ketchup I have ever tried.  It is so good I have now used it on foods that would make me seem crazy!
3,"The spicy version of this ketchup isn't bad, but it is too expensive.  The regular version is sweet as dessert.  Horrible.  Annie's Organic has a much better flavor and costs a lot less.  Even Heinz organic is a better deal.  I gave it three stars instead of two because it is in glass, not plastic."
1,These condiments are overpriced and terrible. The classic is disgustingly sweet. The spiced tastes like a bad spicy marinara sauce from a chain restaurant.
5,"I have been using porcini mushrooms in my cooking for twenty plus years. The Roland extra fancy porcinis that I purchased from you are the best that I have ever used, including the mushrooms that I bought in Italy and transported back to the USA."
5,"If you are a peanut lover, these are for you. Much larger than cocktail peanuts. Six people on my Christmas gift list ask for these every year!!"
5,These nuts arrived fresh and are very tasty.  They are not broken or dirty looking like cashews sometimes can.
2,"My cat will go for a day, probably longer, haven't tryed it, but he'll walk right by this stuff every time, even when I know he's hungery. ABSOLUTELY NO INTEREST. I swear he'd rather die of starvation then even take a wiff of it!!"
5,Got this free with another order I placed.  I couldn't believe how much the cats loved it. I will buy again for sure.
5,This is a great ham soup base.  I have used it in Ham and beans and seasoned greenbeans.  Great flavor
1,I haven't used the ham base. It is loaded with MSG. I did not realize this when I ordered it and can not return it because it is a food item
5,Before I discover this mix on Amazon I always bought it in Whole Food Store.<br />I like this mix and when I am doing the pancakes they came very delicious and fluffy.<br />Just one small secret: Try to add the Seltzer water instead of regular one.
5,I appreciate the fact that I can buy this product online and have free shipping. This is a great all around mix that is very good with a wonderful texture. Thanks again amazon.
5,"Arrowhead Mills Buttermilk Pancake mix is my favorite mix.  It tastes great, cooks up light and fluffy and is super easy to make.  Although it can be made using water, I think it's better made with milk.  I love it with pure organic maple syrup."
5,The pancakes taste great without any recipe adjustments for my son's egg allergy.  It's also great for camping or any time you'd like to be able to make pancakes without having fresh eggs available.
4,We are glad we found this mix as we make pancakes without eggs for my son who has an allergy.<br />They taste fine for our family- we like them many ways!
3,I love the flour however Amazon sent it with a book which broke a bag and made a mess. Customer sevice took care of the problem however it was a foolish way to ship the product.
1,This mix is very poorly packaged and breaks open easily during shipping. Nearly a full bag of my order was spilled in the shipping box. 3 bags out of 4 had come unsealed at the top. There were no tears in the packages.
1,"Just awful!  I thought food was supposed to taste good!  I had to eat ice cream afterwards to get the taste out of my mouth, it's that bad."
5,A good tasting light chip that has some value in nutrition.  Everyone get the munchies....is this is a good alternative to eating potato chips!
5,"A grande item !  Delicious fish with the ultimate flavor, best  ever in a can for all purposes !  I sent a case to my Mother recently diagnosed with Diabetes, and she loves it as a main entree for cooking patties !"
5,"i love this product cant find it locally. Sometimes little out of the way stores have it.But i also love the chicken,pork chop bags.Every store i go in i look for them the lastplace i found it was at a meat market."
5,This is the best way to cook a roast.  Our local grocery went out of buisness and so I could not find this product till I looked here.  Please continue to keep this product available!
5,It's always a pleasure to find French's products on the web.  All of the markets in my area have made a bargain to carry nothing but McCormacks bland and tasteless seasonings.<br /><br />This is the most flavorful cooking bag mix you will ever find.
5,"If you like Oreo's or the Oreo cakester, then you've got to try the Double Stuff cakesters!!! These are the best!! Side note: shipping was very slow, but maybe your chances will be better."
5,"I was surprised about how good this was my family and friends laughed when I told them I bought this. But out of the can ready mix with a little salt, pepper, spinach, and some cheese and it's a great easy meal!"
5,Whats there to say about a fantastic chocolate chip cookie! The only thing that could be improved is if they offered a bushel box of these so you would not run out so fast. Hope these don't go the way of the dinosaur!
4,These arrived on time and packaged in green plastic wrap.  The cookies were as fresh as the boxes found in the local grocery store.<br /><br />I have no complaints but I also now have no more cookies. We ate them all!
5,"They aren't fattening and they're good for you, right? That's what I heard, at least, from an admittedly unreliable person."
4,"Great if you are cutting back on fat, they do resemble regular chips but are nothing like them. Extremely dry and hard."
5,"I have never met a Kettle brand chip I did not like. These chips have a great loaded potato flavor, which are flavorful. I like the sweet onion chips better, but these are also at the top of the list for great-tasting potato chips. Kettle chips are great chips f/the money!"
4,"I buy mostly for vending, so the size of the bag is important. Kettle's 1 oz bag is a good size although it seems a bit less than full. Salt & Vinegar flavor is satisfying, about an 8 out of 10."
4,Glad to find these in a one ounce size but the bag seems a bit less than full. It's hard to find single serving chip bags that vend well. Sometimes they are too wide. or too plump with air. Bag size is good. BBQ flavor is about an 8 out of 10.
5,"one of the best chips that you can buy...and i've tried all the kettle varieties, and many others.  There's only a slight taste of jalapeno, and they are delicious. Perfect with a sandwich or alone.<br />If you like being addicted, these are the chip for you. ...See you at addicts anonymous..."
5,These chips are thick and crunchy.  I absolutely love them.  The taste is perfect.  I like to buy these smaller bags because I cant trust myself with a large bag of these because they taste no good.
5,"I love these chips, I buy the 24 pack once a month. The bags are just the right size for snacking and prevent me from eating way too much with the larger bags. The jalapeno spice is subtle enough not to be overpowering but still gives you a great amount of flavor."
5,"I have been ordering the sea salt chips for about a year.I love them,but my daughter picked some of these up at our local grocery store and now they are my new favorite.Will be ordering them."
5,These are my favorite gluten-free dairy-free flavored chips.  Many other salt and vinegar chips contain dairy so it's nice to find ones that I can eat.  The vinegar flavor is really intense and good.
4,Salt and vinegar chips are definitely my favorite type of any potato chip. These ones made by Kettle were very tasty and I enjoyed them thoroughly. I just wish there was a more healthy option with the same great taste.
5,"These are so tangy it prevents me from eating too many, a handful or two does the trick. Very crisp and savory."
3,"I usually love Kettle Chips, and love salt & vinegar, but these chips were way too vinegary for me! They do have the typical kettle chip crunch, but are too aggressively flavored for my taste."
5,Tried many varieties of BBQ chips and hands down these are the BEST on the market! These R not too salty or greasy. Great crispy crunch. Plenty of good BBQ flavor with a hint of sweetness that all other brands fall short of. Every bag (after bag) is just as mouth wateringly delicious as the 1st!!
5,"Kettle chis are the best ever! These used to be my favorite flavor until I tried their Salt and Pepper kind but I'm sure this is just a personal preference.<br /><br />Crunchy, real potato chips!"
5,"These chips have the right amount of crunch and I enjoy the taste. Chips are consistent and have a fairly even distribution of seasoning. I like the 2-oz size bags, just the right amount of chips."
5,"This was the best deal ever. The delivery was fast, the chips are delicious and very fresh.  Love it:)"
5,My husband and I LOVE these chips! Personally I think the flavor is perfect. Try them for yourself!
5,"As a professional potato chip muncher, I see these as thee very BEST on the market. Rich taste and flavor!! Almost impossible not to finish the entire bag.The true meaning of decadence!"
5,"These are hands-down the absolute best Salt & Vinegar chips you can buy.  They have a great, strong flavor that has left me addicted.  These are certainly my favorite chips.  I highly recommend trying them!"
5,"Oh, I love these chips! And they're so hard to find where I am, and when I do find them, they're usually $1-2 more per bag for less. Great that these are so cheap here at Amazon."
4,"these chips are good, and bad, and create moral dilemmas constantly. If wou are strong at will, or having a large BBQ go for it, but as for me, i was in the habit of bringing a new bag to work every three days, had to put in a lot of time on the treadmill to make up for it. BEWARE"
5,"I have to admit that those chips are so good that they are highly addictive. I can't stop eating them!!! It's crunchy and seasoned at the right amount of flavor and salt. Just perfect!!! Believe me, some chips are so salty, I can't finish a small bag. But this one... I just keep on eating!"
5,These chips remind me of a long obsolete brand of chips we could get in middle school. They are by far the tastiest chips I've had and it's impossible to walk past the aisle without picking up the trademark blue bag and then putting the bag clip on the bag!
5,"These are by far my favorite chips, they are extremely crunchy (similar to other Kettle style chips), but it's the extreme Vinegar flavor that differentiates these from lesser fried potato snacks.  I've tried several other brands of Salt and Vinegar and none of them come close."
4,It took a while to get used to these chips but they are pretty good and more healthy for you. They sure were eaten all up by my family and friends.
4,"These are delicious.  The 2 oz bags are a bit big for school lunches, definitely more than a serving."
5,"We are always pleased with Amazon's packaging. Chips are never crushed or broken, always fresh. We really liked this brand/flavor of chips. Very tasty!"
5,"These chips were a great deal.  Kettle was having a special deal for the case of chips.  They are hard to find in Vegas and are my favorite flavor. Shipping was very fast, sooner than expected."
5,fantastic!you can not beat this taste and you can not resist to it only one if you are spice lover
4,Eat at your own risk.  Once I would open a bag I could not stop.  Good and salty.
5,"I don't eat many chips, but these I love. Great buy and arrived quick and packed great. Expiration date is a ways away, so I have awhile to enjoy them Great natural potato flavor. I love brown russet, hardy flavor and these fit that description to a tee."
5,Bought this box of chips as a Father's Day gift because Dad loves them.  They are very yummy and more substantial than regular chips.
5,"These chips are quite tasty and the price is right.  Packaged very well, would buy again."
2,I like Kettle chips but was really disappointed with this order because they were over cooked.  I bought a bigger sized bag from Costco and the chips were all cooked perfectly. So I don't know why these were different.<br />Will never buy these chips from here again.
5,For some reason Amazon would not ship these to Alaska!..so I sent them to my grandchildren who got to enjoy them.  They are very good chips! Amazon should rethink the shipping to Alaska thing.  I would order groceries online.
4,"Just got this order and it is ok. A bit light on the cheddar flavoring and herb taste eludes me, if it is there."
2,"I really love Kettle brand chips, but these are rather disappointing. There is very little sour cream or onion flavor."
5,We love Kettle Chips Lightly Salted and don't feel guilty eating them!  We used to buy them at Whole Foods but buying from Amazon has saved us money.  We have purchased at least 3 times and have been happy with the chips and the delivery.
5,"But if you happen to, like me, there is no better sea salt and vinegar chip I've found in this country."
5,"i rarely eat chips but i saw these and tried them. they are really amazing. i love cheddar too, but the chips are really thin and crunch and delicious flavor. i recommend them."
4,"Okay, I should not eat potato chips, nor should anyone.<br />But these are so spicy, I would find it hard to eat<br />very many. That makes them an indulgence that<br />rescues some people from overindulgence."
5,"I bought these for the office and no one can put them down. I'm ordering more today and it has only been 2 weeks. Didn't have to shop for them either, Amazon brought it to my door!"
2,It was a great value and I like the package size but not vinegary enough for me. Won't order this brand again. Great chips otherwise.
5,Perfect!! They are my favorite because I can season with a variety of spices to exactly suit my tastes without all the salt!
5,These are the best unsalted chips around and we have tried many.  They have the best potato flavor.  They came when you said they would.
1,"Kettle chips now look, feel and taste like Lays.  These chips used to be my favorite when it was crinkle cut and hefty.  Now, no longer my favorite."
5,Great price for an excellent chip. At about 80 cents for a 2 ounce bag these are a bargain as well as a very tasty chip. Everyone I've let try these has been impressed and commented on how good they taste. I've yet to find a Kettle chip that disappointed!
3,This is the first time I tried Sea Salt & Vinegar chips. Not my taste.  Make sure you like salt & vinegar before ordering. You may be in for a suprise if you have never tried them before.  I'll stick with the salt and black pepper chips.
5,"Despite coming in an extremely large box, I found this to be great value. All the bags were preserved with a reasonable expiration date that is months away. I'd definitely recommend."
4,"If you like spicy, then these are for you.  I like spicy, so I enjoyed these.  They're also crunchy, as kettle-cooked chips should be."
3,"These are decent, but if you want a realllly good salt and vinegar chip, try Boulder's Salt and Malt Vinegar chips.  THOSE are awesome."
2,"Being a salt-free product is why I purchased this, but the chips are quite greasy."
3,"These things are just too darn cheesy. If you like a lot of flavor, you'll love these. Otherwise, you will overdose on their cheddary goodness."
5,"These potato chips are excellent.There are no trans fats.<br /><br />They taste absolutely delicious.Whenever I am in the mood for potatoe chips, Kettles is the brand I buy.<br /><br />A great product that anyone should enjoy and I highly recommend them!<br /><br />Enjoy!"
5,I have tried a lot of S&V chips and these are the best!  Real sea salt and REAL vinegar!  Mouth-watering flavor & crispiness.  Not for the faint of heart - the flavor is very authentic!  :)
4,"Chips are not as tangy as I hoped or expected. Poore Brothers is a better choice for the ""hard-core"" Salt N Vinegar fans."
3,These bags had a lot of overcooked brown pieces. also felt very greasy. Had to keep wiping my fingers on a napkin.
3,"The first time I tried these, I thought, ""WOW!"" but I quickly found they were just too darn spicy and tart... Hard to enjoy the potato-chippiness of them when your mouth is under seige."
5,"Chilling in the fridge seems to boost the flavor even more; and using them, rather than corn chips, to make nachos will have your tastebuds singing like Janet Jackson. (But without any of the associated wardrobe risks. (-:) HIGHLY recommended."
1,"When originally produced in England  these we're the best chips I had ever tasted but unfortunately since they were bought out by the US conglomerate they now taste plain nasty. Hard rather than crispy, are much thinner than they used  to be and lacking any  flavour , a real shame."
1,after opening numerous bags I found that none of the chips had any flavoring on them. completely plain and gross. how does this even happen?
3,"These chips are okay.  Personally, I find the flavor combination on a greasy chip to be somewhat strange.  They're not necessarily bad but they're the kind of chip where you're only going to be able to have three of four chips before the flavor loses its novelty."
1,"These chips are nasty.  I thought someone had spilled a drink in the bag, no the chips were just soaked with grease.  Nasty!!"
4,They are good but wish they were also baked. Have not found baked no salt potato chips anywhere. If there are any I wish someone would post.
3,These are better in England. I don't know why. Maybe it's just nostalgia on my part.
1,I ORDERED KETTLE CHIPS IN THE FOLLOWING FLAVVORS<br />SALT & FRESH GROUND PEPPER<br />TUSCAN 3 CHEESE<br />N.Y. CHEDDAR AND HERS<br /><br />THEY ALL TASTED THE SAME TO ME.  IF THERE IS A VARIETY PACK SUGGEST U ORDER BEFORE ORDERING LARGE SIZE.<br /><br />I WISH I COULD RETURN THE UNOPENED BAGS.
1,"These chips are greasy and taste burnt-there is grease in the bottom of the bag and the chips are saturated with it (especially at the bottom of the bag. Even if they are trans fat free, they need to be a lot less greasy."
1,"Don't waste your money on any of the Kettle brand potato chips.  I bought a case of these, and a case of the cheddar and sour cream.  Both cases ended up in the garbage can."
1,"DEfintely not as tasty as the Madhouse Munchies which are my family's favorite. Kettle's are dark/burnt,more broken bits, taste greasy-oily and not the light crunch. Oh well."
1,"I love sour food but this one I can't bear.  Too strong sour taste... and even when you open the bag, the sour smell is too strong.  I don't like it."
1,"Unless you really really really like vinegar - AVOID! Those chips should have been called ""Vinegar and Sea Salt"" - not ""Sea Salt and Vinegar""."
5,"My daughter that has autism craves hot, spice and pungent foods.  These are her absolute favorite chips!  She calls them her sour chips and wants them in her lunch all the time.  I love the crispy kettle way they're cooked."
5,I am glad I was able to find these on this site. I love this flavor and they are so crunchy. The box is packed inside another box but still some bags end up as crumbs. Most of the bags survived in tact.
5,"These chips taste awesome. And unlike most other flavored chips, they actually make sure that plenty of the flavory salty goodness gets on each individual chip. Just don't pass gas near any pretty ladies after consumption. They'll totally know it was you."
5,I have never been addicted to anything in my life...until I tasted these chips.  I have tried other brands of the sea salt and vinegar flavor and they are just not the same.  You've got to stick with this blue bag of chips!
5,I bought these when on sale through Amazon.  Nice crispy thick chips.  Definitely a great buy if you can catch them on sale.
5,This is a real good product.I love these chips and so does my customers can't go wrong wit these the best
5,I love these chips and now the whole family is hooked on them. These are the only chips I eat
4,I don't know what to say that others have not covered. If you like potato chips you will like these. Get em on sale when you can and limit your intake...if you can...
5,If you're looking at this you probably already know you like these chips.<br />This is a great deal and I have not had any problems with them going stale.<br />The 1oz bags are a great size for a snack and help avoid over-eating.
1,"While I admit that the oversalted chip is addictive, I really think this one has gone too far. Skin literally peeled off my lips and inside my mouth after eating these. I am surprised that they are still on the market."
5,"Only 5mg sodium per serving, chips are crisp.  I sometimes will dip in a low salt ketchup and that adds a bit to the flavor."
5,"I have found this product, Kettle Chips Unsalted to be fabulous.  I found them by accident on Amazon after hunting all over my local stores.  They are crisp and tasty without all of the salt."
5,If you love jalapeno chips then Kettle is a must try.<br />Nice and cruncy with the kick of jalapeno.<br />Delicious.<br />Addicting.<br />Recommended.
5,"How to achieve potato chip nirvana? It's simple:  Buy these chips, get them tomorrow, eat them!<br />Repeat.<br /><br />Why?<br /><br />Best ""old school"" BBQ flavor out there<br />Kettle quality<br />Incredible price with Amazon<br /><br />Did I mention delicious and a terrific bargain?"
5,"I found these more than 10 years ago in a health food store. After I bought one bag I found myself stopping by that store once a week to get these chips. The New York Cheddar flavor is so good, you will have a hard time not eating a whole bag."
5,But you will enjoy ever step. I gained 5 lbs within a month of buying this 12 pack of full sized bags. Damn it! They should warn you about this! Tastes awesome though. When I finish my crash diet I will order another box (case?). :-)
5,"Kettle chips are thicker and crunchier (though greasier at times) than other chips, and the honey dijon flavor is great.  They don't have the overwhelming salty taste some cheaper chips have, and the 2oz size is great for an adult size snack."
5,"Tasted good. Spicy. Those that don't like spicy should stay away from this. For the price paid, very good buy."
5,These really are amazing chips. Don't be put off by one of the cheeses being blue cheese...it is so subtle that even blue cheese haters (like me)will enjoy these.
5,These chips were good. I ended up eating a whole bag a day for a while cause they were so good. I am glad that they do not have any dextrose in them like lays do.
5,these are the best chips out there.. nothing can beat this taste. if you like honey mustard then you will definitely like this.. once you eat it you wont stop..addicting stuff
3,I dont know if they were fresh or if they were supposed to taste like they did. I checked the expiration date it was current but still tasted kind of stale to me !!!
5,"At first I was thinking, ""cheese flavored chips?""  But I love them.  The herbs they used are just delicious.  The cheese is not overpowering.  They are yummy and crispy!!"
5,"I try to be good, but when I feel like indulging in some delicious, gourmet potato chips, these New York Chedder potato chips are the first flavor I like to go for, when I see them at the natural food store.  The chips are tangy and crunchy and satisfy your potato chip fix like no other brand."
5,"Kettle lightly slated chips are my favorite on the market. I don't care for the ""fancy"" flavors and these are salted just right. Thick, super crunchy and full of flavor, they are the best!"
3,"These chips are tasty but not what I expected from a ""low salt"" item.  They seem as salty as any ""regular"" potato chip, and they also seem excessively greasy.  By comparison, Cape Cod Reduced Fat chips are less salty with at least as much potato flavor and far less greasy."
5,My 8 yo is a Kettle chip addict so I was so happy to find snack size bags for his lunch!!! Great quality and much cheaper than in the stores!!! Will definitely be buying more!
3,Miss Vickies are better but unfortunately less widely available.  I'm not sure tough is the right word but there is a noticeable difference between the two brands and Miss Vickie's are better IMHO.
4,"This kettle chips taste ""Good , Crispy & Crunchy "" too ! U will enjoy it also! Moreover,it's thinly cut & sliced!"
5,"I bought this tea as an alternative to very pricey Teavana Black Teas. I have a cup every morning, very smooth refreshing tea."
5,"These biscuits are delicious, not too sweet, with just enough crunch.  We love them.  Quick delivery. We would order them again.  Very satisfied."
5,"Excellent, lo-fat, lo- calorie treat for dogs. I have a German Shorthair Pointer-and these treats are her favorite( the organic peanut butter cookies are for smaller dogs, but she loves them-and for weight-control I like them!)"
5,This product does a great job of clearing out the kidneys.  It has helped make my husband feel lots better even though he is in early renal failure.
5,"Love this with a bag of shrimp 3/4 pound, some stir fry veges and a little onion chopped. Not too hot but very tasty."
5,"We make up a coffee creamer with 1/4 part commercial coffee creamer, vanilla, butter creme, almond and Bavarian Creme flavors and the rest milk.  It tastes wonderful and is half the price of store-bought!<br /><br />It is excellent!"
4,"Good quality nectar.  Very tasty.<br /><br />However, I was expecting 46 fluid ounces, not 46 ounces in weight.<br /><br />I find that 46 ounces in weight makes about 32 fluid ounces."
5,First time I've ever used Agave Nectar -- and it is great.  Keeps the blood sugar stable.  Great buy also!
5,"This sweetner is the best, it brings out the true flavors in what ever you add it to. And it has great health benefts."
5,I love this stuff.  It sweetens without affecting the blood glucose levels.  Now if I could only figure out how to make tequila I would be set.  Just kidding.
5,"I finally have found a natural sugar substitute that has the added benefit of having a low glycemic index. Agave is delicious! I have recommended it to many friends, and it is very economical to purchase the 46oz bottles."
5,"I love using this to sweeten tea, coffee, etc. It tastes much better than other low glycemic sweeteners - there is no bitter aftertaste."
5,"I ordered this product two times now and have been very happy with both the delivery and the product.  It works great for cooking, baking and as a substitute sugar in my Chai lattes."
5,"I really like this product and taste great with the coffee or tea, and I have lost weight by cutting the sugar and replacing it with the honey and Agave nectar."
5,"I love this product! It is the best natural sweetener I have ever tried, and I have tried many. You can use also as pancake syrup or as a substitute for honey on your peanut butter and honey sandwich. It last a long time, and is a good value."
5,"I have been using Agave Nectar for several months now and have found it to be a staple in my home. Madhava Agave Nectar is good tasting, it was a good buy!"
5,"This stuff is great because it's low glycemic. Substitute this to sugar and you'll be doing your body a great favor.  This size is economical and shipping is fast, too.  I got mine very soon."
5,"Save a little money buying in larger quantities, as opposed to the smaller bottles. I like the taste of Agave, cross between honey/maple. Good for pies, cereal, frozen yogurt, etc."
5,"This is an awesome product which I've ordered many times.  Honey-like flavored, lower glycemic sweetener that's great in coffee or tea."
5,thank you for this product - we use it all the time and appreciate your promptness and the price was excellent.  Thanks again.
1,I am very disappointed with this product because I could not see how many calories it has at the time I ordered it. I received it and now I can see it has 60 calories per tablespoon. Granulated sugar has only 45 calories per tablespoon. How could Agave Nectar be better than sugar?
5,"If you've tried the conventional Kettle crinkle chip verson Salt and Peper, you CAN'T compare these to those!  These are easily some of the most spicy chips you will ever eat, but oompletely enjoyable.  You finish the bag and the indside is just coated with spices.  Great stuff."
4,These chips are a great snack if you don't want all the junk assiciated with chips.  Try them you'll like them.
4,"I love these chips. The flavor is not plain. They are sweet and spicy all at the same time.  The only drawback is it has a tad bit too much salt. But, it still a great flavor!"
5,Just the right amount of spice to make them hot and they are also sweet! Very hard to find in New Jersey. Can not have just one bag around!!
5,I can't believe how wonderful this chip is! The slightly spicy after taste gives the chip extra punch and flavor. My family and I are offically addicted.
4,"These chips are perfect for snacking with or without salsa. The texture is brittle and thin, like other Plocky's chips.<br /><br />The only downside: the spice is minimal."
4,I think Plocky's brand as a whole is a cut above in quality but I found these to lack in taste somewhat and be a little greasy.
5,"These are the best chips I have ever eaten. Everyone in our family loves them. Sweet but spicy- crispy....really good. Delivery was perfect, no crushed chips. Fantastic overall."
5,A nice case of chips that are quite tasty. I definitely enjoy the Kettle Sea Salt and Black Pepper. I just wish they were bigger bags :)
5,"At first you think that these chips aren't all that Spicy, but the spice will grow on you with each bite.  They are really very good!"
5,"My aunt gave me a bag of these and I was immediately addicted. There are actual pieces of beans in the chips and they are not overly salty like other chips. I love the zip, agreed they are awesome without salsa, and no trans fat!"
5,"We love these chips. They can be eaten alone, since they are so crisp and tasty or with a dip. Every one that we have introduced the chips to, loves them. And the expiration date is for 8 months from now, so ordering 12 bags didn't come near to them going stale."
5,"I Love these chips for its unique taste and incredible crispy texture. Used to get them at Henry's in San Diego, CA before we moved out of there and have been ordering them from Amazon since. Running out of them constantly!"
4,These chips are the only ones I found to be tasty and healthy. They have fewer fat calories plus higher fiber for those who want good taste and nutrition--the perfect blend!
5,"We love these. Can't always get them in local stores, they don't keep them stocked even though we are always buying them out. Strong enough to dip in any condiment, great flavor and grain texture."
5,"I used to buy these at the local supermarket, but they are no longer carried there.  Finding them on Amazon I purchased a box and found they were fresh and delicious as I remembered.  For chips they are also very healthy.  I definately will buy them again."
5,Plocky's Red Beans and Rice Tortilla Chips are really tasty. I shared a few bags with my daughter in Iraq. She said Ummm they are Good. They are good for you too. No artificial stuff.
5,We like Plockys<br />They like us.<br />Plockys Plockys.<br />Mean no fuss.<br />Taste so good.<br />And healthy too.<br />Plockys Plockys.<br />Grab a bag or two.<br />Thank you Plockys!!
5,"I Love these potato chip they r soooo good! =) sweet and spicy but not overwhelming just enough to work up the palate, not salty just enough to balance out the sweetness I will be ordering these again soon. LOVe IT!"
5,The best potato chips I've ever had at the best price I've ever paid. The service was respectable and the shipping free.
5,I love this product.  All of the different flavors are fantastic.  My family likes the 3 grain the best.  No more corn tortilla chips in this house!
5,"Love these chips, and I don't even like black beans.  Very tasty.  Yum!!  Plus, good for you!"
5,These chips are FANFREAKINTASTIC. They are with out a doubt the best chips that I have ever had. A nice sweet smoky flavor and then a little bit-o-heat. OH YA BABY.
5,Nice amount of heat and smoke. Very tasty chip that goes great with a brew.
5,These chips are salty with a hint of sweet. They are crisp and crunchy. They are the best chips I've ever had!
5,"Ok. If you don't want to get addicted, don't try Plocky's Red Beans and Rice Tortilla Chips! My husband and I started with one seemingly anodyne bag from a store. Now, we've just received our second case. It won't last long. Beware."
5,We like these chips for salsa and quacomole better than any other cips on the market. They are even great by themselves. We will order these as long as they are available. Thank you for making them accessable.<br /><br />  Shelly Kenyon
3,"These were not flavorful enough for my taste. It seems that all the seasoning falls off the chips and sinks to the bottom of the bag. Too bad, because I really liked the idea of a healthier potato chip. I would not buy these again."
2,"I did not like these potatoe chips. It's hot, and sweet, with an overwhelming taste of garlic. It's also a bit salty."
5,They did a very good job with shipping the order quickly....Nothing like Ace Hardware who took a week to ship
5,"Wonderful candy, hard to find.  I got a huge bag and put it in freezer.  It came shipped nicely in a sturdy box and heavy plastic. Just great!"
4,I bought thi9s for my dad for a surprise birthday present because he could not find them any where else!!
5,"Well being the big red fan that I am, I bought some of this. First of all let me tell you the price is amazing, I mean where else can you get this type of deal in Saudi Arabia. Everyone in village loved it, of course now they are wondering when the next shipment will get it."
3,"Expiration date 1-13. Smashed and. stale. edible, not real enjoyable for the price I paid, One of the best pretzel's I had when<br />i purchased them from Publix. They stopped carrying them, I must find another addiction."
5,This cinnamon cake loaf has a wonderful natural flavor.  It's moist and tender and a great little sweet treat when you want something that isn't terribly bad for your diet.  It's delicious!
2,"Well, I opened it and it is grayish sticky mess. I'm so mad at myself for wasting my money, and not trying to make it from scratch at home. Which would probably end up better and cheaper. Oh well, live and learn!"
1,"I am glad I found this on the reduced rack for 99c. The taste was not bad but no way I could frost my cake. It stuck to the knife,ran down in strings,what a mess. I too thought I had gotten a bad batch.My GDs birthday cake looks like crap. Who would buy this mess. Horrible"
5,I work in college Financial Aid and keep a bowl of these on my desk for the students.  I used to buy them in the grocery store then learned I could get them for less online ($17 for 3lb bag) and thought that was a good deal - until I found this GREAT deal!
5,"If this flavor lasted longer than it does, I'd probably die of starvation for lack of wanting to take it out of my mouth."
5,this gum is super sick.tatooes are killin.flavor is a spankin'.this brings back bomb diggity memories yo.peace out.
2,"My husband and I were very disappointed in this coffee, very weak, watery cup of coffee. A definite waste of $13.00."
5,If you enjoy the flavor of soy you will really like this.<br /><br />Plus its hand made in the good ole USA.
5,"This soy sauce is the best we have ever had.  Thanks to Amazon, we were able to find it again.  It makes a big difference when using this product.  Thanks again"
5,This is the most delicious soy sauce I have ever tasted.  I will surely order it again.  Such deep flavor.
5,"Saw this on How it is made, which was a very interesting process.<br />Decided to give it a try, I really enjoy the flavor it adds.<br />Looking forward to trying it on several more dishes.<br />Thanks to those who brewed it!"
4,most soy sauce is from Japan but they are having problems with radiation in their soy bean fields. I am not sure how long the contamination will last. I like the idea this product claims no GMO seeds. yea  You pay more but decided not to take a chance on Japan.
1,"This item, WERTHER'S SUGAR FREE HARD CANDY, if consumed, will give you - or your friends, loose bowels. I purchased 12 bags and discovered more than a bowel problem: You can't return them. Need a laxative? I have ten unopened bags you can have - for free."
5,Of all the coffee's available for Tassimo this Kona has the richest flavor and fantastic aroma by<br />far my favorite.
5,I think these are my favorite cookies ever. Really light and creamy. Too bad you can no longer find them anywhere for less than two-hundred count! I don't think I need THAT many.
1,"This kind of tea not good ....!Taste and smell so wear it's not like tea ,and feel like some thing chemical."
5,"I ordered for my dad for fathers day and he ate the whole box within two days.<br />He said it tasted really good, now I want to order some for myself, haha."
4,"Great candy and our family loved it.  It was smaller than I imagined it and I thought it was expensive for how small it was.  However, I am in Germany and can get it easier here.  The shipping to the USA makes it expenive.  Great product and fun for our USA family to receive."
5,"I eat mustard with everything, this is hands down THE BESt mustard I have ever tried, in fact everyone I tell to try some, falls in love with it as well. Spicy, tasty, real quality.<br />If you like spicy mustard, you will love this."
1,The laddoos turned bad in a few days after we received it. No other item inside our fridge turned bad.
5,This product works wonders if you have stomach issues.  I would buy again once I need more. :0)
5,"Our ferret loves this rabbit; it's a nice high protein treat in addition to his regular Evo ferret diet. The price was reasonable compared to our local pet store, which doesn't often have this item in stock."
5,"These were great - just as described. Used them for a bee-themed party, and now we use them as ""to go"" packs of honey for our coffee and tea."
1,This is NOT Disco Dust which is edible and made for baking. DO NOT purchase this product for such purposes!
3,I was very happy with the quick shipping as i needed it for a school product for my daughter but when it came in the roof was broken and the corner of the house was broken. I couldn't send it back as i needed for a project.
2,"this isn't as easy as it looks, doesn't came with enough yellow frosting, and the frosting doesn't stick very well. My 5 year old did like making it though."
4,"These cookies were fun to paint but not too tasty to eat!<br />The kids did not really care much, but it might have been<br />more fun if they could have eaten them.<br /><br />They really had fun coloring them!"
2,"I was disappointed in this product because I thought it would be bigger.<br />Also, it did not come with enough icing. I had to use my own."
4,"This tea is the best tea i've ever had. i first tasted it in norway, and had to find it in the states. i have it every morning."
5,This is a good quality brand of chocolate with many flavours of which this is just one. Very tasty and a fast delivery too
5,"My mother and father were the recipient of these wonderful pieces of chocolate heaven.  They didn't believe they deserved receiving these, but I know they did deserve to receive these!"
3,"Of course, we all know how delicious Ghirardelli chocolate is!!!! Unfortunately, after I purchased two of these gift bags online, I found them in a local store for half the price. Lesson learned???!!!"
5,This chocolate treat is a great gift and it arrived right when I expected it to. I gave it to my girlfriend as a surprise gift and she absolutely loved it.
5,the first time i ordered this it came all melted but amazon was quick to remedy the situation by sending me another of the product and it was great thank you
3,Are people really paying 10 bucks for these chocolates??? ummmm go to any grocery store and by them for 2.98 a bag..wow
5,Low calorie and satisfying. These soups are a nice fill in when you don't want too much but don't want to be hungry for a few hours.
3,"It looks pretty, but the contents are very minute and seem to not be of very high quality. There's a plastic cup for the tea that looks like it came from a dollar store. The basket is nice, though."
5,Purchased this as a gift for my mother when it was a lightning deal.  She was very happy and loved the basket.  She enjoyed the cookies and the flavors of tea that were included.  Shipped quick and arrived when expected.
5,"Received very quickly and extremely well packaged.  Since this is a smaller sized basket, it would be an adorable present for anyone who likes tea, for self or just to have to hand.  Very nicely assembled with attention to detail."
5,"These small chocolate cups are a specialty party item that I have never been able to find in the past when I wanted them.  Amazon now provides a link.  They can be used for what are commonly called ""jello shots,"" and provide a solid edible alternative to small paper cups."
5,I bought these chocolate liquor cups for a party! It was a big hit. They are high quality and a good buy.
5,Great for serving Chocolate liquor. Adds a touch of class to your event and elevates you to host supreme. Being able to eat the cup afterwards is just icing on the cake.
5,The holiday liquor cups were exactly what I was looking for.  The chocolate is<br />delicious and holds up well to the liquors
4,"strawberry twist has a long-lasting pleasant flavor SWEET-but, not excessively so. delivery is timely and price is just right. Supieror to other TRIDENT flavors! Though, SPEARMINT isn't bad either. My next pick would be blueberry"
5,I love this flavor and I cant find it on the shelves anymore. The gum tasted fresh which is actually way better than when I used to buy it in stores!
5,BEST DOG FOOD ON THE MARKET TODAY.  HAD NUMEROUS EAR PROBLEMS WITH OUR COCKER SPANIEL AND THEY HAVE CLEARED UP SINCE TAKING THIS FOOD.
5,This is food especially designed for Cocker spaniels who have a range of health issues...I have been using this product with three of my dogs and all of them are very happy with it. It also is packaged very well and as a result stays fresh for a long period of time. Great product!
5,"fast and great service, my Cavashon Loves this low fat dog food. Thanks. Arrived in great condition, thank you thank you thank you"
5,"We are Chocolate Moose & Mickey Moose,<br /><br />Our nice owner bought this great food for us.  We love it very much, I have gained 5 lbs. because I eat all of Mickey's food when he isn't looking!  Our skin and fur is much better now too.  :)"
5,My 7 year old Cocker Spaniel loves this food and it's good for him -- he needs to lose a few pounds and this is doing the trick.  Glad I found it on Amazon.  Hard to find elsewhere.
5,"My 50lb bag of oatmeal seemed like way too much, but as time went on I found more and more uses for it. I have so many recipes that I make weekly that I'm running out! This is a very high quality oatmeal and much cheaper and better than anything I've found in the grocery store."
5,"Better than organic oats advertised elsewhere. Takes lots of water. These are not minute oats, so my oatmeal cookies come out right, not all crumbly and soggy. (Instant oats have their place, but not in cookies)."
5,"Nice flavor, not too bitter.  We really like this coffee.  We have been searching for a coffee that pleases the whole family's tastes and this is the one."
3,"The taste is harsh as it is a lesser grade of Yunnan. It is ok to drink, but not to really enjoy. I only make it for when I am in the hurry and will not be able to fully enjoy my tea anyway."
5,"I've used maybe half a dozen bags of this tea in the last year and it is a delicious, consistently good quality black tea. Mainly I use it and several other Numi teas in my tea blends for making kombucha."
5,I read the other reviews before purchasing am pleased that I did. I have purchased other Numi teas and gave generally been happy with all of theri products.
3,"To my mind, a fine caramel should be creamy and melting.  These are grainy.  The flavor on these was fine, although a little sweet to my taste."
5,This is certainly the best caramels I have ever had.  I just wish it came in bigger pieces.  I finished the whole box in one sitting!  I will certainly buy them again.
1,"Not my idea of a good caramel.  Flavors of ginger and pistachio dominated.  Same for the chocolate walnut and orange honey varieties. I missed the mix of rich, buttery, dairy flavor with caramelized sugar that I expect in caramels."
4,being an old chemist with a spectrophotometer I am pleased when the chemical is what they say it is this is what they advertized
5,"This baking soda works great for cooking or for health reasons.  I take it for acid indigestion and heart burn.  Just a 1 tsp in a half glass of water and it's gone.  I use it to make my body more alkaline, so it's great for changing your pH level in your body!"
5,"I recently started using Bob's Red Mill Baking Soda.  I'm very pleased with it's performance and I can be sure that it is not contaminated with aluminum.  Thanks, Bob!"
5,"Product is fresh, good and I'm not getting complaints anymore.<br /><br />That's worth the large quantity and shipping charges.<br /><br />Hey, its oatmeal. My favorite!"
5,"Good quality oats. Package came on time. Oats worked well in recipes. I will admit, as a single person I bought these oats with my boyfriend for breakfast food- it lasted us for the year.<br /><br />Otherwise it's an excellent buy."
2,"I can't eat these oats, they have a funny taste to them.  My kids also think they taste funny.  My husband thinks they are OK, so he has 50 pounds of oats to eat on his own!"
5,"Of the many purchses I made on Amazon this past December, I was most pleased with the Pocky Chocolate Cream Covered Biscuit Sticks (Pack of 10). They arrived on time, and they were a 'hit' as a surprised gift. Be sure to keep them refridgerated."
5,"Got these for my kids as Christmas stocking stuffers.  They love them.  As far as delivery, the product came in good condition, timely, and was terrific.  Definitely a good buy."
3,The chocolate on the stick was all melted and all the sticks were stuck with oneanother. The product and the concept is good but you will be better off buying it from a supermarket or directly get it from someone visiting Japan.
5,"First of all, I love the packaging making it heatproof but it wouldn't have been a problem because I ordered it it winter and they were freakishly cold. I also want to thank VeryAsia for the free sample of mi goreng...it was delicious!!! I now love mi goreng."
5,Bought these for my daughter's Grad party as well as the Strawberry. She loves these things. They're a great product.
4,Everyone in our family except one really likes the taste of this.  It is addicting.  That includes our 3 year old.
2,"I think the Pocky did not get stored rightly. The chocolate was falling off from the biscuit stick, and doesn't taste as it should. Many of them stick together, and whenever I want to split them up, it just becomes very messy. Now I need to clean up my desk every time after I have it."
5,Everyone loves Pocky and if they say they don't they are lying lol. The Pocky arrived in good condition with minimal melting and very few broken pieces.
5,"These where great couldnt stop eating them.<br />Lowest priced anywhere and will buy even more next time.<br />Cant say enough about these, they where shipped faster than what I paid to have shipped also.<br />Thank you so much."
5,"I had bought Pocky when on vacation and enjoyed it but living where there are no Asian stores I have to shop on the internet. The guys in the family seem to like it better than the ladies for some reason. For a bit of insanity, search for Pocky commercials on youtube!"
2,The individual Pocky sticks are not separately packaged and melt and stick together while being shipped.
5,My son with multiple food allergies really enjoys these bars.  I find that they have a good berry taste.  They also have a nice chewyness.
5,My son has severe allergies.  This is an item he loves and is a convenience for me.  I feel good giving them to him and they taste great!
4,"Tasty, convenient bars for people with celiac disease. They seem to have gotten smaller over time, but the taste and convenience outweigh the reduction in size (and the price)."
5,If you are looking for a great gluten free snack you won't be sorry you chose this product. My favorite flavor is the apple and nut.
5,Great taste. Great ingredients. Great texture. Absolutely delicious! They are a little smaller and you may still be hungry if it is for a meal. I give one to my 5 year old son for breakfast and he is still a little hungry for more. Either that or they taste so good he wants more.
5,"Recently diagnosed a gluten-intolerant, I have been looking for products that allow me to resume a semblance of my former life. These snack bars fit the bill. They have the mouth-feel of a traditional snack bar, and a pleasant tart-sweet fruit flavor."
4,"My son Loves these ""fruit bars"" they are smaller than your typical wheat fruit bars.  My suggestion it to get your child to like these first before you try the chocolate ones... Now my son favors them (chocolate) ones MORE than the berry ones..."
5,"If you want a really good snack bar try these, they are healthy and taste as good as any granola bar, but without the gluten!! I buy these regularly."
5,"This is the best coffee we've ever had. A light taste but very full bodied. I was very pleased with the packaging, having it resealable keeps it stay fresher much longer and unlike other brands this construction stays intact. I must say you wont be displeased with your purchase, this is a must buy!"
4,"Numi has a winner here with this tea! My husband, son and I often share this wonderful tea after dinner. It is very pleasant and the reason they love it, it does not turn bitter after longer steeping, like other teas do!"
5,"My little girl can't get enough of this! I like that it is organic and contains fruit, veggies, protein and grains in one tasty meal. I wish it came in larger portions since my 10 month old always wants 2 jars."
5,"Its my daughter's favorite first and foremost.  For me I love that i can get lentils, there aren't many stage 2 or 3 vegetarian choices."
5,"This is my son's favorite dinner! Best of all it seems it has the best combo of protein (21%) , vitamin A (100%) and C (30%). It is runnier than most of their dinners which was a great start for solids with protein in it. Love love love this brand and flavor. I think I purchased 50 jars so far."
5,"I don't know how everyone else got these broken, but when I received them they came wrapped in plastic and in bubble wrap, not a single jar was broken.  My son loves them and the price was great and I had no issues at all."
3,Would be a quality product if it weren't so thin. Nearly the consistency of soup. It just makes too much of a mess no matter how careful you try to be.
4,"We love earth's best organic baby food, but this is not the tastiest one. I've tried it myself and think it is pretty gross. But my daughter still eats it, just not with as much enthusiasm as other flavors. It's got a decent amount of protein, which is important for us as a vegetarian family."
5,Soft smooth texture - my little one devours this one...it is one of the best meat/veg dinners we have found!
1,"My triplets will not eat this, eventhe one who will eat ANYTHING. The consistency is way too runny as well and does not stay on the spoon."
3,"My baby LOVES sweet potatoes. I can essentially mix any food into sweet potatoes and he will eat them; which in this case could be a good or bad thing depending on what I wanted to mix in there... it was horribly runny, like spooning formula into his mouth. Ick."
5,This is the only food my daughter will eat consistly. She really enjoys it. The packaging is great. Never had any broken (having ordered 4 times).
5,My son loves the rice and lentil jars.  It's not as liquid in consistency as the peas and brown rice jars.  I have it on order with subscribe and save + amazon mom and it always arrives nicely packaged.
5,"I have twin girls, they both loved the Vegetable Turkey Dinner.  It was one of their favorite baby foods.  Great price."
5,My son really enjoys Earth's Best lentil!  He eats the entire jar for dinner and always wants more.  The product shipped very quickly.
5,I love the fact that there is turkey being offered. This is my son's 2nd favorite dish. No issues with it and a good balance of nutrients.
1,Only three jars came in a form edible to babies.  The rest of them were filled will a clump of spongy mush that would not mix with the water.  It also had a brown color and not the yellowish brown like the jars that had the good mixture.<br />Pretty disappointing and a waste of money.
5,"This is one of my son's favorite baby foods.  It does have a bit of sweetness, but not too sweet.  It's more runny than some of the other flavors, so we use a deeper spoon with this one, or add a little rice cereal to thicken it up."
4,"For whatever reason, our son really likes this flavor. I'm not a fan myself, but I'm not the one eating it. Any time I can get a variety of vegetables into my baby in one sitting, I'm a happy mom."
5,I always try the food before I feed it to my daughter and this one is actually pretty good. My daughter LOVES it. She gets all excited when I make it for her
3,"Little Baby Picky will only eat this sometimes. This one is more watery than the others, so keep that in mind. Reviewing baby food is objective since all children are different, so I hope letting you know the consistency and texture help."
5,"I have 12 month olds and no time to write a great review, but they like all the flavors, the textures are great, and the jars open easily. Great on the go snack."
5,My baby loves Rice and Lentil and is one of her favorite things to eat.  If we are going somewhere I won't be able to warm the food she will eat this one cold.
5,My daughter loved this stuff. It is all natural and made very well.  Good to mix with other things as they get older too!  Beats Gerber.
5,"My daughter is outgrowing baby food but will still eat this.  We tried 3rd foods on her and she doesn't like the texture of them.  This is really good for her and she likes it, so we keep buying it."
5,My son loves the Best Earth's baby food and his favorite seems to be the Vegetable and Turkey. He smiles at every mouthful.<br /><br />I would recommend this product to anyone who is looking for healthy feeding the organic way. All the food I feed my son is through Earth's Best.
1,To be fair only one of my twins got gas from this but it was horrible. Up all night screaming from gas pains. Garbanzo beans are not an ideal food for young babies.
5,"My six month old baby loves the Earth's Best 2nd Sweet Potato Chicken Dinner - it's his favorite. He seems to love all the Earth's Best 2nd foods - fruits, vegetables, and dinners. The consistency of the food makes it easy for him to eat - not too thick, not too thin."
5,"The earths best he eats the most, this one is a little thicker than his original chicken/sweet potato favorite which is very runny."
5,I'd continue to buy but I'm moving over to more home made finger foods and away from glass jars...shattered too many. They like all the flavors though. Great textures too.
4,Pretty good product.  The taste isn't the best but it's definitely not the worse either.  It gives a pretty smooth energetic kick.
5,"I am a true Seattle coffee addict, and I have never had a better coffee candy."
4,Sent this basket to my father for his birthday.  He said the fruit was very fresh and sweet.  Happy with this healthy purchase!
5,"I got it for my Girlfriend for her Birthday.  The Fruit actually tasted fresh and yummy!  I love dark chocolate, so I loved the dark chocolate almonds.  Next time I'll give the Organic version of this product... to someone close so they share with me  :)"
4,I ordered this on-line and received it in just a few days (3).  The tea is excellent and the price was right for  me.
5,"I purchased this tea for my neighbor as a present, she has been looking for sassafras tea for a long time, I didn't realize it was so hard to find!  She absolutely loves it, made a great surprise christmas gift."
5,I heard some great things about Sassafras and wanted to try it.  I was worried about the taste but it turned out to be a lot better than i anticipated.  I'm actually gonna order the 4-pack and continue drinking it over time.  Don't trust the FDA!!
5,"bought this for my dad. for about 2 years he would complain to be about how he hasn't had this tea since he was about 9. finally, after many nights of drinking my tea annoyed, i bought him the tea so he'd shut up."
5,Great tasting tea I have been looking for a good  Sassafras tea forever.Finally. I will be ordering this product again .<br />Thanks Kim:D
2,"I did not care for this product at all, I thought it was the same tea my sisters and I use to drink when we were in elementary school. I found out the tea we use to drink actually came from the root of a particular type of tree."
2,"I purchased this because I read that it was a natural cure for hives..Um, how about NOT.  It did nothing for my hives and it tastes awful.  Luckily, a co-worker of mine loves this stuff (reminds him of his grandmother) and I gave it to him.  Yucky, yucky stuff."
5,"This gravy mix is excellent ... except, don't use water where called for, use milk instead, and it makes it 100% better!!"
5,Nothing easier. Nothing better. Even beats grandmother's white gravy recipe. Already peppered for you. You do nothing but mix it with water. Takes only a minute or two. I highly recommend this gravy mix. It will not disappoint.
5,"I have used Pioneer Gravy for a number of years.  It is VERY easy to make and tastes great, also.  Goes very well over mashed potatoes, meats, etc.  Try it!"
5,"Its great to be able to get sugar this way.Its not good to eat but if you are going to use sugar at least this is not processed to an unhealthy state on top of what sugar does to your body,and i am helping the  fair trade farmers.It is a good thing all around.I am happy i can get it in Amazon."
5,I keep Regular bags and Decaf bags in my home at all times.<br />Never have to drink old coffee.  Best way to make iced coffee.
4,I live in the dorms without a kitchen so making a cup of coffee was really easy with this. Especially when I need to stay up late to study or to wake up after 2 hours of sleep. Its just like making tea and tastes decent enough. Not starbucks but good enough with some sugar and cream.
5,"These are great for at work, just pop the instant bag in for a minute then make your coffee. This is the best tasting coffee. It's easy to make without a mess."
5,"Fast, easy and definitely delicious.  Makes a great cup of coffee and very easy to make.  Good purchase.  Will continue to order from here.<br />Thanx..."
5,"I tried this before having normal red tea so I waited to review. The flavor still rings in my head it is earthier than rooibos tea and less frity. The color is that of muddy water, and it has the grittiness and viscosity of it as well. Well worth every penny."
5,"This is the very best marinade you can buy as far as I am concerned---of course, everyone to his or her own tastes, but all in all, I think anyone will like it---I give it five stars..."
5,My poland spring driver gave us this new tea to try and<br />our family really enjoyed it. I looked at the ingredients and was quite pleased<br />with the natural ingredients and no calories.
5,This is my favorite hot sauce! I liketo use it to give anything some extra flavor. I have loved going out to some of my favorite resturants in town and seeing that they are offering this great product.I really enjoy putting on my my breakfast burritos!
5,"I was browsing around on Amazon looking for gifts and was very pleased to see my favorite sauce on here. I will just order and have shipped to my friends. Habanero is my favorite, I love the heat and the tangy spiciness. I also love the pineapple. You will not go wrong ordering this up."
5,This is my favorite hot sauce. I buy it locally and love the flavor that they all have. Hopefully the other flavors will show up on amazon for people to enjoy! My favorites are the medium and pineapple flavored ones so far. Thank you for making a flavorful hot sauce!
5,"absolutely love the habenaro sauce...use it on eggs, sandwiches most anything for a good kick! have watched the progessing popularity of theis homegrown product...have nothing but the highes accolades for the chef and the product..get out there and try it!"
5,"this sauce is so good with just about anything, i like adding it to asian food or anything with egg or noodles, it has a good burn with a strong flavor. im hoping to see some of the other flavors like the pineapple experiment on here soon. buy it you wont regret it"
1,"Not hot at all. Like the other low star reviewer, I got suckered by seeing 'habenero' in the name and the 12 oz size. Some people might like the flavor, citrus-y and it has some fish sauce in the mix (according to the ingredient label), but if you're looking for hot this ain't it"
5,I never in my life tasted such a good babka its crazy good! This is the real babka! That my gram mother use to make
4,"I am so convinced these are human animal crackers. They look and taste EXACTLY like human ones (yes, I tasted it) and they contain sugar, which is not one of the last ingredients in the nutrition facts either. So ill just give my dog very small amounts."
5,I have a whole box of peanut butter dog cookies and she wont touch them. She loves these and begs for them so it was a good buy. She is a little chihuhua and they are not too big for her mouth. About 20 per box.
5,My chihuahua loves these lil snacks. When she sees me bring out the yellow bus she literally runs in circles!
5,I purchased these little treats as stocking stuffers for our little furry friends.  Both Yorkies LOVED these treats.  We had to finally buy more since they liked them so much.
5,These are just like the animal crackers we eat.  The price is great and my little guy loves them!
2,Ive been craving some deer jerky for a while so i gave this one and some others on amazon a try. This one was very sinue and a little too sweet for my taste. Not going to buy again. Im still on my search for the salty dry version im after
5,"I tried this and I found it too salty.<br />Plus I ate this fish sauce with some fish but I realized it was kind of redundant.<br /><br />I'm kidding, of course. This stuff is great!"
5,I don't usually drink tea but I love this one. I thought the shipping price was a little high but love the tea so much that I had to get it. Perfect with a little bit of Honey.
1,The noodles in the box were all broken.  The sauce was over salted and did not have a good flavor.  I threw out most of the skillet.  I would recommend not purchasing this product.
5,"Cavenders makes the best vinegar and oil dressing ever. couple of tbls of cavenders and 1/4 vinager and 1/4 h2O, rest oil. good!"
5,"It's balanced, it's tasty, it's filling, it's good for you -- what more could you ask of a breakfast cereal?<br /><br />I still miss Kellogg's sister product, Just Right, which was a somewhat lighter blend (I loved it, they discontinued it), but Mueslix is a strong second-best."
5,Don't know why I can't find these in my supermarket but I can't.  You get pack of 5 when you order.  Was afraid 5 boxes would last too long.  Instead found I need to order another 5-pack.
2,"Recently purchased this cereal assuming it would contain nothing but healthy ingredients, then I read the label and discovered it contains partially hydrogenated soybean oil and high fructose corn syrup."
5,"This cereal is difficult to find in the stores so I appreciate being able to purchase it through Amazon.  My husband really likes it and looks forward to the delivering of it every month.  Seems like an unlikely thing to look forward to, but it's the little things that count.  P. Looney"
5,"You could find this in local supermarkets about 4 months ago but now it nowhere to be found. Every time Kellogg's makes a great cereal, they quit making it soon after. This is the case with Just Right, THAT WAS THE BEST STUFF ON THE PLANET!"
5,"This has been my favorite cereal for probably 20 years.  The grocery stores stopped selling it, so I've started buying it on the web in packs of 5 boxes.  I use them up pretty fast."
5,"I LOVE THIS CEREAL.  NOT ONLY DOES IT TASTE GOOD, IT'S GOOD FOR YOU.  IT'S A PITY THAT I CAN'T FIND THIS CEREAL IN ANY OF THE LOCAL SUPERMARKETS.  OTHER BRANDS DO NOT MATCH UP."
5,"Amazon's price may be higher than some grocery stores, but it isn't in my store so this is a good way to shop.<br />I first tried this on a Princess cruise ship.  I found it is very good and filling.  It stays with me, which is very important.<br />I am super please to find this!"
5,"I almost can't stop eating this cereal...I eat it for breakfast and then in the evening, when I think I want something to eat and am really not hungry, I snack on these.  After all, it's healthy, so long as I remembeer it's not healthy to eat a cup or more.  Enjoy!"
5,Our local stores all stopped carrying this product and were putting their own imitation brands on the shelf......just not the same!  Great that I could order and have my cereal within days!
5,"This cereal is hard to find in local stores where I live. My wife and I love this cereal for its taste and healthfulness. Whenever I find it in some hotel breakfast buffets, I am a happy man. I cannot think of eating any other cereal."
5,"Kellogg's Mueslix had replaced local muesli previously served in European B&B's on our last trip. Not available locally, but Amazon provided with a fair price, rapid delivery and no shipping cost with my Prime Shipping. Excellent form of Muesli!"
5,Eating healthy never tasted so good. Tough to find in my local stores but Amazon has it at a great price especially through subscribe and save.
5,"The Kelloggs Muselix are delicious and the delivery was quick.<a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001E6KBSK"">Kellogg's Crispy Blend Mueslix Raisins, Dates & Almonds, 15.3-Ounce Unit (Pack of 5)</a>"
5,"This cereal is the best cereal on the market.  It has many flavors, including nuts, raisins, dates, and especially a light malt flavor.  I have enjoyed it most mornings for years."
5,"I have been eating Kellogg's Mueslix for years. I love the mix of fruit, almonds, and whole grain. It used to be easy to find but when I couldn't find it in my local super markets, I was afraid it had been discontinued. When I found it on Amazon, I was pretty happy."
5,"It was a sad moment when I was unable to find my favorite cereal in the grocery stores.  I'm not sure why it disappeared, but am so grateful I'm able to purchace this online.  Thanks!"
5,its hard to find in the us my husband frm jamaica and he loves it he says it makes him fill full all day i get it every mo.
4,"I have been struggling to find them in the shops nearby.<br />Much more convenient to order them through Amazon (slightly more expensive, but I save the gas and the burden)."
5,The Kellogg Mueslix Cereal was ordered one evening and just a couple of days later it arrived. The item was well packed. Contents were fresh. Encountered no problems<br />and plan to use this resource again.
5,"Local grocery stores don't carry this cereal so I order it. It is full of nuts, raisins, and other great stuff. I cut up a banana in it instead of adding sugar. My favorite box cereal."
3,"i bought the liter size bottles of this dressing on Amazon, so i am assuming they are the same since they have the same name and the nutritional facts are identical. This dressing is definitely too sweet for my taste. My wife agrees. Otherwise very good. I use it on tossed salads only."
1,Coffee beans did not seem fresh.  No oil on them what so ever.  I have tasted much better and fresher.  Will not order again.
5,"This coffee company delivers on great coffee taste!!  I like my coffee with deep, robust taste and Jeremiah's always is!!  It makes me glad to purchase it!!  Thanks!!"
1,Tossed this out after trying it.  Texture and taste were far below expectations.  Seemed kind of mushy and pasty.  Pricy to boot.
5,I actually gave these to a local baker for my daughters cupcakes. They looked great. Showed up perfectly on white and chocolate icing. In great shape.
5,"This is my very favorite tea of all. I drink it year-round and never get tired of it like I do of others. It's good any time of the day. Not too strong, but still nicely flavorful, with a good balance of minty/spicy/herbal-y."
3,I was expecting to receive only Starburst. When I received this it was half Skittles which I did not want or need.  I needed only Starburst.  Next time I will just go to the store.
5,"Walker's Highlanders are my favorite purchased cookie, so it was great to find them pre-packaged into 2 biscuits. Keeps them fresh longer and limits my snacking!"
5,"If you like Shortbread you will really like these. Walkers always makes the best Shortbread.<br /><a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001GCVLXG"">Walkers Shortbread Highlander Shortbread Portion Pack, 1.4 Ounce Units (Pack of 24)</a>"
5,COULDN'T FIND THESE ANYWHERE BUT ON LINE - IT WAS WORTH THE WAIT BECAUSE THEY ARE TRULLY GREAT TASTING COOKIES.
5,We love these sugar cubes in the office.  They aren't your grandmother's sugar cube.  They have a rugged appearance (can sugar cubes be considered rugged).  And we combine them with the white sugar cubes from La Perruche.
4,Love this for espressos...the raw sugar cube is not as sweet as the refined sugars and more rich in flavor.
3,"It's a good idea to have raw sugar type cubes, but this was 3x the cost of granulated raw sugar"
1,Was really bummed to find out that these chocolates had melted before they got to my daughter for her bday.  Seems that they should not be sold online if there is not a way to keep them 'safe'.  :-(
5,"If you love garlic, I recommend this flavored oil.  It is true to its name.  I was not expecting it to be so strong, so if I use it for cooking or dipping bread, I will mix it with some unflavored olive oil in the future."
5,"Love these mints.  They melt in your mouth and taste better than any others I have tried.  Just wish they weren't so expensive.  You can't eat just one, a couple.  They are addictively delicious."
5,I got it for my girlfriend. Very good stuff. Now everybody in the house eats them. Very hight quality if you are into chocolate and mint.
5,"This is the real deal. Genmai Cha. Loose green tea and roasted brown rice. Not in bags. Originally known as the ""Peoples Tea"" for those who couldn't afford better. Very popular because of its mild flavor. You can drink it all day long (like I do). You won't be disappointed."
1,All my fault. I thought this would be a carton of 3 boxes of cereal.  Instead it was 1 box of cereal for 12.99. Who sells cereal for this price plus $8.00 shipping ? I feel stupid!  Buyer Beware!
2,I ordered both the beef and Turkey flavors. My dogs would not even take these in their mouths. Both flavors were  very dry and had no real aroma to them. Try a small quantity first. i  donated the entire order to the Humane Society.
3,"This does not reflect on the product but my shi-tzus took them and left them laying on the carpet. Normally with chicken or turkey snacks, they go nuts.I donated both containers to the Humane Society. I'd try a smaller quantity for a first order."
5,"My partner is very happy with the tea, and is feeling much better since starting to drink it.<br />She has been drinking it both hot (normal) and iced (chilled) and likes the refreshing nature of it."
5,"This tea won an award in the USA and I know why....""Mandarin Silk Loose Leaf Oolong Tea""  is like the name suggests ""Silk"" silk on your tongue.  A tea that has a warm, relaxing taste that makes you feel wonderful...Well done ""Art of Tea""!"
5,"These are some of my favorite chips on the planet! They are light, crisp, & not too greasy. The flavor is very Dilly. Love that! Great chips. Just hard to find."
3,"4 bags of chips were open when I received the shipment. I am hoping that the chips were<br />blew open during shipment in flight.  No more chips for me through Amazon.  Otherwise,<br />the chips are good to eat and very salty."
5,"Not as thick as kettle chips we have had in the past, definitely more like a potato chip and the college crowd loves it.  Interestingly enough they feel more 'gourmet' when eating these. The flavor is not heavily garlic while you can easily taste the cheese."
5,"I thought they were very good chips, delicious!  and as soon as i run out, i'll be ordering more very soon."
5,"These are hard to find, but worth the trouble.  Very tasty and very reasonably priced.  Love the product, and received very quickly."
5,"It's difficult to purchase ""no-salt"" potato chips at most retail stores, so I ordered a case of 3 ounce bags of Uncle Rays.  They are great.  Not oily and they taste great.  You get the potato flavor instead of just salt.  I'll be buying these from now on!"
4,"We can rarely find these potato chips where we live, so I decided to find them online to satisfy our cravings. We cannot be happier with the ordering from Amazon! The chips arrived fast and in a box that protected them from crushing. Excellent and will be ordering again!"
5,Who doesn't like vegetables that are portable and at a great price?  Can't beat the convenience at about 4 cents per package!
5,"Everything AmeriColor that I have purchased works great! I was looking for some lighter tone colors, everything I had was pretty bright. These sheen colors are light with a pretty sheen, it's great! Thank you!"
5,"I love the metallic and sheen colors.  In a photo, the items airbrushed with the silver and gold look real.  The sheen really kicks the color up a notch."
5,ordered these for my daughters wedding cake overnight so that i would get them the next day<br />they came four days after wedding<br />but they are nice
5,"Sent very prompty, tea is delicious, will continue to use this company with great enthusiasm."
5,I loved this tea! It is refreshing and delicious with or without sweetener. A great buy! I would definitely recommend this product!
5,"3 boxes, under $6 each for all cherry - great buy.  I couldn't find all cherry in the store and don't really care for the other flavors."
4,Almost 150 Charms Blow Pops for less the 10 cents each.  These are great for bribing my children and a trip down memory lane.
1,"Be careful!  I ordered a pack of 6, my invoice says pack of 6, but I received only 1 stick."
4,this salsa is definitely one for the books!! A perfect blend of the jolokia pepper and seasonings that made this the perfect dip for half-time.. Grown men crying because it's soooo hot is a small price to pay for this awesomeness in a jar... perfect for my cream cheese dip too! A+ across the board.
5,"I am very acustom to spicy foods and this has a very rich flavor. Half the bottle was devoted to given people my ""not so hot salsa "" reactions amazing . Worth the money! as for me eating it the title says it all"
5,my cats favorite cat food he is very pickey and will not eat a lot of different cat foods but he loves this one
5,"There are 4 kittens that started hanging outside the house and I started feeding them.  Rather than buying the smaller bags, this is a great value for multiple cats.  The kittens love the food and always look forward to eating it.  Shipped right to your door.  Can't go wrong with that!"
4,"I purchase 2 15 pound bags of 9 Lives Daily Essentials a month for my daughter's cats. They love it. She says they often gather around the carton and wait for her to open it. They know what's in there and can't wait for it to be opened. If the cats love it, we love it. Isn't that how it goes?"
5,My cats love this food. For the money it is a great product. I get it every month.  The cats love the flavor.
5,My two cats love this cat food more than the kirkland signature brand.  It's also very cheap and affordable cat food at walmart. I would recommend this cat food over meow mix or friskies any day.  Get 9lives dry cat food.  It's one of the better brands out there.
5,One of my kitties is a complete snob when it comes to food and she loves this. Great product to buy.
1,"My cat will NOT eat this food. I don't know why, but it was a waste of money. I was looking for something cheap so I guess you get what you pay for."
5,i love these pop.  these are rather small pops about 1/2 the size of a tootsie pop.  they come in many flavors.  i think this bag is great in the long run.  300 just think Halloween.
5,dum dum lolly pops are the best! they come i lots of kinds and tast really good!
2,I like the fact that this vanilla flavor has no alcohol in it so i could add it to my baby's pancakes.  It does not taste the same to me as the regular stuff.  It is rather bland in my opinion.
5,"I prefer the taste of this over the alcohol-based vanilla extracts, particularly in uncooked items and beverages. It has a fairly thick/syrupy consistency."
5,"Raw, Organic, Fair Trade, Tastes Great... What's not to love? My hope is that as more people buy their amazing chocolates that the price will come down a bit."
1,"Items in this Gift Basket was delivered to people who called me to say ""could not eat any of it, because everything was old and stale.""  I was sad and disappointed. Time and effort, as well as money to get this, only to find out - terrible."
1,Very disappointed with purchase.  The dates were so dried up where it tasted like leather instead of dates.  Must have been sitting there for a long long time.
2,"I ordered three of the trays (being a date nut) and found that two were old or stale. I admit to not checking the out-of-date on the exterior package, but still - dried out fruit.?! The last tray was fresher, but the experience was soured at that point. I'm disappointed."
5,"Bought this for my mom for her birthday, she was dying to open it so we could all try it. It was nice and fresh and everything tasted great! Wish I had bought one for myself!"
4,"Expensive, but worth it, and Ive tried every Iced tea out there. Lipton is pretty good too, but this is the best!! Tetleys sux, and many other Iced teas like Bigelow are terrible, but this is great! Like the coffee shop"
5,"I have nine cats and they are crazy about these kibbles! The last thing you want is 20lbs of cat food the cats hate, but I'll be buying them more of this..."
1,This vendor is unscrupulous. She ripped off her cultures from other collectors and shamelessly claims them as her own. She has no conscience and I would highly recommend that you do your purchasing elsewhere.
5,I have used your product for years and find myself in a town where they are sold only in very small bottles.  I am used to buying your product by the half gallon and would like to make my purchases online.  I have tried using other products which pale in comparison to your Original Barbecue Sauce.
5,Very firm small pieces with an intense licorice flavor. I love black licorice and have been trying different gluten free options. I will be ordering more of this one.
2,"I don't know whether it was a fault in the packaging or if they were just past their prime, but they were rock hard and the flavor was not strong enough."
3,Cans are lined w/ material that contains BPA which means the effort to grow the tomatoes organically was a waste of time.<br /><br />12-5-10  I didn't see the liner when I opened a different can from the same case.  I'm scratching my head.
4,"These arent diced, its just mush, But I like the no bpa and would buy again for that reason- but dont expect diced."
5,"Well one of my friends asked for a really big bag of gummy bears, she was very pleased when she opened the box. Than her co-worker really like these gummy bears to."
5,I have been eating these since about 5 years old and are my favorite chips in the world! just dont eat too many of them!
5,"I love these chips and couldn't contain my happiness when I recieved my box!! Love them, if you love spicy foods...get these!!"
3,"I ordered 48 lollipops to use as party favors only to be disappointed that the front and back of the candy had writing on it. So I rewrapped them using clear bags purchased from Michaels. Also a few were cracked or broken, so luckily I ordered more than enough. Unwrapped they are so adorable!"
5,I used these and a bunch of other colored lollipops for a friend's birthday and she got a kick out of it.  She had been complaining about feeling old so we threw a kid themed party.  She had a great time.  I don't think it's possible to eat one of these spiral lollipops without feeling like a kid!
5,I used these lollipops for a candy princess costume for my daughter. They came in perfect condition and exactly like the picture shows. They do come in a group of 16...such a great value! I was extremely satisfied!
5,I bought these lollipops for my daughter's 3rd Birthday. They are super cute and the kids loved them. Definitely met my expectations.
5,I got these for my sons 3rd birthday. I got it because I am doing a candy station for his birthday & I wanted to put colorful lollipops as part of the candy station. So this is just perfect for my idea.
5,"I used this for my daughters candy land birthday party and the kids loved them! They aren't full size, but they are still sooooo cute!!!"
5,Bought these for a birthday and they were perfect--all arrived uncracked and wrapped really well. Super cute and perfect for 4 year olds.
1,"I opened this product to find that the lollipops were all broke, I was very disappointed.  They did not package this product in a way that would help keep it from breaking.  You are better off buying them from a store around your area."
5,"These arrived securely packaged, not even a chip on one lollipop.  They also tasted really good and looked very pretty at my sister's baby shower.  I would buy these again for myself and suggest to future buyers!"
4,"I'm going to guess that 'Yuck' didn't mix it up right, because, frankly, these taste surprisingly good considering they're supposed to be lo-carb. They're easy to make, and the non-diabetic in the house thinks they're just as tasty as I do. I do agree that the price is pretty outrageous, though."
1,"This muffin mix is awful,..all you taste is flour and sour cream,.which is used to make these.  It just tastes wierd. I've tried and tried,..<br />there are no good tasting low carb ""treats"",..esp. for diabetics."
5,"I love Salsa and have tried many on the market. I served Dippin Fiesta at a recent Sunday football get together and got rave reviews. Maybe the best Salsa I have ever tasted and served. If you want to taste the best, try this one."
5,"I made these recently for a holiday party.  I have never seen anything go so fast!<br /><br />They were very easy to make-- just add a few ingredients, mix, and throw them in the oven.  I will definitely be buying and making these again."
5,"These are not as good at Houston's Samba Grill but they tasted great. The texture is different but in lieu of having these on a daily basis, I have found something that I can make. I would surely recommend these to anyonr."
5,My item got to my house on time and I was surprised on how well my package was packed. I recommend this store to anyone;)
3,"These are tiny packets. I bought them thinking they were the regular size and are not. My kids love the product, but this particular package was outrageously expensive for tiny packages. I sent them back."
4,"They are more potato crockets in the shape of a ball rather than Au Gratin, but nevertheless YUM YUM YUM!"
1,Not happy with the product.  Once they were cooked the potatoes were flat and didn't look any thing like the product picture that was seen.  The shipping cost as much as the potatoes did!
5,I love to order these type of cooked potatoes and they are so great with a steak...
4,I really like this product.  It tasted great and only took a few minutes to make in the microwave.
5,"Very good side dish, easy to make, easy to eat.  As others have said, needs a little spice, but other than that they are delicious!"
5,"excellent - will order again!!  It's nice to be able to order Omaha items from Amazon because Amazon ships SOOO fast, and payments are so convenient."
5,"I was surprised at the size of these potatoes. I have bought them at my local grocery store before and was disappointed that they were so small. These are perfect!! Tasty, cook just right. Love 'em!!"
3,"These potatoes are good.  But i don't know if I'd get them again.  The garlic taste to me was off and strong.  And I LOVE garlic.  Hoping I just got an ""off"" batch."
4,"Excellent and tasty though I thought not enough garlic so I added more. When I order GARLIC I guess I expect more of it.  But perfect if you have guests as it will never offend anyone. Omaha always is sure to do everything to please their customers, a premier company, hard to find anymore."
4,We had these along with Omaha prime rib. Both were great. Two where plenty to fill up. Made them in toaster oven in less then 20 minutes.
5,These potatoes are really very good.  My husband and I both *love* them.  And way too easy.  We will be buying more of these.
5,"So so good!  Delicious, easy to prepare food!  I would definitely order again.  Had a gourmet taste, and took only minutes to get ready.  Yum!!!"
4,I like em but nothing unique about the flavor.  basically saves you from having to make them at home... a little pricey but for a treat what the heck
4,They taste pretty good. I eat one of these with some of the poultry selections from Omaha Steaks. It makes a great meal.
5,These potatoes are pretty good. They can be eaten alone or served with a meal. Really like potatoes and this is an easy choice.
3,"Omaha Steaks 8 (5.75 oz.) Stuffed Baked Potatoes<br /> '''<br />The Stuffed Baked Potatoes were unimpressive and<br />lacking in flavor.<br /><br />I tasted no bacon or chives.<br /><br />However, they do make an attractive addition to a<br />meal."
5,"I prepare these baked potatoes in a toaster oven. They are the perfect compliment to a hamburger, steak or chicken entree. Try them. You'll like them!"
5,Very good transaction and Omaha food was sent properly.  I already left one feedback.
5,These potatoes are very good along with all their steaks and hamburgers.  I would definately recommend Omaha Steaks to anyone looking for a gourmet dinner at a reasonable price!
5,ENERGY BITES F'ING RIP YOUR FACE OFF WITH MOLTEN LAVA ENERGY.<br /><br />INFINITY ENERGY TO THE F'ING MAX.  I ATE A WHOLE BOX ONCE AND THREW A CAR AT A BABY.<br /><br />F'ING RAVE.<br /><br />SERIOUSLY THESE ARE GREAT.
3,a $5000.00 diamond would be cheaper to ship than a $5000.00 car!  I don't buy from any supplier that ships by price.<br />This item is $7.95 then you pay $11.95 for up to $20.00 for shipping? No way I would pay that for one jar.
1,Where's the ingredient list for this product?  Thought all foods were supposed to have it.  Would never buy any food without first knowing what's in it!
4,"It's a great product- especially if you like garlic! No need for ""slicing & dicing! (Which is a good thing when your right side is ""stroke paralized""!) Just garlic too- not an ""oily & salty product"" Just plain or roasted GARLIC ! And it lasts a long time too!"
5,"I love my garlic spray so much, that i ordered more! I grow garlic, but I don't even bother juicing them anymore, not with this product. There are 150 cloves in every bottle. Thats a lot of yummy garlic..."
5,"Butternut Mountain Maple Syrup is the real deal. The grade B is wonderful on pancakes, or in coffee- just about on anything you'd like sweetened.<br />Delivery was timely and the product came as expected. I recommend this!"
5,This was a really good idea and the final product is outstanding. I use the decals on my car window and everybody asks where i bought the decals i made.  Two thumbs up!
5,It's a long time since Iv'e eaten Spam but I decided to give it a try. I always had left overs before but with this size can I simply enjoy every bit in one serving.
5,Well worth the price.  Very large chocolate truffles that taste amazing.  Can't wait for Amazon to get them again.  1 January 2012. Just browsed to the truffle page and had a mini heart attack when I saw the price.  They were $12.00 when I purchased them in 2011.
5,Excellent product.  Crab Cakes made with lump style crabmeat has been a family tradition during Christmas holidays for over 40 years.  Local grocery stores do not carry lump style and only offer fancy/minced crab meat which is OK but not as satisfatory as lump style.
5,THESE TREATS ARE THE ONLY ONES MY 14 YEAR OLD DOG WILL EAT. SHE LOVES THEM.
5,"She will play with it before eating it.  Since she is small it acts like a tiny ball for her.  They are expensive, but less so at Amazon than at a pet store."
5,I have three small dogs and these are one of their favorite treats!  I don't have to worry about them choking and I feel I am giving them a healthy treat!  Please don't ever stop making them Pet N Shape.
5,Terrific with English Triffle.  Beware though the pack of 6; each of the 6 containers makes about a gallon of pudding.
5,I am from England and I was raised on this custard. If you like vanilla custard/pudding you will love this. It's rich and creamy and has lots of vanilla taste.  I love that it comes in a big canister and I can make as much as I want to. I would never make a trifle with anything else.
5,"This is a great product, we have made custard with it for years and it always makes great custard. We will purchase this product again. Amazon does a great job of getting us our purchases fast and without damage."
5,life without bird's custard has been hell ! i've tried other varieties-sthg from holland if i recall correctly-just not up to snuff...i ordered 6 to ensure i never run out ! better than ice cream and not half as fattening.
5,"Hard to find locally. Great price, especially with the free shipping.  Have enough to share with family and friends."
5,"This is a wonderful and very handy product.  I'm thrilled by all the yummy ways this can be used.  My aunt, who lived in Ireland for 7 years, said they used it all the time and loved it."
5,"Anytime I have started to get even the slightest sore throat, I drink this and the next morning it's gone. I always bought it at World Market, but they said it has been discontinued. But, thank God for Amazon!"
5,This tea is so helpful for congestion and it tastes great too.  Make sure you let it steep as long as the directions say.  It really seems to help you to feel better.
5,"In cold weather, I brew this tea by the pot, keep it simmering, and brew a lemon ginger or ginger lemon tea, by the cup, made with this as the base.  My husband will drink it, and I can't get him to use any other medicinal.  (Hates licorise.)  It helped a great deal last winter."
5,"Have bought this from the folks who prepare it and I must say, this is the absolute best item I have ever tasted. They make this at a farm in Benson, AZ and it tastes like heaven. Highly recommend it for everything...I tend to slice up apples and dip them. Have tried it on toast as well."
4,"This is an excellent training treat for every day.  It's not a ""high value"" treat (used for more challenging training situations) nor is it so bland that it does not serve as an incentive.  It's a good size, though it does make some crumbs.  Plus, ""liver biscotti"" is fun to say!"
5,"Our dog loves these treats.  We sprinkle a few into his regular dry dog food, and he gobbles everything up as fast as he can.  We also use them as rewards for good behavior.  Wonderful, nutritious, really good to have on hand at all times."
5,"Lucy loves these treats as does her friend, Daisy - I do not know what else to say to fill up the 210 word minimum."
5,My dog will do anything for these treats. Buying a five pound bag lasts about a year and they are dry so they are easy to put in your pocket and they last forever.
5,"Our dog named ""Big Red"" loves your liver biscoti and the closest store was 54 miles round trip. I am not too keen on driving that far so I found your mail service on the internet. Now our 8 pound poodle gets his treats again!"
5,They're perfect training treats for my dogs.  They go to the place where they're stored and stand there until I get a handful for our play games.
5,even my vet approves. these little treats are my dogs favorite. i just get the small ones because i have a small dog.
5,My dogs go crazy over Liver Biscottis. They are nice and crunchy which helps clean their teeth and all the ingredients are wholesome.
5,My dog would have to stop breathing before she would fail to perform for Liver Biscotti. Even my friends with finicky dogs are surprised how their dogs love the stuff.
5,"If there is one thing our dog likes, it is the liver biscotti dog treats.  These make the best rewards and training treats we have used."
5,Our Portuguese Water Dog has been trained on these bite sized little treats. He loves them and will do anything for them.  Good Dog!
5,Our four dogs love this stuff! This bite size treat is a perfect size for training. The dogs like the crunch - it's shaped like a small square crouton. There is enough in this huge bag to make little gift bags for friends with dogs.
5,"A fantastic product for pet treats,great smell and has freeze-dried liver treats beat by leaps and bounds. Owner of 2 fussy cockers."
5,"OMG these things are delicious!@ I'm not a candy/sweets eater usually.. but ... OhMan! I liked them so much I may have had , two.. oops, now three!"
5,"i used to eat beer nuts all the time as a kid.  sorta like honey roasted peanuts, but more unique flavor.  if you never tried'em, if you like honey roasted peanuts, you'll love these!"
5,"great product! wish they were still available in bars,pubs,and stores.have given cans to several of my golf buddies and they agree with me. i'm just glad they are still available on line."
5,Some reviewers must have a short memory. I've been eating Beer Nuts since childhood and the ones I ordered tasted like they always have (sweet and salty). Bought them locally until I couldn't find them anymore. Great product and price for 6/12oz cans.
5,My husband is a Beer Nut lover. Looked in many stores<br />and could only find small bags. Love these large cans.
5,"Not always available at our local stores. I love them. They are especially good watching football games, with you favorite malt beverage. This is a good deal, and super fast delivery, too. The nuts were fresh and tasty, as always."
5,"These are the long time classic.  Not as sweet as honey roasted peanuts, these have just the right balance to go with a nice cold brew.  Amazon's price on these is really great."
1,"The flavor of the old Beer Nuts is almost entirely gone. The Beer Nuts are now just plain Spanish Peanuts with a slight flavor, hardly noticeable. Extremely disappointing."
5,"This is the good stuff! I am eating some right now with some sweet basil tomato sauce. This pasta has a neat shape and it cooks up nicely. It's colorful and tasty and is great ""al dente""."
5,"All of the Castellana pastas are absolutely wonderful.  They have a great taste, hold their unique shapes, grab lots of sauce in your dishes, and have a nice ""bite.""  This is a great price for this item!"
5,It's always wonderful to be able to give chocolates as a gift and to receive them.  It's great to know that you can send someone  some chocolates with the guarantee that they don't arrive all melted.  Good Service and Excellent chocolates!
5,We love strawberries dipped in chocolate but locally we could not find the dark chocolate type - so glad we found this at Amazon - it is WONDERFUL!
5,"Best dipping chocolate ever! I dipped strawberries, pretzels marshmallows its wonderful. My whole family loves them. Great to bring out to friends or occasions! Dont forget the wax paper, otherwise it will stick to your plate!"
5,I have tried a couple of different cocao powders but this one is a step above the other ones.  The richness of the bean has a dark smooth flavor within the powder.  It is just a better product
5,"Almost identical to Ghiradeli's great chocolate taste...but raw!organic! The best!!! I also whip it into whipped up sprouted almonds with Strvia and make ball/snacks from it, yummmm"
5,"This powder, and this company, are both superb. There was a small problem with the order and they handled it in such a gracious manner that I will be a customer forever."
5,"This is a very tasty cacao powder.  It arrived in an unmarked bag (does not have an organic symbol or product description) but it seems to be the real deal.  Good flavor, similar to or better than name brand powders I have purchased in the past.  Will definitely purchase again."
5,bought as gift for hard to buy for father...he LOVED  bread said it was delicious !!
5,WONDERFUL PRODUCT.<br /><br />ALL THE BREAD MIXES I HAVE TRIED ON AMAZON ARE NOT DISAPPOINTING!!!<br /><br />WILL BE BACK FOR MORE.  THEY WILL MAKE GREAT CHRISTMAS PRESENTS.
5,"Love this, dont use too much because it is strong, but it tastes great.  Makes even mediocre salmon taste great."
5,"These are thin,crisp, fragrant cookies and are very delicious and tasty. They are excellent with a glass of cold almond milk or hot herbal tea. (my choices) If you like ginger snaps you will love Lars ginger snaps."
5,These ginger cookies are it...I don't have to look anymore ...I have found THE cookie ...I ate the entire box and did not share...so hubby said when I order more I have to get 2 boxes cause he would like to have some..:)
5,"Very good.  Very tasty and authentic flavor!  I ordered these last minute for Christmas, not knowing if they were going to arrive on time.  They arrived at my house on Christmas Eve."
5,"Didn't have time to make these this year so I thought I would buy them. I never buy cookies, but these I would buy again. My son loved them. The only thing I had to do was dip them in white chocolate.<br />Thanks"
5,This licorice has very good taste.  My daughter is on a gluten free diet and she loves these cherry bites.
3,Maybe these a better when they're very fresh.  You could ruin dental work if not careful chewing these.  They taste great.
4,"Gluten Free foods tend to be extremely expensive when compared to ""regular"" foods. This licorice follows that trend. For the times when you'd like to treat yourself, Candy Tree Organic Licorice is a tasty and safe treat for Gluten Intolerant people. Amazon seems to have the best prices on it too."
5,"If I had not purchased this salad dressing myself, I never would have guessed it was fat free. Served it with fresh vegetables during Thanksgiving pre-dinner, and it was a definite hit with the guests too."
5,"Like the flavor and it's thick, unlike some fat free dressings that are really runny."
5,"<a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000ODRY9I"">Wish Bone Fat Free Ranch Salad Dressing, 16-Ounce Bottle (Pack of 6)</a><br /><br />This is a great salad dressing...tastes just as good and is as flavorful as the regular 'fatfull' dressing."
5,The price is pretty good given that local stores sell one bottle for almost $4. Don't know why the price on this has gone up though.
5,My doc has strictly limited me on what I can and cannot eat. I can use this salad dressing and was pleased to find it in bulk at a great price. Good taste.
5,WANT TO TASTE SOMETHING DIFFERENT?  THEN YOU ARE COMING TO THE RIGHT PLACE.  I JUST LOVE THE SMOOTHNESS  AND FLAVOR OF THE RANCH DRESSINGNOW GET ON YOUR HORSES (OR MULES) AND ORDER SOME TODAY.
5,"If you like jasmine tea, This is a great tea! Its lite not, overly medicine tasting like jasmine tea can be. Its also fun to watch the tea leaves unfurl... I steep it so many times that until I lost count.. haha. Just Great ."
5,We received a box of these at work and the whole package was gone moments after opening it up!  Great biscuits and now I am ordering a couple boxes for a few gifts for people I can't figure out what to get...
5,"Of all the flavors of tic tacs, these are my favorite.  Great wild cherry flavor. Love them!! Too bad they aren't more readily available to purchase locally."
5,"These little buggers are tough to find so I was happy to get a big pack at a good price online.  My daughter is content with these as a reward for doing something well and at 2 calories a piece, not all that unhealthy."
5,Definitely would reorder these again.  I think it would be better if they were offered in a bigger pack.  My kids love these.  Great little Valentine's Day gifts.  Great stocking stuffers.
5,"I bought them for a friend because she loves the cherry ones and they're hard to find. I kept half for myself. I admit, gone in no time."
5,"Everyone knows what a Tic Tac is, but let me tell you something; if you like orange tic tac's, you're going to LOVE wild cherry tic tacs!  Very cherry flavored with just enough of a mix of sweet and sour.  Do yourself a favor and try some."
5,I love these Wild Cherry Tic Tacs and they are impossible to find in stores.  I am so glad that I can get them from Amazon and the price is excellent!  They are a great low calorie treat and I will keep buying them from Amazon.  Highly recommend this purchase!
4,I low orange tictacs and after reading reviews I decided to try these and there almost just as good. Orange is still my favorite but cherry is pretty close
5,"These are one of my favorite flavors of tic tacs.  The flavor is a true sour cherry and quite intense.  You really get a lot of flavor out of one 2-calorie treat, which can satisfy for quite a while!"
5,great thanks for the great service i don't know what else to say i have said all i have tu say.
4,"Since husband quit smoking many many yrs ago, he took up the tic-tac habit with cinnamon tic-tacs.  they no longer make cinnamon so he has tried the wild cherry and they are OK."
5,Very nice product<br />full of quality items - not the cheap candies like other baskets
5,Were just what my wife wanted and she loves them. Next she will get the other type of bar by the same vendor.
5,"I love sorghum flour.  It's mild in flavor and smell, it's easily mixed into flour blends for gluten free baking too.  It's one of my favorites along with millet, sweet rice, coconut and almond."
5,My sister is alergic to wheat so I make her a lot of Gluten Free foods.  I searched local stores and could not find Sorghum Flour.  So I looked on Amazon and finally found it.  It was all packed wonderfully and arrived perfectly fine and I'm already using it.
5,I am a big fan of Sorghum flour for my baked goods. It gives everything a bit of sponge (especially cakes) and adds an extra bit of sweet to the baking. I highly recommend this for baking flour mixes - you may not want to add it to savory recipes though because of the light sweet flavor.
5,Great product!<br /><br />The Stevia powder will not raise your blood glucose level and it is all natural.<br /><br />Use very sparingly since it is much sweeter than sugar.<br /><br />Tastes more natural than artifical sweeteners and is healthy to use since it is an organic natural sweetener.
5,This is the best tasting stevia powder I've tried. Most other powders have a weird after taste but this one doesn't. I recently bought a 5lb bag of it online and I'm making my way through it.
5,This has been the best tasting Stevia I have tried.  I also think this is a better value than some of the others.  I really like not having to open all the packets when I make a gallon of Tea.
3,Maybe my tastebuds are different but I bought this at a local healthfood store and I'm not completely sold on it.  I tried it in my tea and it did leave me w/ an aftertaste...just like most sweetners. *shrugs*
5,"I hated Stevia and it's licorice taste until I tried Nustevia.  Since that day, I have almost completely eliminated sugar in my drinks.  I like that it is a plant based product and not bio-engineered.  No after-taste and you need very little to make anything taste sweet."
5,"If you are trying to get off sugar, this is the product for you. I has a great sweet taste without spiking your insulin, and no bitter aftertaste.  Great for diabetics and anyone trying to eat healthy.  I love this product."
5,If you need to cut down on sugar this is the way to go! I love Stevia in my iced tea and it's great on your cereal also. Great stuff!!
5,"I was looking for a healthier alternative to Splenda and Equal, NuStevia taste great and this container lasts a long time."
5,I love this stevia! I have tried MANY different kinds over the years and this one is my FAVE! Goes great in my coffee and tea. I have this one on auto ship and get one a month (makes it pretty cheap too!)
5,"this stevia is the best tasting we've ever tried. it also mixes into beverages more thoroughly than some others.the service from this buyer was prompt, the product arrived on time and in excellent condition. would order from them again, and recommend them to others.Linda blyth"
5,"I ordered this after having much success with their liquid products. It is not bitter at all and has a very fresh/clean taste to it.  I have baked with it, used it on the stove, and in my oatmeal and hot cocoa.  When I run out, I'll be ordering more!"
5,"Very happy with the product.... in a taste test, for the price, it ranks very high.  Delivery was prompt and as expected."
5,"Love this on a toasted bagel with cream cheese and scallions or even dill, great way to enjoy caviar and not break the bank."
5,"Roland Red lumpfish Caviar is excellent.The price is good and affordable,it makes a good presentation for company, and tastes very good. I purchased many items from Amazon, even large ticket items, and I am very satisfied with the products and service."
3,"This stuff isn't bad at all. But you know how you can just eat spoon after spoon of really good caviar without toast points or crackers or anything? This roe is more for sprinkling over fish dishes, morning eggs or a caesar salad. All in all, for the price, it's pretty good,"
3,"I use red lumpfish caviar in a couple of dishes, and this brand is as good as any I've found, though the red coloring is perhaps a little much!"
1,I ordered this for gifts around Christmas time. I actually was hoping to use it for our Christmas day meal. Two out of the four jars I ordered were rotten and inedible. I never did get to try it and I was very annoyed and disappointed!
2,"This stuff sounded perfect...way too much red dye and no taste according to me and my 3 friends who tried it...kind of salty.  Basically, I would stay away from it.  I am tempted to toss it out, but paid too much to feel right about it..."
5,This is a joy to serve on my mini potato pancakes  with sour cream and then a teaspoon of this caviar on top. Soooooo tasty and pretty for Christmas. Thanks for offering it.
2,Caviar taste awful. Maybe it's because I bought from a cheaper brand or maybe because cavier is just bad no matter who you buy it from or how much you paid for it? Why do people like to waste money on these things?
5,"All of the Roland products are top quality.  Roland's caviar is the real deal, unlike some other brands that are really made from seaweed!"
5,if u have not tried this u r missing the best thing u could cook for your family.I give this 10 stars.
5,"Cooked in healthy coconut oil that's why it stays crunchy! Will not give you side effects of vegetable oil - oxidized cholesterol, transfats, rancidity, and free radicals when you eat foods fried in canola soybean or corn oil."
4,These are a cheap alternative for summer when everyone wants a cold treat. Superior flavor and size than the Fla-Vor-Ice case.
5,"This  coffee is the smoothest dark roast coffee I have ever tasted,and it was a pleasure to sip this full bodied coffee before breakfast and after dinner."
5,This coffee is delicious. It is full bodied and leaves a great almost chocolaty after taste. My dad told me about it after a trip to Costa Rica.
5,Great tasting coffiee!! One of the best I've ever had! The problem here is the high shipping costs.
5,My husband and I fell in love with Cafe Britt coffee while we were in Costa Rica.  Upon our return we were delighted to see that we could order it through amazon.com!  The coffee is easy to drink - not bitter or harsh and is a great way to start your day.  Highly recommended.
4,"I used to use this coffee after we visited Costa Rica and gave some to my aunt.  She thinks it is the best coffee there is, so I gave her some for Christmas.  It is excellent."
4,"i purchased this item for a cake that called for gold dust, never thought i would find it, but im glad i did. when i sprinkled it on it looked  like a shining star. the container is small but it will go a long way. worth buying."
5,"This product allows me to make some really big splashes when providing spiced nuts at gatherings.  The fact that the gold spreads so easily allows me to use just a little but ""show off""  People are amazed that this is edible gold"
1,"i found this product doing a search for ""edible gold leaf."" i decided to purchase after reading rave reviews about food items that were created using it. HOWEVER.. it is clearly marked ""NOT to be consumed"" and ""for decorative use only."" so this is a misleading product."
5,I subscribe to several Hormel Compleats. This is definitely the best flavored dinner I have tried.  I am planning to double my subscription.
4,Not so sure about this product. Chicken and Rice is not really what there is. Sure there is some chicken and some rice but mostly gravy. All in all I still like it.
3,"Not bad, but like others say a bit too salty. I do notice a strange after taste, tho. I like Boyardee's better. And won't buy this again."
5,"These dinners are as close to perfect as can be found here in the mountains.  Quick, easy and delicious!"
4,A bit dry but still good. They may be perfectly all right; I just thought the noodles were hard and dry.<br />I'm still enjoying them.
2,"the taste isn't good, at least isn't good for Japanese and Chinese.<br />Its taste is basically sort of American Japanese taste.<br />Plus the price isn't competitive.<br /><br />I'd suggest Asians never buy it."
5,"With this spice mix, you can recreate the taste of your favorite restaurant stews.  It is potent, so do not use too much. It smells heavenly. Perfect for both meat and bean stews."
5,This is a very tasty item. My wife doesn't eat meat and had to stay<br />in a hotel for 4 weeks during a training she attended. I had this shipped<br />to her and she raved about the great flavor and wanted more!
4,These are super tastey! I would definitely recommend. The only reason I'm not giving 5 stars is because I wish they were bigger! :D
5,"Super tasty quick meal.  It's a bit small, but perfect for a lunch on the go.  Definitely not going to help you with any dinner hunger pangs though.<br /><br />The sodium is a little higher than I'd like, but I really can't beat it for economic and efficient lunchfood."
3,"I like the concept, and I like Asian food, but the ""roasted peanut noodle"" variety of this McDougall's entree doesn't have enough peanut flavor for me.  Sauce is rather thin, too, and the flavor's fine--just not sure I could identify it as peanut.  I'll try a different variety next time, I think."
3,"Tastes great. Price is okay. Received in timely manner, but two of the soup packages were bent. Hope the price comes down."
3,"first time I've tried this item, it's just ok, the broth is tasty but the noodles are pretty bland to me"
2,The noodles for this product are what make me gag.  I am not a fan of this meal at all and I &lt;3 Asian food.  For those looking for a delicious snack who are not already 100% vegan - I would either A) go try 1 first or B) skip buying this package as it is not delicious.
5,"These papers are great, they leave a delicious strawberry taste on your lips. Even the glue tastes good."
5,These rolling papers are great they taste amazing and they burn slow and also prevent tar from running down the paper
1,"This coffee supposedly is premium, it tastes watery--very thin.  Not good at all.  Maybe old??<br />Not sure, it was a waste, and I'm using it line the bottom of my sitting shoes and trash cans and rained-on luggage, to absorb the smells.  So I used it, but not to drink.  Do not buy."
5,"Excellent. Very nice, rich and creamy with the pistachio nut in the middle. mmmm.....  Delish!!!"
5,"If you want a good quick cooked sauce without excess acidity these are the ones to use. The real San Marzano, beware of imitators!"
3,"My sister and I did a blind taste test with these to see if the price was worth it, and we couldn't tell the difference between these and the two other brands I had on hand. I wouldn't buy them again."
5,These jelly beans are wonderful.  They are smaller than regular jelly beans but that doesn't take away the flavor.  I would recommand these to anyone.
1,I never got the product and complained about the non receipt.  so i bought some in the store. klefje lskejfewl lsfjewldf
5,"Soy milk is scrumptious and this variety has some extra nutrients added. It's a great, nutritious, high-calcium, no cholesterol product at a great price. Buy a case."
2,makes nasty loose poo! the dry food does the same thing. i've tried the adult version and the puppy version and both gave my adult dog and my puppy super soft and stinky stools.
4,This product is very good.  It goes a long way.  But quite as good as the one at DD.  Good product not the less.
3,"I am a big fan of most of the freeze dried fruit and veggies, they are crunchy and flavorful and have NOTHING added.  The tomato fragments are extremely dry and tough, more like old sun dried, and for me they are only good when used in cooked dishes.  I do appreciate that these are organic!"
4,"I absolutely LOVE the just tomatoes tomatoe slices. I thought the bits might be good for soups etc., but they don't seem to have the same sweet flavor of the slices. I will ues these up, but go back to the slices. On the whole, a great product."
5,"I toss some of these in soups, or hydrate in a bit of hot water and add to salads or salad dressings. They add a nice somewhat meaty flavor, (almost like bacon bits but healthy), to almost any dish."
5,You can find this 6-pack for $40 dollars less at diapers.com.  No reason they should be charging this much.
5,"I eat this pasta every day, without guilt. I love this pasta. I maintain my desired weight without any problem. You have to cook this pasta a little longer than normal pasta, but it is every bit as good."
5,I love this stuff and only get it through Amazon.  It arrived on time and good condition and I enjoy it.
5,"Love this pasta.  I mix this with regular pasta for a meal, half and half.  Love the lower calories and the fiber content."
5,"Love this pasta.  Does cook up a little firm, cooked it a bit longer. Had it with pesto very good.  My husband could not tell the difference so I know it is good.  He is very fussy."
5,I don't know how they do it but this product is too good to be true.  Half the calories of regular pasta!! Wow.
5,Great product.  Recommended by Dr. Oz.  We love pasta but not the calories.  This is much better than whole wheat.
5,I brought a box with me to visit my daughter and family.<br />We all enjoyedjthe fiber gourmet light penne  very much.
3,It is a good tasting product.It does not raise my blood sugar as much as regular pasta but you still can't eat a whole box and expect your glucose levels will be normal.
4,"I am enjoying this coffee but the vanilla is a little overpowering.  The strength of the coffee itself is very good.  I can use one packet to make 2- 4 oz. cups with the Senseo coffee maker so it definitely saves me money.  Plus, it is just so easy to make coffee and clean up in the morning!"
5,So many different flavors to choose from.  I ordered this brand for the first time and the taste is wonderful.  It was the only decaf french vanilla I could find.  I have decided to switch from my old brand to this one.
5,"This by far the best pudding mix, you don't see this on the store shelves.. Everyone seems to just buy milk chocolate pudding.. and I guess most don't like to cook pudding on the stove, it is best when pudding is cooked cooked.. Instant pudding does not equal this..  Carl"
5,We've been searching everywhere locally for this putting.  I was so elated to find it on Amazon.  This is the only pudding my mother made her chocolate pies with and now the tradition continues.  Thank you so much Amazon!!!
1,how come you sent me instant choc.fudge pudding...<br />the order told you to send me the COOK & SERVE choc.fudge pudding....<br />you show the picture of it....<br />why couldn't send it to me....<br />it makes me wonder if I should order anything else from you....<br />pissed
5,"I brought 2 bottles.  One I carry in my pocket and the other for home.  I fell in love with this while on vacation in Belize.  Just a couple drops does the trick.  Packs a ton of flavor, but not too hot that it overpowers your food."
4,"Good product and decent shipping. However, the price was $15.95 and I later found the same item in a local store for $6.95. What a gouge."
3,It's like eating a large box of paste.  I enjoy the flavor but I usually cook them and then mix with something else I'm eating as it's a no-go straight out of the box!
2,"I simply don't like it. It is easy to prepare, but when I eat it, I feel that i am eatting a lot of artificial ingredients. I cannot even finish one fourth of it....."
3,"Overall, this was good, but not great.  The ginger sauce seemed like it need an extra something to get it a fourth star.  I think I was expecting a little more ginger taste.  I'd buy it again, especially if I can find a good way to punch it up just a little more.  I may try that egg tip!"
5,I really like this soup.  It is mild and I don't like anything that is to hot.  IT is just right.  Has a good flavor and is something I can take to work and pop in the microwave. I would buy it again and again.
5,"This is quick, easy and portable, and I think it tastes great! It's my favorite flavor."
2,"Thanks for the egg tip, it works very well and really helps this product.  Nevertheless, I ended up giving away three of the six containers because I was not thrilled with the nutritional information."
4,"It's very tasty and very easy to make.  If you're in need of a very quick, filling meal and it needs to be gluten free, this works out great.  Try the Thai Peanut one, too."
4,Very tasty gluten-free option.  My kids loved it as it wasn't too spicy.
4,The Thai Coconut Ginger Noodles are quick and easy to prepare. You will be rewarded with delicious noodles to enjoy by yourself or share as a side dish with another noodle enjoyer.
5,I liked this so much that I re-ordered and will keep<br /><br />re-ordering.
1,I bought these for my son to take to work for lunch. Apparently his co-workers found the smell so offensive they asked him not to eat it at work again. Maybe it was a bad batch...
3,"I don't plan on reordering it, but it was definitely edible and filling since I added chicken."
5,"This is a great and delicious way to eat Thia food at home.  Just ""melt"" the entire packet (if you like it spicy) into two cans of coconut milk in a pan.  Then add your favorite meat and veggies.  I usually use chicken strips and a bag of frozen asian veggies."
5,Much hotter than your normal green curry. One pack makes many servings.
5,"Second order.  Very good, hot which I like but best to sample as per your preferences."
5,"I was really impressed with this.  There are many flavors, and quite a bit of heat.  With this and your favorite brand of cocunut milk you can make some great Thai curries at home."
5,This stuff rocks!!! I've had it at two different spas and I just love it. It's tart and really unusual. A real treat.
5,This is my husband's new favorite tea! I'm not huge on hibiscus but this does taste good. I'm sure we'll be buying more.
5,Nice tea. I can steep up too 3 times. It has a strong cranberry flavor. Probably would be good as a cold tea. I recommend if you LOVE cranberry.
5,"Love it, love it, love it!  Both me and my 10 year old drink this herbal tea quite often.  Very tasty!"
5,This is very good tea in an elegant sachet. A little pricier than some but produces a wonderful flavor whether you're drinking it hot or cold.
5,Had been feeding my 3 hounds Purina One (which they liked) and thought I'd try this since it's not much more and I liked the ingredients. They LOVE it and I plan to order more in the future!
5,"When I purchased the Harmony Farms Healthy Weight Formula, I had a Mini Dachshund and Jack Russel Terrier.  Both of them love it.  I have added a Shih Tzu to my pack and she loves it, also.  I would highly recommend it to others.  The kibble is just the right size for small dogs."
5,"I am very pleased with this dog food. My sheltie has a good coat and good movements with Harmony Farms. Does much better with this food than others. He is a very picky eater, so I do add chicken and he will eat. We will stick with Harmony Farms. I also like the bag, it helps keep the food fresh."
5,"My dog loves this food, and she has maintained her healthy weight for many years.  The vet is very happy with her general health, coat, and teeth.  Having the 16lb bag sent directly to my home without any shipping charges is terrific!  The 16 lb. size is not available in my area."
5,"My dog loves, loves  this dog food.I had to say love twice, because this dog food is one of his dog's favorite."
5,"This dog food satisfies both of my dogs and they have had no digestion problems or skin issues , as they have had with other brands.  They both have maintained healthy weights and glossy coats on this food. I have been very pleased with the automated delivery service."
1,I read the reviews on this and thought id get some for my dog and pup.<br />They will not touch it. Even if I mix it with home cooked food.<br /><br />They like the dollar store dog food better than this.<br /><br />Amazon let me down on even allowing this dog food to be sold under their name.
5,"These chips are wonderful.  My kids and I all loved the salt and pepper.<br />Each .8 oz bag was 100 calories, lots of chips for the calorie count."
5,"Great packaging, and item is just as described. Will purchase this item again. They were shipped very fast, and efficient."
4,I really liked these chips as did my entire family. I wish you could pick and choose the flavors in the variety pack. I would love to try the sweet potato and chili lime and leave the salt and pepper behind.
3,These popchips were something I wanted to try because they were baked. The barbeque ones were okay but the rest of them were terrible.
5,"These tastes good. If it's not fried, not bad for you, and tastes good, then why not eat them? Of course, not a lot at once, but these are great healthier snacks."
5,I like these chips a lot! Now i have a whole 24 pack ! this is how i get my chips on while i Fish!
4,"Good flavorful chips - too bad the selection does not include jalape&ntilde;o or paramsan garlic. Packaging is difficult to open, but they fresh."
5,"I got these for my gf as she isn't supposed to eat any gluten.  All of the flavors taste great and they seem to be much healthier than regular potato chips.  If you are looking for a gluten-free snack, I highly recommend Popchips!"
4,"I like all the varieties except the salt and pepper.  They taste too much like black pepper and nothing else.  The others are very goodl<a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001RVFDOO"">Popchips 6-Flavor Variety Pack, 0.8-Ounce Single Serve Bags (Pack of 24)</a>"
5,"The products are wonderful and fresh!!  Everything reported about the chips is on target, and I would recommend them to others.  Amazon's services are fantastic!!"
5,"These are really good tasting chips, they aren't too unhealthy so you can eat a fair amount. Love the flavoring."
5,"I wasn't sure about these chips, but thought I would give them a try. These are tasty, crispy chips - and only 100 calories a bag! I like all the flavors included in the variety pack. I definitely will buy again."
5,"These chips are very tasty,  Its a nice size serving and only 100 calories.  Good grab and go snack for busy Moms"
4,"The PopChips were great and they were fresh when they arrived. For the price, I wish there were more bags of chips for my bucks."
5,Aboulutely love Popchips!I first tried these healthy chips at a marathon i did in California. I like this variety pack because i got to try alot of the flavors ive never had.
5,This product was everything and more according to the advertisement.  I was totally satisfied with my purchase.  I recommend to everyone to purchase these chips from this site.
5,Popchips is a new product for me--ordered after seeing an ad in Weight Watchers magazine.  Loved the product.  Packing was perfect.  Shipping went fine.  No complaints with this order at all.  Probably will order again soon!
4,The product is exactly what it is portrayed to be. Tasty (not yummy) but good. I received the product promptly. I ordered 2 cases and will eat every package.
5,"I love these chips, they taste so good I am on a low cal diet and they are perfect. The individual bags keep you honest. Thank you PopChips"
5,These are delicious.  My husband and I just love them.  Especially the BBQ and Salt and Vinegar flavors.  I like the individual packages.  It's a wonderful bargain when you get free shipping!
5,These are the best snacks for me as I am a lap band patient.  They fill u up just enough and the small bags are perfect size
5,A dream for those on Weight Watchers who love potato chips. The individual serving bags of Pop Chips are only 3 points and taste delicious.
5,These are a Great size and healthy.  They satisfy the craving for something crisp and are reasonable calorie wise.
5,These chips are GREAT substitute for the usual high calorie ones offered!  I keep them on hand to aid in my weight loss venture.
5,"I am on weight watchers and these chips are only 3 points and they taste GREAT.  I like every kind,  I use the plain chips to dip with my salsa.  I would recomend these chips to everyone weight watchers or not."
3,Definitely better than Pirate Booty and slightly better than Baked chips. Very tasty but you feel as if you're almost eat something with the same texture as cereal. It's a small payoff to enjoy chips (albeit faux chips). The Vinegar and S/P ones are NASTY!
5,The BBQ chips are great.  We liked them better than regular chips.  They have a nice crunch.  Hate Kettle chips which are so hard that they are like eating shards of glass.<br /><br />We will definitely be buying more of the Popchips.
5,"Found these while looking for good, cheap, low-calorie snack packs to buy in bulk for my office.  After my first shipment, I decided to have two boxes shipped to the office monthly via subscribe & save.  My next shipment arrives in two days. I'm so excited!<br /><br />Gotta have my pop chips..."
5,My husband and I both really like the popchips.  They are a great substitute for regular potato chips and we both find them very satisfying.
5,What a great way to help with dieting and keeping on track.  These are very tasty and crunchy - great with sandwiches or salad or even by themselves.
5,"My whole family loves these ""chips"".  I am following the Weight Watchers plan and the whole bag is only 3 points, there is quite a few in the bag totally worth it!!!"
5,"Popchips are a great guilt-free way to add some crunchy satisfaction to your diet without added excess fat and sugar. They are clean, light, deliciously satisfying and are available in a variety of flavors.They would make a great lunch box addition. Popchips will be on hand in our home from now on!"
5,I received my box of assorted Popchips a few days ago to support my Weight Watcher meal plan.  I absolutely love them and find that they fit in with my plan.  Without hesitation I recommend all varieties of these chips.  What a great idea!!!
2,"Very tasty chips( ORIGINAL AND OTHER FLAVORS ),but ones with salt flavor way too salty.Not sure who likes so much salt in chips.."
5,We absolutely loved the chips and after ordering them from Amazon we were able to find them in Target.  They have a really good flavor and we would eat them even if we weren't trying to loose weight.  Recommended by weight watchers.
5,"Popchips are absolutely delicious, and getting the variety pack is great.  Everyone in my family has a favorite flavor.  Highly recommend these as they feed your chip craving, but are not nearly as bad for you as chips."
4,I really like the flavors and the fact that the chips are low in fat.  I especially like the bbq and salt and vinegar.  I don't care for the salt and pepper.  I wish I could get a multipack and choose the flavors I want.
5,We have played this with three adults.  fun game that does not take too long to play.  makes you think and plan only to have someone else mess up your plans.
5,That's all I can say. Yum at a great price! I can't find these sizes anywhere in my local grocery so this is just awesome.
5,"Great low cal snack... satisfies the crunchy, snacky, salty cravings without high calories.  All flavors are good;  The cheddar is a little too seasoned for my taste."
5,"I have a free sampling of these chips and I can see me swapping them for my regular chip cravings. They remind me of Munchos, but are less greasy. Try them."
5,If you haven't discovered Pop Chips yet - you don't know what you are missing.  Low calorie and high in flavor.  Great for the kids lunches. I need the single servings or I will eat the whole big bag.
5,"These have become a wonderful alternative to those afternoon cravings for salt, and or sugar.  They have texture and flavor, and a bag hits the spot.  I would highly recommend these if you are looking for an alternative to the junk from candy machines."
5,"I am a chip fanatic, when I heard of these, I HAD to give them a try! They are very tasteful esp. the bbq one's.  I have yet to try the other flavors but I am sure they will not disappoint.  I watch my weight/health so these are perfect, just becareful because they are addicting!"
4,"Good Variety of the flavors, makes it helpful to sample for your choice of type you prefer. Also good for packed lunches or as a portioned snack."
5,This is a great snack to have instead of potato chips. Lower in calories but still delicious. Will be ordering them again.
5,I love Popchips. They are delicious and I can't believe one bag is only 100 calories. The flavors are great although I am not a fan of salt and pepper. I would highy recommend as a way to try the different flavors. I am sure you will love them too.
5,"I'm trying to eat healthier and one of the things I really love is chips and salty snacks of all kinds!  These Popchips really do the trick of satisfying my craving. Though I don't really care for the pepper flavor, I like all of the others.  I will buy these again."
4,I found these chips on vacation in Oregon.  The store was a kind of natural yet upscale type of grocery store.  I had never seen them before.  They are different than regular chips-no oily taste but very flavorful.  I didn't know if I could get them in CA so I ordered a case!
5,"These taste great and are a healthier alternative. My favorite was the sea salt and vinegar. I probably won't order the other flavors again since I have a favorite, and don't eat potato chips all that often. But the variety pack was great to get to try them all."
5,These chips are flavorful without all the fat of fried. I love love the bbq flavor.  I also like how the chips don't crumble in the bag.
4,These are great little snack packs - flavorful chips and fairly low fat and low cal.
4,"I tried this chips in a hotel that I stayed at, and loved them! I ordered them for the office and everyone enjoyed them. I'm on my second order!"
5,Popchips are very good.  The varity received lets you try the diferent flavors.  I only wish I could find them locally.
5,"These are the best chips invented for those who are trying to watch their calorie intake.  You get a lot of chips for minimal calories, and they taste great!!"
5,"Great selection of chips & very fresh. If you are are looking for a healthy alternative to fried potato chips & don't like the fake taste of baked, these are just the most amazing chips you can eat. I bought 2 cases & every time I'm at Target or our Super Box Store I make sure to pick them up!!"
5,The chips are very good and serve as a great snack with very low calories and Weight Watcher point value.
5,"We tried these chips because DR. OZ had recommended them on his show as a healthier potato chip alternative.  My whole family loves them, we have not found a flavor that we don't like.  These are WAY better than any baked style chip.  Try them and you won't be disappointed!"
5,"These chips are pretty delicious.. Even the original flavor with nothing on it is good. It's not as delicious as Doritos, but it's also not fried either, which definitely balances it out. A good snack for all times of day!"
5,MY kids loved these and they were such a great deal. I didn't feel so guilty about giving my kids chips!!
5,Everyone should try these chips. They are healthier than regular chips. And they taste good.
5,"These are the best alternative chips I have ever tried. I have shared them with friends and relatives and they all agree. You get enough in the single serve packs to be truly satisfied and if you are a weight watchers customer, they are GREAT, only 2 points for each bag!!!"
4,Possibly THE best salt and vinegar chips (healthy or not) ever!  The salt is just right and compliment the vinegar's tartness perfectly.<br /><br />All the chips are good.. salt and pepper can be a little overwhelming.
5,The popchips are a nice alternative to potato chips. They are not greasy and only 100 calories per bag. Great for dieters. Fits in with a low calorie diet. Definitely would recommend trying at least once.
5,Totally amazing and very delicious.<br /><br />My favorite flavors (from best to worst):<br /><br />1. barbecue<br />2. sour cream and onion<br />3. cheddar<br /><br />4. salt and pepper<br />5. original<br />6.  vinegar and sea salt
5,Salt and Vinegar and BBQ rock!  Plain were OK....Didn't really care for Cheddar.  Nice to start w/a variety pack to find the ones you prefer.
5,"I am very pleased with these.  Note: they are kosher (kof k) Pareve!  At 100 calories / bag, they make a delicious snack."
5,Excellent taste for a low calorie snack.  This size bag is exactly 100 calories and you get a lot of chips.  I prefer these to the regular greasy chips.
5,i love popchips and this was really a treat to get the variety of flavors and the individual bags were such convenience! Thank you!
5,"I absolutely love Pop Chips as a healthy alternative to regular, fatty chips.  The Seat Salt and Pepper and the Sour Cream and Onion are my favorites.  I don't crave regular chips at all!"
5,"I LUV me some POPCHIPS!!  These are great snack items.  I ordered a case, and passed them around my office.  Now everyone is addicted to these chips. I have not found anyone that did not like these chips...and they are healthier than the baked chips out there. YUMM!!"
5,Great product! All the flavors were delicious. Loved the fact that the single serve bags were about 100 calories each.
5,"I LOVE THESE CHIPS, I HAVE THEM ON AUTO ORDER EVERY 2 MONTHS, THEY TASTE GREAT, I CAN NOT BELIVE THE WHOLE BAG HAS 100 CALORIES, I HAVE A BAG EVERY DAY, IT SURE HAS HELPED MY WEIGHT LOSS BY HAVEING THEM IN LITTLE BAGS, SO I DO NOT EAT A HUGE AMOUNT"
5,I am very impressed with the flavors. ALL OF THEM! There were a few flavors I wasn't sure I was going to like....but they are really good also! The flavors are very intense. You are not getting a bland chip. I'm on the monthly plan but I've already had to order them ahead of schedule twice!
5,PopChips are delicious and much healthier than your regular potato chips. I love all the flavors !! It's also nice to get a variety box with single serving bags.
5,Fabulous - tasty but not awful for you!  I've already recommended to folks I work with.  Will continue to purchase!

5,I love these chips...and my husband does too. He wipes them out before I can get to them. The variety pack is a great way to determine which flavor you like. They are packaged well and always fresh. The bag contains a generous portion. I've purchased many times and am never dissapointed.
5,"This is a great chip replacement! Wow all the flavors are terrific,good with a sandwich, soup, or just a late night snack!"
5,Pop Chips are the best chips I've had in a long time.  I'm a Weight Watcher and to satisfy that salty craving I get now and then these chips are the ticket and they are only 2 points.  And when I buy a case of them they average I think about .94.  Not bad.
5,"I am a chip addict and these are by far some of the tastiest, non-homemade chips I've ever had. Plus they're healthy! Only problem is I can't decide which flavor is my favorite."
5,Variety pack of popchips r sooo good all flavors r delicious and r way healthier than regular greasy potato chips....popchips r half the fat and only 100 calories so a def must buy

5,These chips are very good. Wish we could purchase them in our area. Great chance to try them in this offer.
5,"These are better than any low calorie chips I've ever had, and I prefer them to normal chips. They are wonderful. Oprah even loves them.  I would buy this box again, and probably will, because I LOVE that these are 100 calorie packs. The barbeque and salt and vinegar ones are AWESOME."
4,They were not bad tasting...........they served the purpose that I wantned with a sandwich nice and crunchy
5,These chips are delicious and each bag only has 100 calories.  They are not fried but just baked and come in 6 different flavors.  For anyone who is dieting but loves potato chips these are great.
5,These are the best chips ever and what a great swap for all the fat and calories of regular chips.  Not to mention that they come in single servings so when you eat the WHOLE bag it's ok!!!  Great product and I would highly recommend it anyone.
5,These taste wonderful!  Guilt free if you can stop at one bag.  Will definitly buy again!
5,"Love, love, love these crunchy little treats.  They remind me of ""Munchos"" but without the greasy tounge afterwards.  I don't usually like flavored snacks, but these are all great, not overwhelming and no gross aftertaste.  I subscribe to them so I will never run out:)"

3,"I am interested in these but was wondering if someone that has them could post some nutrition info on them? Mainly, fat, fiber, sugars, and then any vitamins? Thanks so much!!"
5,"I shared these with my two older sons, then ordered more. These are great to put in the glove compartment for after work."
3,"I decided to try these based on the reviews - they are pretty good - especially for a more healthy option, but not sure I'll get them again."
1,Two words: potato flakes. Not sure what the buzz about these is. Try one bag before you buy a case. Can't be returned.
5,in my book. You can eat one serving with ease and not feel any remorse. Just wish That there were more BBQ and Cheese flavored selections. The Black pepper is the BESTEST yet.
2,OK...but would never buy them again my husband ate some...<br /><br /> I thought they tasted a lot like the chips they used to call MUNCHO'S!<br /><br /> Just not for me!
2,"I've heard about these chips for a while now and thought they would be a good alternative to regular chips. I couldn't eat them though, they just don't taste good to me personally. My grandmother loved them though and I gave the rest to her."
5,they taste awesome! esp the salt n pepper one! I love them and they are really healthy! the packaging is really good..
5,"These popchips are a great alternative when you need a munchie, crunchie snack. They are much lower in calories/fat than regular chips and are portioned controlled. I especially like the barbeque flavor or the salt and pepper flavored popchips."
5,"Popchips are an excellent snack. I really like all of the varieties. I use Amazon's subscription plan and save some $$  -  I get 1 24-pack box per month, shipped automatically. Life is grand!"
5,"I am enjoying the recent purchase of PopChips, so far I have enjoyed all the flavor choices.  The individual serving bags make it easy for me to have just the right portion serving with my meals or if I have a craving for a snack.  Thanks for the product. Jean Roth"
5,"I'm really glad Amazon carries these, they are so much better for you than regular chips and actually taste good too.  We haven't found a flavor we didn't like yet.  I'll probably use the Amazon subscribe feature to get another $3 off as we will go through these fairly regularly.  Awesome chips!"
5,these are the best chips I have every tasted They are Healthy for4 you & have Great flavor  I will buy often I eat 1 bag a day with my Lunch  Yummy !!!
4,This chips are perfect for a snack without having greasy fingers leftover.  All the flavors are great with my favorite being the vinegar and sea salt.
5,Great Chips - No after taste...<br />Seem to be much better for me.<br />Need to buy the big bags now.
3,"Not anything to rave about. They were okay. I think if I truly had a craving for chips I would just buy and eat ""regular"" ones. Won't buy again."
3,Popchips are good and great for diet snack. But on Amazon the price is nearly double the cost of Costco. An 18 pack is only $7.89 at Costco.
5,I HAPPENED UPON THIS ITEM IN MY LOCAL DELI AND BEING CURIOS I DECIDED TO TRY.  THEY WERE FABULOUS BETTER THAN THE REGULAR CHIPS BY FAR.  I GIVES YOU SATISFACTION OF CRUNCH AND FLAVOR IN A POTATOE CHIP.  GREAT GREAT FIND.
5,The chips are good with fast service but I ordered a case(24) of Popchips 6-flavor Variety Pack and received 24 bags all Barbecue flavored.
3,"I have not ordered yet, my question is, from the description, it is 24 bags at 0.8 ounces. How does this equal 192 ounces in total weight?"
1,"Pop Chips are basically a horribly over-priced version of ""Munchos"" which are baked potato chips and have been around forever. Period."
2,the best flavor in this box is the salt and pepper and the bbq flavor.  all the other flavor was just so-so
3,"I'm not as crazed about these as everyone else, but for a low-calorie snack, they're fine.  They certainly don't do much to curb the appetite though. I'm typically just as hungry after finishing as before - not like with Protein Chips (also available through Amazon)."
3,"The texture is like rice crackers, which I personally don't like. Taste isn't too bad, but every single bags are too salty, even the original flavor. I'd give four stars if they make low sodium chips. The salt.. is one of your worst enemies. I bet it does more harms to your body than MSG's."
2,"These chips are too salty!!!<br />I like the crunch, size of the bags, and variety.<br />But i cannot finish the case due to how salty these chips are."
4,Love these!  I'm not a fan of potato chips but these taste fresh and not at all greasy.  A little like Pringles but much tastier.
5,"I am so happy to have discovered these chips. I hate stealing a phrase from another product, but they melt in your mouth. I have ordered and tried all flavors without disappointment.Just getting ready to place another order for these 100 calorie per bag, air popped chips. Do try them people!"
3,"This seemed like the perfect way to limit my addiction to potato chips. Small, single serving bags.  I really like the plain, unflavored Popchips, but the rest of the flavors had an aftertaste.  I plan to set up Subscribe & Save for just the plain."
5,"Love the chips, nice 100 +/- calorie snack, reminds me of Munchos, but less greasy, flavors are good (salt & vinegar least favorite). And they've started shipping APO--thank you and my family thanks you (so they don't have to get the package and reship!) Made my day."
5,"Wow, these are remarkably tasty chips.  I discovered them through Weight Watchers and like the fact that they are low in calories and fat.<br />But they are high in flavor and umami.<br />I am now a big fan!"
4,"We liked these.  Quite good, even if they're 'healthy' @ 100 calories & 3 whole fat grams a bag. My favorites are the plain, the others are very strong flavored, very zippy!"
5,"It felt weird ordering 24 bags of chips off the internet that I had never even tried before, but I am SO GLAD I DID. They are delicious! I've tried 4 flavors so far & have loved each one. These are a win. :)"
5,We have these suto delivered.  They are a great healthy sub for potato chips and the snack bags are a perfect size.  Great crunch and we enjoy all the flavors.
5,These are my favorite chips! The BBQ and Salt & Pepper are the best!<br /><br />The texture of these things ROCK!<br /><br />All nicely packaged.<br /><br />Gluten free if you care. I don't but some have commented on that.
5,These chips are tasty and low in calorie.  If you are gluten free they are a great option as a to-go snack.  We love them.
5,The product arrived quickly. All bags and chips were in place...and safe ;-D These chips are delicious and only four WW points!
4,"Overall the chips were very tastey. My pickey daughter even liked then so that is a real plus for me. Some flavors were better but all did meet my expectations. Try it and see for yourelf, Enjoy."
5,"This chips are really good and it's fun getting the variety pack.  Now, are they as good as ""regular"" chips?  Probably not, but they're also not nearly as fattening and bad for you as regular chips.  Given that these are a healthier version if you want chips, I would highly recommend them!"
5,"I ordered this case of chips as a deal with some vita coco and it was a stellar deal. This size bag is perfect for snacking. The assortment of chips is great, there's something in there for everyone."
4,Love pop chips! The assortment package was a great find but would liked to be able to choose the flavor varieties I  wanted. Did not care for the sea salt and vinegar flavor but all the rest were great!
5,"Delicious, light and full of flavor. It's difficult to decide what my favorite flavor is, but BBQ is amazing! I was impressed with the packaging, but I can't imagine it is too cost efficient or eco-friendly. That is my only complaint. Great product and guilt-free snacking."
5,"I love Popchips. They may take some time getting used to if you're used to the oiliness of potato chips, but they're only 100 calories per bag. Buying a 24 pack saves you money per bag, but you're sooo tempted to eat them with so many bags around!"
4,"I loved this product, and it was better than what I thought it was going to be. My favorite was teh salt and vinger flavor (yum yum) but I hated the cheddar, and salt & pepper ones."
4,"I am not going to lie. I will give you the strait dope. These things are like crack.<br /><br />I will polish off about 4-5 pages of these EASILY in a day (hence the freshman 50! that I have gained!) lol.<br /><br />If you love these, I suggest balancing them out with some kind of carb blocker."
5,"These were awesome!! They have a great crunchy texture and flavor and are very filling. I bought the variety pack to try all the flavors. Didn't care for the salt and pepper, but loved the rest. Will definitely buy more!"
5,It is so wonderful to eat Pop Chips.  I am a loyal fan and will continue.  Tasty AND Healthy.<br /><br />/the flavors are good too and pleasing to everyone with their various choices.
5,what can I say... if you've had popchips in the past and love them... then no better place to pick them up... I love these chips and have bought them without an issue from Amazon.<br /><br />Thanks
4,"I won them off a penny auction site. My 2 year old likes them plenty. I don't think there is any potato flavor, they taste more like ricecakes to me, but are ok. The salt and vinegar is strong holy cow!!"
3,Next time I will order only the original flavor.  The other flavors did not suit me.  Too much of an aftertaste.
5,"These are such a treat when you are craving that salty, crunchy snack. And the multi-box where you get a variety of flavors is perfect. Share it with son so they don't get stale but not much chance of that.  One of my ""3 Points plus"" Weight Watchers Snacks that I don't run out of!"
5,"Got these at a fraction of the price that they charge at the grocery store. This was a great buy. Thanks, Amazon!"
5,I have subscribed these chips. They are so tasty. Not dry or oily. Cannot put it down once open a bag and have to have two bags in a row.
5,"I love these chips. They are so delicious, it is so hard to eat just one bag. All the flavors allow you to taste them all.  My favorite flavor is the cheese ones. Go ahead and try them.  They are so delicious."
5,"these are the best chips ever. I will buy them again, wish more stores had them.The plain chips are my fav."
2,"These chips taste so dry and gross, I would rather eat carrots or something than these. They just didn't satisfy the salty craving and weren't worth the calories."
5,The chips were delicious. I didn't care much for the vinegar flavored chip but the other flavors were great. Didn't have any guilt eating this healthier snack.
5,I eat a bag of these every single day!  They are the best tasting good for you snack! Everyone should at least try them and you will be hooked.
5,"These are quite tasty and delicious, I love them....BUT the prices here are RIDICULOUS!!! Did I say Ridiculous? Oh So RIDICULOUS!!! But Im here to rate the product not the price...5 Stars for the Product."
5,"A little costly but they are good and fresh too, not stale at all. Would recomend to any Cheetos fan."
3,I bought this as a gift for my mother. She likes it but says it is hard to open. When she unwrapped it I remember having to help her figure out how to open it. It took me a minute. If you have arthritis you won't be able to pry this open!
5,I've had trouble storing fresh basil because I learned a long time ago not to put it in the fridge.  My cat is attracted to anything in the plant family (with disasterous results).  This keeps my basil fresh and the cat ignores it!
1,"I threw this away after about a week of ownership.  Couldn't get the clear plastic cover on and off without spilling water all over, and half the time, I couldn't get it off at all.  It only works for long stemmed herbs, and all need to be about the same height."
5,Actually saves my basil and cilantro for an extra week or two. Thats enough reason for me to buy! Before my basil and cilantro would last only a couple days and I would have to toss them out. This saves me money and a trip to the market!
1,This product was a complete disappointment. Tastes like mushy pineapple. There was no papaya taste.
1,"I will never buy this item again!! I was addicted to it until the last order!! Fruits had foul smell, tasted rotten!! Was the expiration dates forged!?"
3,"I tried Tropical Pineapple it was delicious. I gave a bad review for Tropical Fruit Salad becuase it had watermelon and pineapple in it I think the two of these were competeing for the flavor. I see now thats what I think it was, probably not a bad product at all. Sue"
5,"My 1 yr old Granddaughter, and I cannot get enough.<br />and it is good for you!"
4,"I'm a big fan of the Dirty Martini - but I simply can't eat enough olives to keep up!<br /><br />Love this stuff - Not quite as tangy as Dirty Sue, but still very vibrant."
5,"We have reorderd this product many times...makes a great dirty martini..delivery is prompt, product well packed"
5,This is an excellent product.  We always ran out of olive juice before we ran out of olives when making dirty martinis.  Now we have a terrific source for great tasting olive juice and our dirty martinis have never been better!
4,"the last case (a different brand)we ordered from Amazon was so terrible we threw away the entire case.  However, the Boscoli brand is very good and we can enjoy a good dirty martini."
3,What are the white flecks floating in my recently ordered bottles of Dirty Martini Olive Juice?
5,If you like Bloody Mary 's and dirty martinies this is a must. You won't be sorry. I'm so glad I found this product.
5,This stuff is outragous. It is simply the best olive juice on the market. I tried another brand and it did not come close to Boscoli. This stuff is actually better than the olive juice that comes from the jar of olives. I would highly recommend this product.
5,"He never has enough juice left over from his jar of olives, we therefore end up with more olives then we can eat, just buying the juice makes alot of sense."
5,"Excellent service & price for the product, order shipped quickly & received in good condition. Will be ordering again as long as the price stays this good. You really can't beat the price."
5,"The olive juice I purchased was not only inexpensive, but has a great flavor.  I have looked for a long time to buy olive juice for martinis, but I could not find anyone that carried it.  thanks Amazon."
4,"This product is great if you want a dirty martini, I highly recommend this product and it saves you from buying olives and wasting just to get the brine."
1,Ordered this a few months ago only to find it is just basically lactic acid.  Read the ingredients.  The main label says olive juice by no such thing.  I am going to suggest that Amazon take this off the website.
5,We use and buy sea salt instead of regular salt like sea salt came as promised in good condition have nothing else to say
5,"Love this Balance Blend of Oils , especially in mix batters such as : Pancake , Cornbread ,Cake , Etc... , a good oil to ingest !"
5,"Can't live without these little jewels.  Not only is there a surprise in the middle, but it takes me right to the French countryside while enjoying them."
5,"I love these.  I love any floral flavored product. The best part is when people ask for a mint or candy or whatever,  offer these but don't tell the flavor.  The reactions are YouTube worthy."
5,"I ordered these candies for the first time and I am hooked, they just have a hint of rose the flavor is not overwhelming. I really enjoy them. Highly recommended! Unique candy!"
4,"i like it and i find the grinder bottle to be very convenient. i like the taste of it and i would definitely buy it again, and considering its healthy use for sure."
5,I really liked the taste. It is well priced too. It is a great and healthy alternative to table salt. I even used it on salad.
3,"I have never had sea salt before but the 95% sodium free got to me.  It has to be an acquired taste because I don't really like it --- perhaps if I used it regularly I would not want to go back --- and, perhaps if the salt came from other seas around the world it might taste different as well..."
3,The pork chops from Omaha Steaks were very tasty but at the same time exceptionally dry. Pork is usually dry meat but these were to the extreme. Possibly shipping them frozen and keeping them frozen was partly the problem.
5,"This item was received early.  It was packaged well and in excellent shape!  This was a gift and I am sure it will be received well.  After all, Ferrero chocolates..what's not to like!!!<br /><br />Thanks for the excellent service.  Would use this seller again and would highly recommend!!"
2,"I got this on the warehouse deal so I wasn't expecting much. However, be advised you will get NO regular Donut Shop and instead you will receive over half of the box as decaf. I love the flavors of all of these though, so that's ok. But I will think hard about getting another variety pack."
5,I use these for training treats.  I have a large and small dog and this works for both of them.  They are all natural and my pups love the taste.  I highly recommend these!  I also tried the Three Dog Bakery Apple Oatmeal Woofers and those were a big hit.
5,"GREAT CANDY AS ALWAYS FROM WERTHER'S ORIGINAL CANDY, HARD OR CHEWY CARAMELS ARE BUT TWO OF THE CANDY THEY MAKE THAT IS OUTSTANDING. IT SEEMS THAT YOU CAN NOT KEEP IT IN STOCK AND ARE ALWAYS OUT OR JUST HAVE A BAG OR TWO LEFT TO SALE."
5,Nothing can compare to the waffle mix delivered by Stonewall kitchen.  My mom complained about the price but I think the quality deserves the higher price than the regular pancake/waffle mix.  The waffle comes out golden and crispy.  I was using the Presto 03510 FlipSide Waffle Maker.
4,This is a delicious recipe and ingredients and the one I use. A bit pricy but if you don't mind the price point it makes a wonderful waffle. Combine this with a Waring Waffle maker and you could be in Waffle Heaven.
4,"I was expecting great things based on the reviews. While it IS good, it's not great. I believe my waffles made from Bisquick were just as tasty as these, and this costs quite a bit more. The instructions ARE very easy to follow though, and I DO like the canister for storage."
5,"What can i say??  They are wonderful, and the highlight of each weekend.  OHHHhhh  - use soda water for the liquid !  even better !!!"
5,"I usually make pancakes from scratch and have never found a mix that doesn't taste ""off"" to me.  This mix is the best!!!  My family and I love the way it tastes and it is so quick and easy."
4,This is the best tasting pancake mix in the market and it is so easy to make.
5,"My family absolutely loves this pancake and waffle mix. The texture and taste is the best out there, especially when using our waffle maker. You can add fruit and other items to the mix and be as creative as you wish. Your price is great and delivery can't be beat. We recommend it to everyone!!"
5,"I love Belgian waffles and this mix makes a delicious waffle without all the trouble of making them from scratch.  They are really good, and I'm fussy.  I haven't tried them as pancakes yet."
2,"Didnt really enjoy these after wanting to try something other than aunt jemima's from Dominicks. The pancakes tasted strange and sometimes forgettable, but it might have been due to the poor packaging they came in along with the syrup."
5,These pancakes just hit the spot and make me feel like I am eating a restaurant breakfast at home for a lot less money. Splurge on this and the good maple syrup...it really is cheaper than going to Denny's or IHOP where a meal for two will be $20 minimum.
5,My family was lucky enough to get this product several years ago from a friend.  My daughter will not eat any other pancake mix and everyone I fix them for thinks they are outstanding.
5,"I'm sorry not everyone likes this mix, but we love it. It is like going to a gourmet restaurant! (yeah - a gourmet WAFFLE restaurant...) The waffles taste and turn out great, and so easy. Hard for us to believe, but it seems it's not for everyone."
5,"Makes perfect, delicious, crisp on the outside and soft on the inside, waffles in minutes. Worth every penny!"
5,"Makes very good, light waffles. Seems to be exactly the same as Carbon's Golden Malted waffle mix. Only this is more expensive."
5,Bought this mix along with the Cuisinart waffle maker.  Delicious.  We followed the directions and it made only one Belgian waffle.  The next time we doubled the recipe and it came out the right amount.  Good flavor and easy to use.
5,This mix makes great tasting waffles.  A little extra work and expense but worth it.  Need to stretch the recipe a little bit to make 2 full waffles on my new Presto Flipside Belgian Waffle Maker.
5,Stonewall Kitchen Farmhouse Pancake and Waffle Mix is our favorite.  Consistently excellent with a nice malty flavor.  The 33 ounce cans are a Good value for the quality. I highly recommend this product.
5,This mix is the kids' and family favorite. It tastes like vanilla. It's wonderful for pancakes or waffles.
5,This waffle and pancake mix is delicious!  You can taste a subtle hint of vanilla in them.  They are the only pancakes/waffles that my kids love and the house smells wonderful when they are cooking!
5,We first had Stonewall Waffle Mix when we received it in a gift basket about a year and half ago.  We have been using it ever since.  The flavor of the waffles are absolutely out of this world.  We won't ever go back to Bisquick for our waffles!
5,"This has become a breakfast staple for our home. Now nearly every Sunday morning, we are making pancakes. We've got the Vermont Mapel syrup, eggs, sausage or bacon and we're set for the day with a just a light snack-type dinner. Use bettermilk for the absolute best results."
5,"Great mixed for Belgium waffles, family thinks it's the best.  Must try it and order it from Amazon.  I let friends know to use this product."
5,"I found it so hard to believe anyone could give this mix 1 star, I had to read those reviews. Two of them seem like ads for Robs Red Mill, and the other one didn't make any sense. You must be looking for pancakes or waffles, so do yourself a favor and give these a go. They are delicious"
5,"we love this pancake / waffle mix.  It's hard to please everyone but this item does the trick.  Crispy, light, tender, yummy!"
5,"This product is great.  Just add egg, water, and butter (I used oil).  I will never make waffles from scratch again."
5,We made this purchase based on our daughter's recommendation and it is as good as she promised. We have a new flip-style waffle iron and this mix provides us with a wonderful breakfast. We add fresh strawberries or blueberries to the top along with syrup and it is scrumdiddlyumptous!
4,"I have had waffles from other mixes that are too sweet.  I have also made them from scratch.<br />I like my waffles with NO Sugar in them, because I don't like too much sugar.  This mix is very good.  Waffles are just the right consitancy for me and the mix is easy to prepare."
4,"I'm not normally a big fan of mixes but this is a great waffle mix.  It's quick, easy, and produces delicious waffles.  Yes, it's pricier than some of the other mixes on Amazon but I think it's worth it."
5,This is a great mix. I mixed it with milk instead of water.  Just follow the directions.
5,We first received Stonewall pancakes as a gift. We have ordered them 2x on Amazon who has the best prices. Highly recommend this product. Will return here to buy more...
5,"I bought this on a whim because I found some jam made by the same company and absolutely loved it. I didn't expect much more than basic waffle and pancake mix. This is so much better.<br /><br />It's easy to use and makes moist, fluffy pancakes that are to die for. I am never buying Bisquick again."
5,I have used this product for a few years now. This being the first time from Amazon. I'm glad it was there. This is by far the best pancake/waffle mix on the market bar NONE !
4,"The pancakes were delicious, but they weren't as fluffy as the ones I normally make.  Next time I use this, I'm going to whip the egg whites and see if that helps."
4,"No matter how you mess up the recipe, this Mix still makes my family happy in the Sunday morning :)"
5,I hope Amazon restocks this item always.I can't stand the other brands out there since it got this brand.And the price is right at Amazon to.
4,"Heavily touted by the reviews, decided to try.  Mix is good, but not great.  Probably wouldn't buy again."
5,"This is the best pancake mix!  I've sent this to several people, and they all love it. The two-pack makes a nice little gift."
3,"Every week I make waffles or pancakes for my wife and daughter. Their opinion is that the waffles taste different from but not better than those I make with Jiffy mix. As Jiffy mix costs a lot less, I will not likely order this product again."
1,"This expensive pancake mix tastes so processed and fake.  A less expensive bisquick from your local grocery store beats the taste, no doubt.  It's a yucky product."
5,"I'm not sure why, but this is our favorite pancake & waffle mix.  Just tastes the best to us."
2,"Makes OKAY pancakes. Only marginally better than the standard Bisquick recipe. They are edible (I should say that my kids liked them).<br /><br />Not that great, in my opinion."
2,We didn't care for this product at all. It seemed to have a funny after taste to it. Wasn't worth the cost. We were unable to even finish using what we purchased it was that nasty.
5,I hope Amazon always carries this product too. I have ordered it twice. Excellent product for the price. Yum-O!
1,I got two Teas and one type of iced coffe and the rest were HOLIDAY COFFEES and APPLE CIDER!  Spicy Eggnog? Gingerbread? Bait and swtich.  The only redeeming factor - Amazon was great and issued me a refund.
1,"I do not consider Gingerbread, Spicy Eggnog, Caramel Apple Cider, Spiced Apple Cider summer items.... You cleaned off your self at my expense!  VERY DISAPPOINTED!"
3,The teas seem to brew really strong so use a large glass or dilute after... Unless you really like strong tea.<br /><br />It's a good pack to figure out which flavors you want to buy in bulk.
4,very good price and we love our keurig trying the summer flavors are great and will probably order more before the end of the summer.
5,"This was a new product to me.  They were very tasty, crisp, and surprisingly delicious.  I was very pleased with this product."
5,"This product was a gift to a far distant relative.  It arrived right on schedule, in perfect condition and she loved the choices inside the basket.  I cannot attest to the food personally, but she loved it!"
5,These things are addicting and low in calories and fat too.  I love the Wasabi flavor.
5,I would recomend this product for it's fine qualities and taste really good. Very nice and crisp for any snack or with meals when you want to help on the lowering of carbohydrate intake.
5,I'm so dissapointed these are unavailable right now! I LOVE these crackers with cream cheese - it's my favorite snack! I hope they become available again soon! I can't find them anywhere!
5,"I got 1 pack of these from my local grocery store and tasted them for the first time. To me, they taste just like corn nuts. They are quite hard, so I wouldn't recommend to anyone who doesn't like hard foods. They are crispy and delicious snacks tho. Will buy more. :D"
4,"Not as good as Sesmark Savory Rice Minis, but these are available at least. They are VERY good. More healthy than potato chips and a bigger crunch. Mmmmmmmm . . ."
5,"Crackers are great.  Was glad to find them. There is a good selection of flavors.  My favorite is salted, but there are other choices."
5,"Local availability of the Plain variety of these crackers has been unpredictable with stores trimming inventory and dropping all but the highest volume SKUs. Buying on subscription makes it affordable and, so far, reliable."
5,"These rice crackers are truly delicious w/cheese or Peanut butter.  Also I can eat crackers w/o Gluten. As I am allergic to wheat, eggs, Gluten, and Bannas.<br />This is my favorite snack on Sunday nights. They come promptly and save me money. Thank you. J. Wolf"
5,I love these crackers!  Perfect snack for when I need something salty/crunchy instead of potato chips or other greasy snack.  I eat them a lot to hold me over between meals.  The price on amazon is great compared to my local markets.  Highly recommended!
5,You can purchase this for $35.00 including free shpping straight from Penta's Website.<br /><br />I really enjoy drinking this. I can see a difference with my everyday life.
5,"These are my most favorite nut snacks. Sunflower is my absolute favorite, but the almond, cashew (very buttery and rich), and seasame are really great, too.  Have given as gifts and everyone follows up to ask me where they can buy them.  Great for the kiddos, too!"
5,Baby loves to feed herself and these are a great on the go option. We have tried other brands (Gerber) but this is her favorite by far and I don't feel bad giving them to her as I know that they are high quality. Hubby tries to steal a few away here and there as well :)
5,"I've bought them many times. Good quality and good taste, baby love it, and I love it too. Reccommend it."
4,"My 1 year old son does really like these- andthey certainly taste better than some of the other finger food snacks.  The only issue is there are lots of crumbs in the can they come in, so it gets messy if you want to dump them into a baggie for on the go."
5,These are a great alternative to chips.  I wasn't sure how they would be based on other reviews but I am glad I bought them and wish I would of found them sooner.  I have twin 18 month olds and they can't get enough of them.  I like them too!
5,"My son is only 9mo, so he can't say it yet, but he LOVES these.  He gets excited when I even take them out of the pantry!! I like the fact that they are organic and also have carrots."
5,My son loves them and I can give them to him knowing they melt in his mouth so won't choke and they are good for him too.
5,"Happybaby Happymunchies Baked Organic Cheese and Veggie Snack, Cheddar Cheese/Carrot, 1.63 Ounces (Pack Of 6)<br /><br />Hello, this is six items should be installed, but I only received a, I with amazon contact but nobody reason I, please verify as soon as possible, give me reissue, thank you!!!!"
5,I love Plum organic pouch.  Got this one on sale.  My baby and toddler LOVE this so much.  My 3 years old always ask me for more.
5,"Have had other brands like this before, and have always enjoyed them.  These were a really good bargain on sale."
5,My 8 month old loves this & has no problem holding it & sucking the food out.  This is great for on the go!
5,this makes feeding on the go so easy! my one-year-old will suck down a pouch in 5 minutes and she loves them!
5,Not as tasty as the strawberry but still very nice. Great to throw in a diaper bag or purse. Spendy but definitely a good deal when it's on sale.
1,This flavor is awful! We absolutely love all the other flavors but goji cacao & maca is really difficult to get down. I give all the other flavors 5 stars!
5,"Delicious and nutritious! We live for coconut and nut treats since we don't eat grains. When I want to splurge, I pick up a bag of these from Whole Foods or my local indie health store. They average around $10 here unless they're on sale. :) I'd looove to be able to buy these in bulk. YUM YUM!"
5,"I just switched from Merrick Whole Earth brand pate style to this upgraded line by Merrick and my dog loves it!  This a great for dogs that like ""human"" food."
5,I give Merrick canned food as a treat and mix it to my dog's dry kibble (and the cat even gets a taste) every now and then.  The Chicken Pot Pie smells better than any human chicken pot pie I can remember.
5,This canned food has real chunks of chicken in it.  Dogs love it.  Looks and smells better than human-quality canned beef stew (like Dinty Moore).
4,This tea is very good.  I discovered it while visiting in California. The moment I got home I searched local stores for it and I was not able to find it.  Finally I decided to see if Amazon had it and they did and I bought two boxes.  As long as they make it I will buy it.
5,"The tea tastes great and helped me curb cravings during dieting. The tea was inexpensive and came packaged in a pretty box. The bags are flimsy, but I just throw the bag in a tea ball with no worries. I will continue to keep this on hand as part of my tea collection."
4,I love this TEA. It has a very smooth taste and not bitter like other kind of tea. I do agree that the string seems to come apart easily but I can live with that. No big deal! The quality of TEA makes up for that.
5,"Not much else to say... I keep a box in my desk here at work, and I can enjoy a cup anytime!  Nice flavor, and no bitterness, so I can drink it straight without sugar!<br /><br />Pros:  Flavor and value.<br /><br />Cons:  It can't do my taxes for me... that's really about all I can think of.  lol"
4,"I got tired of overpaying for tea at Teavana so decided to try this brand of Oolong tea and was pleasantly surprised. It has a wonderful flavor and like the previous reviewer, I just put the bag in a tea ball to compensate for the poor quality of the bags. You just can't beat the value of this tea!"
5,"this is a high quality oolong tea and i can't go back to bigelow, that's for sure! the taste is great, it is said to have slimming benefits, and the tea bags are a higher quality that don't come apart easily."
5,I got two bags from my friend who got it from his friend who said it was primo. So I chucked them in a zip-lock when I got home. 3 mos. later I opened it and had some today. I am online trying to find more.
2,"Holy cow!  I have never seen this much grease in a boxed product like this!  Also, it has enough salt to kill an entire family of slugs!  Use it in your garden, don't eat it!"
4,"Using the entire sauce packet is over kill, leaving a salty greasy puddle at the bottom of the carton. Otherwise noodles are well made, and sauce is reasonably well flavored. Quick and easy, a no brainer."
4,"This is pretty good stuff. You can't expect a whole lot from instant box-o-noodles, but this is the best out of all the other brands I've tried before. The noodles have good constancy and the peanut sauce is really tasty as well. I'm going to buy more."
4,"while its not traditional satay  it is very good the oil is ok cause without it it would be too dry, i had some of these that were a year and a half old i made it and it was fine, i will buy again"
1,"I love peanut satay.  This product is truly terrible.  In no way does it resemble that dish.  Oily, salty and tastes lousy.  Don't waste your money on this brand."
5,I have been using this product for years and was happy to find it on line since our local place (Bristol Farms) had closed.  I love it especially in my salad dressings.
5,"Fast, professional transaction.  I needed this one ingredient for a new recipe and it turned out great!  Now I just need to find more uses for this stuff."
4,Only Pom.Mol.I've ever used but this seemed to have the same flavor the Chef came up with for a pomegranate relish for fish. It seems to have a bit of a brown appearance though where the one the Chef used was a brighter red color.
5,I would recommend this product.  I received it in a timely manner and the price was good.
5,"Always wanted to make my own hummus and eggplant dip - this brand of tahini I'd never tried before or seen in supermarkets, so I decided to order and try it....excellent by itself or in recipes! Highly recommended."
4,This was a very good puchase. The shipper was very fast and very friendly. The Tahini was very fresh and of good quality. I will order again.
5,"We love to make Hummus, and love to make sandwitches, salad dressings. One of our kids favorite foods is Tahini over cold Undon Noodles."
2,"Very bitter and not nearly as thick as expected. Very runny, actually. There are better brands out there."
4,We purchased these for our son to give out when his baby boy is born.  They make a very nice announcement of the new arrival.  They are however very hard if you actually want to chew the bubble gum.
1,"I purchased this item to celebrate the birth of my grandson.  I should have opted for real cigars, they might have tasted better. These cigars were very hard and hurt my teeth to chew. Not to mention that these gum cigars were much too sweet."
1,ordered some from an amazon-fulfilled associate. Normal amazon shipping etc...The cigars were cracked and stale. How does chewing gum shatter and break? No way it was fit for consumption.<br />Easy return process.
5,"This product arrived in a timely manner, in good condition, and it was a hit with the family when my son arrived."
5,I have nothing but good service ever since I started ordering from amazon.com.  Keep up the good work.
1,"Buyer beware! The label on the Amazon site clearly states ""D.O.P Certified"" but the product received does NOT match the site label and does NOT state ""D.O.P. Certified"" This is bait and switch and I will file a complaint with Amazon."
1,"these are not DOP they're just ""certified"" which means nothing significant. they should go a step further with a little more nonsense and write ""department certified"". real dop tomatoes are much better."
5,Purchased a small case of these tomatoes. I used them for Pizza Sauce and they tasted great. The labels looked identical to the picture posted on Amazon.
5,"I love San Marzano tomatoes and Cento's are great. They have the greatest, sweetest taste ever. Worth ever penny and than some."
1,They tomatoes are certified San Marzano but not DOP like the item shows in picture. I called amazon and they sent me another box of 12 for free to fix issue. THe new shipment was still certified not DOP.  So please know this. Tomatoes are ok but not the best fyi.
2,"I purchased a case of these tomatoes a couple of months ago, and the cans were so badly bent and warped my can opener won't open them.  I complained to Amazon and they shipped another case out right away - but those cans are worse than the first case!  I won't order again."
1,"The product image is misleading. The image has the tomatoes as D.O.P. certified, but the tomatoes I received are not...."
5,"these tomatoes are perfect for italian recipes.....full flavor, not too acidic and VERY italian!  Always the best choice for italian cooking...."
4,"most if not all of the cans were dented in some way, however it is a cheaper method of purchasing this product"
5,"This is a fine product.  Why? Sure, it's has a flavor that on other tomato has, an earthy taste."
1,Merchandise was not damaged during shipment but supplier send me damaged and incorrect merchandise.  3/4 of the cans were badly dented and the cans they shipped were not DOP Certified.  They sent me lower standard merchandise.  Received full refund from Amazzon.
5,"The product is great ... but it is priced nearly twice what it retails for in local markets. I dont mind paying a little for convenience of home delivery, but this is too much"
1,It's a shame to use so much corn syrup for babies! I'm very disappointed when I noticed that. The same kind sold in China is even better.
1,"Do you really want to be feeding your baby a bottle of corn syrup???<br />i used this until i realized that. i switched to gerber, its so much better for your baby."
1,"I decided to try this formula for my baby since he started being very gassy. However, this formula made him more gassy...the formula is very thick and produces a lot of bubbles that gets fed to the baby. I tried to make the formula with anticipation to let the bubbles disolve but that didn't work."
5,"Great formula, our son is not getting stomach pains like with the regular Similac and he actually likes the taste.  The only thing is that it's way cheaper at Costco ($27.82 per 34oz + tax). Amazon is NOT willing to price match!!!"
4,The M&M candy machine works just fine but the finger hole is too small for adult fingers to retrieve the candy. It does intimidate a M&M lover because of the small amount it dispenses.
5,"Like always this label is the best in desserts and this 3-4 ounce vanilla pudding is not the exeption, is easy to make, and vey fast, and the size is the best for a little families. The vanilla flavor is fantastic."
4,"i always enjoy Jello pudding, however, one package that i recieved was opened, and the powder spilled all over.  it really alters the price when you only recieve 23 packages instead of the promised 24."
5,"My big boy Oreo loves this so much. i took him off beef products and only give him venison rabbit ,turkey. He can't get enough of this stuff"
5,"Delivered by UPS, this product is just about perfect.  It does not have a disagreeable smell and the dogs love it.  It is much less expensive than prescription dogfood and our dogs are thriving on it.  You can even see an occasional pea and/or carrot. No grain to worry about."
5,"This mild semi-soft/soft cheese has a range of subtle flavors that I have yet to find elsewhere.  The price is worth it, though I can't afford to order it often, but the combination of this cheese with a really good white wine is truly a culinary delight!"
5,This tea is absolutely incredible! Addicted after first taste. So delicious... the smell... the taste... it's a beautiful experience. I just ordered more (and gonna try both regular and decaf).
5,"I love this tea and drink it at least twice a day.  The flavor is both strong and sweet.  The tea stands on it's own, never needing sweetner.  If you're a cinnamon lover, you have to try this tea.  And even if you're not, it's worth a try."
5,I am fairly certain this is the same tea sold by Caribou Coffee.  I think I could be considered an addict! The flavor is so good - lots of cinnamon and slightly spicy because of it.  Price for 50 is good and less than I have been able to find it elsewhere.
5,"Love this tea, its like drinking liquid red hots.  I hate herbal teas b/c they all taste and smell like potpourri but this stuff is awesome !!!!"
5,A co-worker gave me a couple of the Harney & Sons Fine Teas Hot Cinnamon Spice Sachets to sample. The cinnamon spice flavor is wonderful. These teas are not available at my local grocery stores. I was glad to find them for a reasonable price on-line.
5,I love this tea which has a deep cinnamon aroma and taste.  It's equally good as an iced tea.  Full marks!
5,"I drink a lot of flavored black teas and this is hands down one of my favorites. The scent is enticing and the flavor is bold, and sweet at the same time.  If you love spice, this is a must have tea."
5,"Super tasty, super delicious. Best tea ever, sweet and cinnamony. I actually like these better than the individually wrapped tea bags."
5,"This is an excellent tea, very flavorful - the cinnamon is fresh and powerful, and overall it's slightly sweet without needing any sugar. Excellent with milk or straight."
5,It's that good!  Heaven if you like cinnamon.  Tastes sweet with no sugar.
5,I was actually surprised at how good these Muffins taste! I have reordered a case.  And they are Gluten Free.
5,Had this sent to me in Afghanistan. The flavor was enjoyable but not to spicy. It is made with quailty ingridents. I would surely say this is one of the best salsa's I've ever had.
3,"I really like the frozen Corn Muffin Tops, but the mix resulted in a dryer product. I used the paper muffin liners and I think these might have added to the dryness."
2,"I found this muffin to be dry and very disappointing. If I cut it up and put it in a bowl with yogurt, it was OK. Would not order this flavor again."
5,better then I expected. I notice there was some complaints that the muffins were dry.<br />So I sprayed the mix before cooking with a butter flavored publix spray which is canola oil.[same as pam butter spray].<br />This did the trick& they were great
2,Too much of the white pith on this orange peel making the product overly bitter and diluting the real good taste of the orange zest.
3,"The tea bags work well with loose tea and buying the pack of six makes this a good value. But what you're not told is that the bags are the large size, better made for large pots and not single cups."
5,I like loose tea and hate having to clean out the metal holders.  These bags are ideal as they let me make a pot or just a cup of tea and then throw it in the compost pile to be reused for my garden.
5,"My Scottish Terrier inhaled hers in about 2 hours, but my finicky Pomeranian, who usually turns his nose up at chew toys, loved it! It kept my Pom busy for a few weeks, but he really enjoyed it!<br /><br />Affordable price, fast shopping, great product!"
5,I love this frosting!  It's sugar free and I cannot find it in stores.  I will be ordering more in the future.
2,"The treats were ok,my main complaint is they were small about the size of a lifesaver.Which made it hard to give them to my medium size dog as a treat.One treat just di not do it.This package should be labeled for toy or small dogs."
2,Too much of the white pith on this orange peel making the product overly bitter and diluting the real good taste of the orange zest.
5,"Juice consentrate is very good. I like it as much as the Tart is Smart and with the price increase it is considerably cheaper even with subscribe and save. This will be my staple tart cherry juice from now on."""
4,Tastes like drinking a cherry pie. I purchased this for my mother's gout and she told me it works quickly. It's also supposed to help lower blood pressure. Speedy delivery. It's not 5 stars because of the high price.
5,Every bit as good as any other brand I've tried. Fantastic taste and easy to use. This stuff can become addictive.
4,"Good, and reasonable for drink. A product that is good for sleeping and inflamation. I will buy again if the price stays reasonable."
5,"This cherry juice concentrate taste very cherry :-)  <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0032JKWGI"">Country Spoon Montmorency Red Tart Cherry Juice Concentrate 34 oz.</a> I like this product, and, perhaps, I will order this cherry juice concentrate again."
4,This is very good but I prefer the liquid cherry juice.  Less messy to deal with and the concentrate doesn't seem to go as far as the liquid juice.  Just my preference.
2,Too much of the white pith on this orange peel making the product overly bitter and diluting the real good taste of the orange zest.
5,This product is a quick snack very light and tasteful with any spread or just like it is. Takes up hardly ay space if a couple of packets are placed in your bag. Individually wrapped crackers makes it stay fresh for longer periods.
5,"If you like SweeTarts and you want them in a bulk amount, this product is for you. The SweeTarts came perfectly sealed and in excellent condition. There are no downsides."
5,"I have ordered these a couple times now. They arrive super fresh and sealed every time. I used to buy a roll a day from the gas station, now I have a stash at home that is available anytime. Yumm"
5,"I've purchased bulk candies where they are old, terrible flavors, or simply smashed to dust. This was a great buy, having none of those drawbacks."
5,"I used these for my sons bday party as one of the sweet treats to have out.  they are great, the kids all loved them and the price was fabulous, way better than purchasing elsewhere.  the item came as described and was fresh.  Thank you amazon.com"
5,It is very very good sweets<br />Amazon always is excellent<br />Amazon always is excellent<br />Amazon always is excellent<br />Amazon always is excellent
5,"Excellent shipment and product as well , looking forward to purchase again , thanks<br />Excellent shipment and product as well , looking forward to purchase again , thanks<br />Excellent shipment and product as well , looking forward to purchase again , thanks"
5,Just returned from Italy and was told these little chocolates were the favs of the Italians--perfect little two-chocolates for gifts -- and gloomy days -- or happy days --
5,"Delicious candy.<br />Outstanding price for such a rich product.<br />The ""fortunes"" on the inside are an added bonus.<br />Great options relating to packaging."
5,"Instead of Simple Solution Lamb & Rice I was sent Simple Lamb & Oatmeal but, my dog likes it. Next time I will make sure I am sent the right food. I didn't know until I had open and put the food in my 10lb container."
5,quality food but the price is very high.  luv amazon's free ship over $25.
4,My husband does not like whole wheat anything but he liked this pizza dough. It was very simple to make and spread on our pizza stone. We put Rossi Pizza sauce and mozzarella cheese on and it was great!
5,Great stuff!Love that it's organic and raw. But later saw same thing @ TJ's for less than half the price!
5,I love this organic raw honey!<br /><br />When using it in my tea I don't need a lot and the taste is great.<br /><br />Honey is also helpful with moisturizing and healing so other than consuming it I also use it on my hair and face often. The darker the better.
5,I absolutly love these candies that are only put on the market at Christmas and Valentine's Day. I would buy them all year if they were available: SO you can imagine how excited I was tao be able to get them for a while through Amazon.I can wait untill Christmas when they will be available again.
5,"Cant find this flavor in the stores, so bought them here online.. Like them so much better than the Peppermint ones... I also like the Cinnamon Ones... Yum-O(as Rachel Ray states)..."
5,The local merchants quit stocking this. Was pleased to buy this on line so I can make French Canadian pea soup again. 5 stars for ability to obtain since quality is not that much of a factor. All of Bob's Red Mill products are 5 star.
4,"Its hard to find this stuff locally. Usually my parents have to bring it to me when they visit. Was pleased to find it on Amazon.<br /><br />Makes GREAT, TASTY dhall. We eat a lot of it, so its nice to know I can get it here again when I need it."
5,Bought these for a change from the green split peas. They are tasty and I like them. Will buy again. Always like Bob's Red Mill products.
5,"Full bodied tea, no loss of flavor even though it is decaffeinated. Comes stored in its own heavy duty zipper plastic bag to ensure freshness during shipping. A great value for a good tea."
5,"I love this coffee, its dark but not bitter and smooth as silk. Its a big cup size 12oz so its great in the morning when I don't want to get up for coffee too much. If you have a Tassimo you should have this coffee blend on hand!"
4,it tastes pretty decent but I wasn't aware how pricy they were when I bought them.  I paid $17.44 for a pack of 12!!!  What a rip off!
3,"I love these cookies, but this paticular batch was stale, very hard, & I had to dip them in my coffe to eat them easily."
1,"If you are ordering cookies, beware, the 'cookies' arrived in crumbles, so, if you want a box of stale crumbs order away :)"
1,"Two of Aunt Gussie's cookies contain 23% of daily fat allowance!  The cookies are so full of grease they fall apart.  They may be sugar free and gluten free, but they make it up with mostly FAT!  I can't even give them to my grandchildren!"
3,"They taste nice, but they made my stomach hurt and gave me a bit of flatulence issues (because of the chicory root fiber). It also made me bloated."
4,"Yummy. Good flavor. I wish they were softer and not so crumbly......and for some odd reason they give me heartburn, and I never get heartburn. I still like the flavor."
5,"<span class=""tiny""> Length:: 1:00 Mins<br /><br /></span>These cookies are so great! Watch our video to see how great they really are!!!"
5,"Great coffee.  Rich, robust.  A coffee-lovers choice.  If you like French roast or Italian roast, you will like this coffee."
5,I love this coffee. Very dark but not at all bitter. I finally found one I like as much as Jet Fuel.
5,"My husband loves strong Caribou coffee but I like the milder one or ""breakfast<br />type. I will drink this but Caribou of all kinds is a great coffee,no matter<br />how strong. It will not disappoint."
5,"Most Caribou coffees are too weak for me. This one is a delicious exception. It's right up there with Revv, Emeril's bold, or Van Houtte's eclipse. A Dark bold coffee without tasting burned or bitter."
5,"Caribou's Mahogany is my favorite k-cup coffee.  It's got a great, rich taste.  It's dark, but not bitter."
5,It has a nice strong flavor with no bitterness.<br /><br />How strong is it? I would say it is similar in strength to auto-drip using 1 rounded tablespoon of coffee per 8oz of water.
5,"I've been drinking Green Mountain's Dark Magic and really enjoyed it, however I wanted a change.  After some searching I discovered this coffee and am glad I did.  It's got an excellent deep flavor that I really enjoy.  Strong enough - yet not overpowering.  I recommend you give it a try."
4,This coffee has a good flavor and a good strength.  At first it seemed strong but then I got use to it.  I recommend this flavor coffee. Good wake up in the morning.
5,"I hadn't tried Caribou brand K-cups before and am extremely picky.  I like a rich, intense, well-bodied coffee and this product delivered.  Strong but no bitter taste, when brewed with 6 oz. water.  I would recommend this product to anyone with similar tastes and will definitely buy it again."
5,"Very Smooth Rich flavor even on the largest setting, dark blend a very satisfying cup of coffee. I will recommend this to my friends.  This product arrived on time well packaged."
5,"Smooth. Full of flavor. Not bitter. No nasty aftertaste. People that like Newmans extra bold, Starbucks Verona and Sumatra, Tullys French Roast and other dark cup should love this.  It's better!"
4,"Nice bold taste but with a little ""packaged"" overtone.  Like other K-cup products this is just a shade below fresh."
5,"The name of this coffee is Mahogany, in my mind a deep rich brown. The coffee flavor is deep and rich, and the color is dark brown. It is delicious."
5,I ordered the Mahogany Caribou Coffee K-Cups and adore them.  I recommend this product if you like bold coffe with a smooth taste.
5,This is a serious cup of joe. Yummyness!<br />I have turned at least 3 friends onto this coffee.<br />Robust and aeromatic
5,"this is maybe the greatest coffee ever made.  i have had this many time before in regular bean that i grind myself,  but never in k-cups.  Tastes the exact same and its maybe my favorite coffee ever"
5,"I like the taste of this coffee. Tried the other brands but got stuck on this one, I also like the ECO friendliness of the company."
5,"This is the best Caribou kcup if you like a dark, hearty roast with good flavor and little acidity.  Will definitely buy again."
5,"I have been drinking Tully's Kona for the past 2 years, but with the price increase of kona, I needed to find something less expensive. After trying numerous kcups, this Mahogany is just as good as the Kona, with a full coffee flavor, and a hint of caramel. I am happily converted."
4,I enjoyed this because of the full taste I get out of it without it being too bold or having a burnt taste.  To me it is a bit above the medium blend.  I do take creamer with my coffee so the boldness may be tamed down. I will definitely order more of this when I'm am out.
5,"I could get very used to this!  This is a nice, strong, robust coffee without bitterness.  The K-Cups are so convenient and make no mess."
5,I really enjoy this coffee - I have used a variety of the K-cups and this is one of the best.
5,Strong smooth velvety flavor.  Mahogany describes the color and the mood you get when drinking. Absolutely the best. I've found my favorite.
4,"I've sampled many different k-cup coffe types. I prefer a really robust coffee and Carbou mahogany really dosn't provide that. I would cassify it as medium roast coffee with a smooth melow taste. If that is what u are after , then give this blend a try."
4,"No bitterness.  A strong, full-bodied, cup but does not taste like ashes.  Smooth, very drinkable.  If you like bold, dark coffee, this will please."
5,"In my office, and for me personally, this is the smoothest and best tasting coffee you can buy for your Keurig machine. Great price too!"
5,I have tried about every k cup brand....Caribou Mohogany is my all time go-to brand.  Flavorful yet not strong and no jitters.  You get the same great flavor whether you make a small cup or a large one.
5,"If you like a bold cup of good coffee...and have a Keurig single up brewer, this is the flavor to buy!  Never dissappointing with Carbou Mahogany!"
5,We love this coffee. It is the best K cup we've found. We like strong coffee and struggled at first to find one that we enjoyed. The prices on Amazon can't be beat and the shipping super fast.
4,My husband enjoyed this coffee. We usually use Newman's Extra Bold but thought we<br />would try something different. It was a bit too strong for me; I prefer Newman's. But it was<br />still good.
3,"This coffee is inoffensive, but not strong enough for my tastes.  I do use cream, and I'm sure that makes a difference."
4,"I like strong coffee, but I don't want it to taste burnt or have an acidic after taste. Caribou Coffee's Mahogany is full bodied with a nice balance of dark notes and acidity.  It's one of my ""go to"" coffees when my favorites like Coffee People's Wake Up Call are out of stock."
4,I like my coffee strong. This is the first brand that I have tasted that provides the kick I need without the bitterness. I keep my pantry stocked with Mahogony and I do not share!
5,love to order my coffee on amazon.  easy and shows up quickly.<br />This k cup is great coffee.  dcaf is very good as well
5,One of the richer coffee for k cups! We typically grind our own even for the Keurig but the Mahagoney from Caribou is a great alternative. Order was shipped very quickly.  Will definitely buy again.
5,"This is a great coffee.  Its dark but not bitter, a little chocolaty, and it reminds me of an Adirondack lodge.  I can get them for a better price in a Caribou Coffee store, however."
5,"I've tried quite a few coffees and many end up tasting the same. However, this and the Italian Blend by Timothy's are two that are very good black or with cream/sugar. If you're looking for a simple coffee without all the flavors, this is the one for you."
5,"I've tried over a dozen varieties of K-Cups and this is, by far, my favorite!  It's strong but not bitter and just has a great flavor.  This will be my choice from now on."
5,"Without beating it to death - If you like a full bodied, but mellow brew this might be for you.  It is hearty, but not at all bitter.  It holds a nice full body, even when the Keurig is set to the oversize setting.  It's now my favorite blend."
5,I go for the bold varieties of coffee and this Mahogany is not only bold but very smooth.  My all time favorite!
5,"So Far this is the only K-cup I've found thats tastes great with a normal brew!  It's not watered down like the regular stuff, and dosen't taste burnt like the bold stuff. They only K-cup i'm buying from now on!"
5,"We've tried every coffee brand available for the Keurig, and this one is, by far, the best.  It's extraordinarily smooth and rich - the closest to Starbucks, if that's your thing.  I add to it a healthy splash of Bolthouse coffee/mocha - very good."
5,The Mahogany has a smooth full bodied character.  I highly recommend this coffee to drinkers looking for a bold but not overpowering taste!
3,"This coffee is not really bold in my opinion - it falls more along medium roast flavor. It's a decent, smooth coffee, but I didn't think really bold. Like all k-cups though seriously overpriced!"
1,"If you like strong coffee, as I do this coffee is over rated. I found it weak, with a sickening after  taste."
3,"This coffee is very full bodied, and has a great aroma; however, it is the only K-Cup coffee I've had that has a bitter aftertaste. I would still drink it if someone offered me a cup, but I won't buy it again."
5,This was sold out at Cafe Express site.  Thrilled to<br />Find it here. Quick delivery and great service!  Happy to know that I can find it here.
4,"This coffee is very smooth but rather flat compared to Starbuck's brews.  It doesn't have any bite to it.<br />If you like a mild coffee, you will enjoy this one."
1,Please contact the manufacturer and ask them to change back to the old formula if you love this product! We just cancelled our subscription of 8 cases per month because the new formula is disgusting! Not buying again unless the change back to the old version!
5,O. N. E. Coconut water is delicious and refreshing. It is amazing how it rids me of cramps in my calves and lower back.
5,I happen to like foods that arent as sweet as kool aid or other sugary drinks. Very refreshing after mowing the lawn and helped  keep those afternoon headaches away.
5,I got the O.N.E. Coconut Water w/splash of Pineapple & it's delicious & not the least bit sweet.  Just very refreshing!!  LOVE IT and will continue using it.  Saw this on Dr. Oz as he recommended it.
5,"Being a ride leader with a bicycle club, I use coconut water (with its high Potassium and vitamin C) as an energy drink. I prefer this product to that you find in ethnic markets, because it has no added sugar and it hasn't been boiled."
5,I have tried all the different brands of coconut water and O.N.E. is my favorite and O.N.E. Coconut Water with a Splash of Pineapple is my favorite flavor. I wish the price would come back down I absolutely love this stuff!
3,"I didn't expect coconut water with a splash of pineapple juice to taste quite so salty, even if it does replace electrolytes, so that was off-putting.  It's not really bad, especially over ice, but I won't be ordering any more of it."
3,"This is good but not as good as the standard coconut water in this brand.  The container is smaller, there is no straw, and I like the taste of the plain one better.  It is OK."
5,Sojos foods have been tested for nutritional content and they are all formulated to have a calcium to phosphorus ratio of 1.4:1. You do not need to add calcium or phosphorus.
4,I think this is a great product but my picky dog gets tired of it after a week.
5,My small mixed breed is a picky eater but he seems to like solos so long as I mix it with some good people food. He hasnt had problems digesting it  Delivery was prompt as expected.
4,I didn't mean to order a 40-pound bag. But I did. Wow. That's a lot of food. Be sure to mix it with protein or else you dog will suffer a bit of internal distress.
1,"Sojo's diet lacks calcium, and if fed as directed will cause severe metabolic bone disease in your dog.  This diet requires supplementation with a balanced calcium/phosphorous additive to be safe."
3,"It doesn't have a whole lot of flavor, but most light roasts don't.  It does have a unique flavor, but is kind of rich and tiring, so I recommend you mix it with other coffees to make it taste better and make you other bland coffees taste a little better."
5,"I recently moved and couldn't find a thai restaurant nearby. My favorite meal at my old thai place was massaman curry. I used the recipe on the back on the package when I got it, and it was JUST like what I get at the restaurant! Excellent flavor!"
5,This is really delicious and not something you can find in the local grocery store.  If you did it would be very expensive and a much smaller quantity.  This is a good deal and super easy to use.
5,"Previously I bought some mustard seed that was unbearably bitter, but the mustard I made with this seed is very tasty and (after mellowing a few days) not bitter at all. Pleasantly spicy."
5,I love to put a bag of Pumpkin Crunch on the table at work and watch people's faces light up when they taste them.  Try it.
5,Mrs. May's Pumpkin Crunch is the best of the bunch.  If you like pumpkin seeds this is for you.  The slightly sweet cubes make me think I am eating cake.  These are great for snacking and even dessert. A truly wonderful product and gluten-free into the bargain!
5,"<a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000EH2AMA"">Mrs. May's Dry-Roasted Snack, Pumpkin Crunch, 2-Ounce Pouches (Pack of 24)</a><br />Pumpkin Crunch is great.<br />Stick with 2oz. size (2 servings)<br />Much too easy to consume entire 5.5oz. bag without realizing it.<br />:-D LOL"
5,"it has good tast and crunchy. I bought black sesame before, it is good too. highly recommanded."
5,"Like I said about the icing....I am so happy to be able to buy this online. It is a family favorite, it also was shipped on time and arrived early. Definitely going to buy again."
5,I tried the cookies and they were great nd trying to find them in the stores<br />with no success. did not realize they were seasonal or would have stocked up<br />great product
5,Works wonderfully for most all applications in the garden. Could not be easier since it is systemic and helps fertilize only what you want to fertilize.
5,"These chips are good to sprinkle on salad, use in cookies and baking and sprinkle on cereal.  Very pleased."
5,This is the best mustard. my husband loves it on his sandwiches for work. it has the right spices and taste to enhance what you are eating. Have been looking for it in bigger tubes with not much luck but any size is great.
5,"There isn't much to say about this mustard other than ""Ummm Ummm Good!!!""  I tried this for the first time at a BBQ on a salmon burger and it truly brought the flavor out of the meat...now I use it on everything from chicken burgers to homemade Caesers dressing!  You'll love it!!!"
5,"Great with bratwurst, breakfast sausages, salami, cheddar cheese, sandwiches, etc., even though it is a bit exotic/expensive to use with sandwiches where it tends to fade into the background, it's best to keep it simple and let it stand out."
5,We became acquainted with this mustard when we were in Switzerland and really enjoyed it. That was our reason for purchasing it. Great find!! We have liked this as much as the one that we bought in Europe!
5,"The Lobster Bisque is absolutely delicious. Nice lobster flavor; I cannot imagine what you could possibly add to improve the taste of this soup. Just open, heat and enjoy. I've become such a fan of the Baxter's line that I can't wait to try them all."
2,"The taste is good, but I found myself biting down on small bits of lobster shells more often than acceptable. This made me not want to finish my bowl of soup."
2,"It is ok soup, but I expected more, as I love lobster bisque and tried so many different kinds in different places. This one is very watery and I could not find any lobster there. I guess it is ok for the price, but I would NEVER buy this brand of the lobster bisque again."
3,"For canned soup, it hits the spot decently.  There's definitely some lobster flavor and small chunks in it.  However, the whole thing tastes a little on the fishy side.  If I was served this in a restaraunt I think I'd walk out."
4,"This soup is pretty good, not great! I put some heavy cream (1-2 oz) and some Tabasco in it. I have had a lot better Lobster Bisque - But at a much higher price..."
1,Saw this soup in the supermarket and bought a can. Opened can. Heated soup. Tasted soup. Dumped soup down drain. Rinsed mouth with mouthwash. Enough said.
1,"This is one of the worse tasting soups I've ever eaten. I hated it, and now I have a full case.  It tastes bitter to me, and my husband wouldn't even try it.  Only my cat was trying to reach it on the counter!"
5,Good product. But remember that you need some way of grinding because apparently we can't digest whole flaxseeds.
5,Bought this as a way to take in omega 3 nutrient. The pack of 4 has lasted me almost a  year. You have to grind up the seeds and freeze the rest. No complaints; very reasonable pricing.
5,We are VERY happy with these Organic Golden Flaxseeds.  We grind them and put them in so many things plus they make a great topping for yogurt and cereal in the whole seed form.  These are now a staple in our house.
5,I have very little to say about the product except that it is a GREAT product and their delivery subscription works very well.
5,Great for you! Grind them up and add a few tablespoons. Can't tell it's there in your cereal ect..
5,"This brand always makes good products, since you buy bulk they turn out to be quite cheaper than in the supermarket. very clean flaxseeds. I add it to my smoothies to bath my joints with some natural raw omegas, supposedly they are better if eaten sprouted, though haven't tried it."
2,"I wasn't thrilled because I had to pick out tiny bits of gravel. The flax seeds themselves were fine, top quality. If it weren't for the gravel bits (that get through the sieve w/the seeds, I guess?), this would get 5 stars."
5,"It's also a routine baking ingredient. I put it into my bread along with sunflower seeds and organic wheat flour. I also put it into my smoothie, stir fry dishes....anything you can think of! Good price and really, it's a must have for a healthy diet!"
5,Looks fresh and clean; I have roasted it in the toaster oven and I also use it in food whole or ground up in the coffee grinder.
3,It was my mistake - I thought there were 6 bags rather than 4. So the price per bag is much higher than what I pay at the local grocery for the same product.
4,The flax seed is packaged in separate smaller packages so that it can stay fresher longer and it was recommended by the flax cookbook I purchased.  This seed was cheaper than other brands I had checked on.  I am putting it away for any emergency that may arise.
5,"I bought this before I realized how much I was getting and before I knew they had it at the grocery store! That was my own fault. I really should have waited. But the seeds are great, I just have way too many in my freezer!"
2,Given the recent issues with products made in China I have decided to not buy any food products from there so I won't be buying anymore of this snack.  If they ever switch to made in the U.S. I'll buy it again as I did like it.
5,"These are wonderfully crunchy and delicious. The calorie count is misleading, however! One piece is more than the 25 calories they claim it is. But it's worth it!."
5,The nuts used tasted very fresh. The bite sized chunks were just right. It is lightly sweetened but not too sweet. Very satisfying = )
5,"These are fresh, crunchy, natural, and healthy snacks you can reseal and keep in the car, crumble into non-fat yogurt or over salads, or pack some in the kids lunch. Convenient and delicious."
5,"Delicious, healthy, plus Amazon is cheaper than if you buy them from Mrs. Mays actual website."
4,"Love these snacks! They're a little bit sweet, loads of crunchy almonds. Am looking forward to trying the other varieties, too."
5,"My husband has diabetes and has to watch what he eats....this is a great and healthy treat for him!  I couldn't find it at local stores, and was happy to see it available on Amazon!"
5,"My family and I love Almond Crunch, they're just sweet enough, very crunchy, and a perfect snack."
5,I have tryed the Almond Crunch and is delicious and healthy snack better than chips Try it you'll agree
5,"This product is excellent. It's also a nut snack that my wife, who has celiac disease, and is allergic to wheat and glueton can enjoy. I however can eat anything and this is the tastiest and most unique nut snack I've ever tried.  Al & Virginia Weatherly  53996 Luzerne Dr. Macomb, Mi 48042"
5,This is by far the most delicious snack you could ever have!!  The almonds are super fresh and crunchy and the light coating of syrup is not too sweet.  My whole family loves it!!
5,My husband and both love almonds. I've even shared this snack with co-workers and everyone is raving about the good taste of this snack.  I'm taking a few bags on our next backpacking trip.
5,This is a great product.  We tried it at the beach the first time and loved it.  The cashew crunch was not as good.<br />We bought a case of the almond this week.  Just great!
3,not real crazy but this product. They did not taste good but looked real cute in the little booties I made for the baby shower tables.
5,"I am in love with this tea. Every other apple cinnamon tea I've tried has been too cinnamon-y. This is the perfect blend. It tastes like apple cider without all the sugar, which I love. I recommend this tea to anyone who wants a low-cal version of apple cider."
5,"This is the perfect gift with a southwestern flair.  The jelly's were of decent size, the spreader is a nice quality piece with a small glass chili pepper attached.<br /><br />Cute little bag - great gift for the price!"
3,I thought it was okay but not Harbanero BBQ sauce from Hell.I would probally not get it again.Also it was not worth the money I thought it was kind of a ripoff it was 10$ for barbque sauce you could have made at home.
5,"Best taste pasta. Cooks very well, slightly less time than typical mass produced pasta. Nice color and mouthfeel. Just excellent."
5,I have long searched for a great linguine and spagetti and this is it! Just made linguine with clam sauce and each time my husband remarks how terrific it is.  I buy in packages of 5 for both spagetti and linguine and will reorder when close to being out.
4,Good product just a little mellow on the pumpkin pie flavor to me. A little sugar on top before you brew picks it a enough though. Overall good coffee
5,These are hard to find these days.  Product arrived perfect and the gum was fresh and tasty.  We kept the box for about 1 year and the last pack tasted as good as the first.
2,"I expected the flavor to be more like that of ""brewed"" green tea. It really does taste like dried green tea leaves simply dissolved in water. Although I'm sure this is probably a good way to get a concentrated amount of antioxidants, I wouldn't order this again."
5,I KEEP THIS AT WORK AND I MIX IN MY SMOOTHIES AT HOME- LOVE IT!
3,This tea is not so tasty in my opinion. But one thing about opinions is that every one has one and we do not always agree.
4,"I make a ""jug"" of this tea every morning and keep a glass throughout the day.  I'm delighted to find a source in the US as it was introduced to me in B.C.  It does not have the jasmine flavor which upsets my otherwise very strong tummy."
5,This is good iced tea. It is hard to find locally in the Fall and Winter.
5,This is a quick and convenient way to drink green tea! I add lemon juice and stevia.
5,"I think this is a great green tea powder.  I add this powder to a 24oz water bottle and it has a nice light taste, I prefer it unsweeted so that I may add a sweetner if needed.  Great price for the quantity and the quality of the product."
5,I use the powdered tea powder in my fruit smoothies.  Provides you all the health benefits of green tea.  Love the product and use both the plain and lemon ginger.
5,I like the mild sweet flavor of this instant tea.  I've added it to lots of different drinks like juices and energy drinks.  I have fun mixing it with things.  It blends well for me.
5,I went on a diet last year and was looking for something goos to drink and came across this tes!  now I can't find it anywhere... Hope Amazon keeps this product forever!
5,"I wanted something easy, tasty , and healthy to sub for my diet soda addiction. This did the trick. I drank it for 10 days without adding any sweetener. Once you get past the color, which is a nasty green, the tea is tasty. About a half tsp of sugar really adds to the taste. I will buy this again!"
4,"Good flavor, but not real sweet.  I add a little stevia for my sweet tooth."
5,"THis ice tea, is like heaven on ice.  must try if you love lemon and giger.  Great price for the content.  You can make a pitcher with 4 bags and add some lemon and whatever your sweetner you prefer.  Great for barbeque parties or a tea with the ladies"
5,This tea is awesome.  You have to keep stirring it if it sits too long but the taste is great.  Little prep time- keeps me going all day.
1,This tea is the most awful stuff I've ever put in my mouth.  It has a chemical taste.  I tried adding sugar and it didn't help. I enjoy the Arizona Pomegranate Gree Tea and would highly recomment it.
5,This is good iced tea.  It is hard to find locally in the Fall and Winter.
5,I am hooked.  This is a great way to get more fluids into my day without making it seem like a chore.  This powder tastes great without any additional sweeteners.  It is just what I have been looking for.  Also try the Blueberry version.  Delicious!
5,"Just the right amount of blueberry flavor, and the tea itself is not overwhelming. I love that it has no added sweeteners, and really does not need them.<br />This is a perfect way to get more water and benefit from the antioxidants in the tea as well!"
5,I drink this delicious tea almost every day.  I have yet to find anything like it on the market.
5,Love this product!  It adds flavor to your water without all the nasty artificial sweetners.  Hope this product is here to stay!
4,"<a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0012BSMJM"">Stash Premium Green Iced Tea Powder, 12-Count Packets (Pack of 6)</a> Easy to mix and refreshing with ice."
5,"I was looking for mint green tea I could carry with me to mix up while out and about. If that's what you want, then this product is perfect. I add a little extra water, but that's just my taste. So, if you're looking for mint green tea powder . . . look no further!"
5,"This has a great rich taste. Remember this is ground whole leaf, so the tea is stronger than you may expect.  Not overly sweet and dissolves readily.  I use it during workouts mixed with ice water in a Polar bottle."
5,"I liked the flavor and the ease to mix this tea.  I use a few packets and make a pitcher to keep in the fridge.  Very good COLD and needs NO sweetening as is lightly sweet already.  Doesn't look pretty, but DOES look like a healthy drink!  I liked it!"
1,The tea was very weak and not that good. Now I have six boxes of tea I that no one in my family likes.
1,This iced tea is terrible. This is the first Stash product that I do not enjoy. It is not iced tea. It tastes more like powdered peppermint leaves.
5,love the ease of having green natural tea anywhear any time . tastes great i love this stash green tea
4,"<a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0012BZGHS"">Stash Premium Mint Green Iced Tea Powder, 12-Count Packets (Pack of 6)</a> Light mint taste, easy to mix powdered tea, great on ice."
2,This was a big disappointment. There was no raspberry or pomegranate flavor to this. The color is green and not very appealing to look at. However it does work as a great antioxidant.
1,I wish I had read the product description better....I didn;t realize this was sweetened...I do not like the sweetened teas...now I am stuck with 2 orders of them....but the other green tea powder is great.
5,WOW!  I am a PEPSI-holic and was gaining weight as you can imagine. A little 85 year old woman introduced me to your tea HOT.  AND now with just A LITTLE bit of honey and ice I have a nice cool refreshing drink!!
5,The fragrance of the tea totally blew me away. Recommend it to anyone who enjoys mild green tea with a pleasant rosey scent.
4,"I am enjoying this tea and the price was reasonable.  I don't think the rose flavor is as pronounced as my favorite rose tea, but since I can not get that one at this time, I ordered this one, and it is very good."
5,"Good beans.  I can't find these in the grocery stores where I live, but ordered them through this retailer with no problems."
5,their not only good for you but their yummy.they smell like cloves when their cooking and taste  a little sweet.
5,Good stuff - like lentils you don't need to soak these.  They are small so feel good in the mouth.
1,We purchased from the original website 8 flavored sugars all but the raspberry was worth the money the rest had little or no flavor at all! It was expensive and not worth the money.
5,I have never tasted any better! Need to keep refrigerated or it will lose color and flavor but is worth the price.
5,"Mixed with whipped cream and blueberries this lemon curd is a delicious, easy, quick summertime dessert that will delight any guests."
5,"I won't claim to be a professional food taster ... I just know what I like and don't like.  I don't like ""yellow"" popcorn, I don't like microwave popcorn, I like the ""white"" popcorn cooked in a pan.  For my ""popping style"" the Baby White pops great w/o lots of hard kernels.  'nuf said."
4,"This is really good. Tender, a little sweet. Easy to make in the Whirley Pop, and excellent with some Cheddar & Spice popcorn seasoning!"
5,"We like the much harder to find ""white"" popcorn over the more common ""yellow"" popcorn and Amish Country Baby White is our absolute favorite.  We usually order 3 of the 6 lb bags 'cause we go thru it so quickly."
5,I love this popcorn. Only downside is the shipping and packing. Cost almost as much as the popcorn. Need to pack it better. Bag split and a bunch of loose popcorn falling out of the box when the guy brought it to my door.
2,"I purchased the baby white by accident.  We usually get the medium white, which is great.  The baby is so small when popped that the taste and texture of the hull shell really overwhelm it."
2,"Tasty, small kernel popcorn. However, too small and too light to be popped in a hot air popcorn popper. The kernels are blown out of the popper before they are popped."
3,The gourmet corn is smaller kernels than I like so would probably not buy it again.  But with their special oil and the Stir Crazy Popper every kernel pops every time.<br /><br />I will probably return to good old Jolly Time.
5,This is the best popcorn I have ever had.  As a kid I ran the popcorn machine in a theater so I feel I know what I'm talking about.  We used yellow popcorn but I still think white is best.
4,"Baby white popcorn from Wabash Farms pops nicely, has no meanacing hulls to get into your teeth, and is very tasty. What more could you ask from a popcorn? I highly recommend this product. At least a four star."
5,"The small, white popcorn is the best!  Very delicious - and I've tried lots."
5,"This was the sweetest, smallest, hulless, best tasting white popcorn I have ever had.  Just placed an additional order for a 6 lb. bag as well as other varities carried by this company."
5,Great popcorn!! Good popping results and wonderful flavor.  Can't help but love it and I will re-order when I run out.  Recommend to one and all
4,"I love little white kernels of popped corn.  This was good stuff, but I think I'll try a larger white kernel to pop next time, my preference."
5,Pops great in the microwave.  Much better than many store brands.  Good product.
3,"I was disappointed.  I thought being Amish and according to the advertising that it would be exceptional.  But it's just popcorn, no better than others I've purchased.  So, so. I would not buy it again."
5,"I just made some in my Whirley Pop.  It really is lighter and crisper than the larger, yellow kernels.  None of those large hulls either.  The only difference is, it pops up much smaller than the yellow, so you need to almost double the amount of kernels used per pot.  Lovely homemade popcorn."
2,"Popcorn has grear color (white)  But taste is average and due to shipping costing more then product, I would not buy again."
5,This popcorn is really great!  We enjoy the taste and the smallness of the actual popcorn.  Its not like the popcorn that is big and fluffy its small and really great to eat.  I eat only this popcorn now and order every three months. Highly recommend to the popcorn lovers of the world.
1,"This is  terrible popcorn! No taste, poor popping ratio. and the size OMG! I popped this Gourmet popping corn in front of a party, everyone busted out in laughter!"
3,If you like your popped corn small this is for you. Taste is good and it is crisp yet tender. The only real complaint is it has a disproportional amount of hull.
5,popcorn is very good.  cant believe the difference between this popcorn and the regular stuff at the story. a very good purchase.
3,"Received the ""Baby Yellow"" instead of the correct ""Baby White"" kernels. Unable to return the product since it's a grocery item, but Amazon.com customer service did an excellent job and provided a full refund. As far as can tell, no other issues with product."
4,"I liked the idea of the small popcorn.  It pops up really well in the popper but it doesn't have much if any ""popcorn"" flavor.  Was pretty bummed by that."
5,I have made this my popcorn of choice.  I enjoy the flavor and kernal size.
5,"Get it, Get it, Get it! This popcorn is truly the most tender, delicious popcorn I have ever tasted."
5,"Got three different Amish popcorn's for my daughter's Birthday..she is always on a diet, I got her the hot air popper same time...she & my grandson..( he's 4) loved it..she ate a bowl every night &  still lost 15 lbs !! not saying it's a diet food, just satisfiing !!"
5,"I bought this for my daughter's new microwave popcorn popper as a Christmas gift, and she says that it is delicious, but pops up smaller than other popcorn.  She likes it a lot."
5,"This is very high qulity pop corn, I recomend it.  Almost all kernels pop and they are a crisp white when they pop.  Very healthy and yummy!"
5,"Pops fully, few spare kernels with the traditional stovetop method.  Small, fluffy kernels, not a lot of 'misfires' that are only partially evolved.  My wife says they're a tad too small for her taste, but the kids and I really love this popcorn."
4,This popcorn brings me back to days before the microwave version. What a treat it was to savor the taste and lightly salted lily white popcorn that was popped over the heat of a stove burner again.
5,"I love this brand,  all kernels pop and they are a nice size, texture and flavor."
5,"I'm a huge popcorn fan and have tried all sorts, and the Amish Country brand popcorn is the best I've ever eaten.  Absolutely delicious!"
5,"There are very seldom any unpopped kernels, which is nice and the flavor is wonderful. Not a whole lot to say about popcorn. I always buy from you guys and will continue to."
5,"I love white corn, in all its forms, including popcorn. And I hate how outrageously expensive the kernels are in the supermarket, so I love this popcorn."
5,"I enjoy it practically every evening, it is very good popcorn, not as much hulls and small when popped."
1,This popcorn has alot of hulls I order 4 bags and can't stand to eat it it's so hully - terrible
1,"I ordered this because Amazon recommended it to go along with the Redenbacker popcorn popper I got from them. Hey, only a few of these actually pop! Most of these small, unpopped kernels get thrown out of the popper. What an absolute waste of money!"
3,"This is good popcorn, but it is very small so you need to make twice as much as you normally would."
1,worst popcorn ive ever bought.  chewy not fluffy.  gave it to the birds for bird food.  postage was outrageous!  just not a good experience all around.  wont be buying from them ever again.
4,"This is delicious popcorn -- lost a star because I use a hot air popper and many of them  ""jump"" out before popping.  Great flavor, great texture - tender.  I do not add anything even though I have purchased three different flavored toppings.<br /><br />Thanks,"
1,"This ""Baby White"" popcorn pops small and somewhat hard.  I have tried several batches with various adjustments of heat, using a ""whirlypop"" popcorn popper.  Unsatisfactory results!  I won't purchase this again."
2,wE LOVED THIS POPCORN  BUT COME ON  SHIPPING IS WAY OVER THE TOP  WE WOULD SETTLE NEXT TIME FOR SOMETHING WE CAN BUY BUT NOT SPEND 3 TIMES ON SHIPPING
4,"Why is this $[...] when the same product is available for $[...] here?<br />http://www.amazon.com/VICTOR-FLY-MAGNET-BAIT-REFILL/dp/B00004RBDY<br /><br />The Victor M380 and M502 traps are unreal, of course -- total fly genocide. Pretty stinky, but only right nearby."
5,We have used the Victor fly bait for 3 seasons.  Can't beat it.  Great product!
4,This is our preferred clam chowder . We like the natural taste with lots of potatoes. The only complaint is I think the soup can be creamier. Amazon has much better price on this with subscribe and save.
4,"It's not as good as I hoped, but canned chowder never is. I added some butter, a can of chopped clams, and some milk - then thickened it a bit. It works great as a base, but not for me straight out of the can."
5,This is the best clam chowder ever. Come originally where this is produced and was so happy when I found it on line. Keep this in my cupboard at all time. Being an old Maine girl this is my favorite chowder of all times.
5,"The best canned clam chowder I've found currently available.  Very light, nicely seasoned, creamy taste.  Not fishy or oniony.  Good amount of minced clams per serving.  To find better chowder, it would have to be homemade."
1,"Bits of ""Clam?"" (not sure) in water with something I assume is potatoes. Whose recipe is this? save your money get something worth having. How do so many like this?! It's awful! If you prefer REAL Clam Chowder and not seawater with something floating in it DO NOT buy this!"
2,"I expected better from a premium Maine chowder. This is no better than, say, Snow's, which you can get for less than half the price. Not bad, but not worth the money."
1,We opened a can of Bar Harbor clam chowder and could not believe how few clams were in the chowder.  There were mostly potatoes.
4,Even though the chowder is very very good as is - I add a can of the Bar Harbor Chopped Clams to it - along with a can of heavy cream and a huge pat of 'budda' ....<br /><br />yummy ...
3,I was really excited to try clam chowder from Maine but it did not wow me.  I think Campbell's might even be better....
1,"One perfect box. No rips, tears or gouges. Inside the box? 6 badly dented cans of chowder that looked like they fell out of an airplane. Every single can! Very disappointed. Should I return them all? Is the chowder any good? Was this a joke? I rate this 1 star...for the unblemished box."
4,very good clam chowder.not as good as being in Maine in a restaurant but much better then other canned chowders
5,"bar harbor clam chowder is an excellent product. easy to fix and has tremendous flavor, nice amount of clams and potatoes. you will enjoy this product very well !"
4,"This arrived earlier than expected, which was great! However, for some reason, this particular product smelled a little like ""fish food"".... but no worries, still tasted like great cashew butter, just the smell was kinda weird - like fish food. Also, I wish this product was organic."
5,"My dog likes the Iams savory sauce.  It helps to tempt him to eat when his appetite is off, and it's good for him."
5,I HAD READ ANOTHER REVIEW AND THE REVIEWER WAS CONCERNED ABOUT THIS PRODUCT COMING FROM CHINA.  I CALLED THE MANUFACTURER AND WAS TOLD THIS PRODUCT IS MADE HERE IN THE US.  MY DOG LOVES THEM!!
5,"This is a new treat for our ""kids"". They are pretty picky eaters, especially my girl! They both love 'em. Glad I found this product. Reasonably priced too"
5,"I have a German Breed, G.Sheph. & he is VERY, VERY, PICKY! He loved them. He is such a happy camper. He wakes up in the morning & ready to go for his walks & comes home straight to his treat cabinet, he wants his chicken stix....thank you, finally something that my boy loves...."
3,"With the Prime shipping, this made a great last minute gift. It seems a little pricey for the amount of fish, but the quality was good (according to the person I gave it to). In the end, I think this is better than a fruit basket or something similar."
3,"I think pack of 4 for $25.00 is too much ($6.25 per box). I got them in Target for less than $3.00 sometimes. Also, maybe because of promotion, I got them for $2.80 or around that at Safeway. I will not buy this one online. TASTE is FIVE STARS, but price is ONE STAR."
4,I like the slight pineapple flavor in this better than the plain coconut water. Good well chilled. Coconut water is supposed to be a healthy drink.
4,"Love this juice. Scheduled shipment is convenient and economical. This is a very expensive beverage and any way to save some money on it, is worth it"
5,Shipping great and loved product. The boxes are a little tough because there is not a lid if you do not finish.  I suggest buy only little ones this way.
5,Pineapple is hands down my favorite flavor of Vita Coco! It not only serves a great electrolyte replenishing beverage (aka the PERFECT hangover cure) but it can also be made into a pinacolada if you just add some rum :)
4,"I really like this coconut water, but I was surprised that per 17oz box it's the same price at Wegman's.  Probably won't be ordering again unless there's some sort of discount."
5,"Heard about this drink from a friend and had to try it. Had one while traveling and loved it!!! I sat on the plane enjoying it...I was thinking, I should bought another one!"
3,I subscribe to this monthly but just got an email stating that it's changing from 17 oz. to 16.9 oz. - but no price change?  WOW that's a really lame cut to increase their profit margins.  Whatever I won't miss the .1 oz. obviously but how about messaging and acknowledging your devoted consumers.
5,"Of all the flavors Vita Coco produces, the Pineapple combination is by far the best - it has just enough flavor to keep it interesting but not overpowering."
5,The pineapple coconut combination is refreshing. I especially like that there is no added sugar. This is a welcomed change from other brands.
5,I like this product so much I have it delivered monthly!  So happy to be drinking this at work while my co-workers are stuck with pop!  It's so refreshing and revitalizing!  The only coconut water flavor I like is pineapple!  Transports easily and stores easily with the screw-on top.
5,I always feel refreshed when I drink this coconut water. The pineapple gives it an added extra that makes it truly irresistible. It has been a firm favorite of mine now for nearly a year.
5,"I tried quite a few varieties of this brand and the pineapple is the best.  Light but refreshing.  I am not sure if I think it is a miracle elixer or anything but I did purchase a case and look forward to drinking this on a regular basis.  Thank you for the great value and convenience, Amazon."
5,I use vita coco coconut water with pineapple to mix with my ultra-meal nutritional supplement it mixes well and taste great.I have it for breakfast every morning.
5,If you haven't had coconut water with pineapple juice before then you need to try this! Simply delicious and so healthy for you!
5,Good thirst quencher. Milky and thicker then I expected. Not what I would call a pineapple flavor but one can get the idea it is pineapple.
5,Short and brief.  The product has a wonderful coconut taste and the pineapple addition is light and mildly sweet.  I will certainly purchase this again.
4,"I've always wanted to like coconut water - low in calories, high in minerals - but I've just never liked the taste much. The pineapple juice in this really makes a difference. It still needs to be well chilled to be good, but it makes a healthy post-workout drink."
5,Love the pineapple flavor. Makes me feel like I am on vacation drinking a pina colada. (You probably could add a little rum and.....)Really tastes better than other pineapple coconut waters I have tried!!
5,"This product is a good addition to fruit smoothies.  It thins it out while adding good taste and electrolytes, which are good during the very hot weather."
5,"I love this water! I started buying it after my Bikram yoga classes to rehydrate, and now drink it whenever I feel a little dehydrated.  Living in AZ, I tend to not drink enough water so these help tremendously and are delicious too!  Try them! You'll be hooked :)"
5,Vita coco water is taste great by itself or mixed up in a smoothie. It is great for re-hydration after a workout and has more potassium than a Banana.
5,IT SAYS ON THE BOX EACH DRINK CONTAINS: THE POTASIUM OF 2 BANANAS & MORE ELECTROLITES THAN A SPORTS DRINK. THEY MIGHT SEEM A LITTLE HIGH PRICED BUT GO TO GROECERY STORE BUY 2 BANANAS & 2 SPORTS DRINKS AND YOU WILL PAY MORE TO GET THE SAME NUTRITION YOU GET FROM 1 JUICE BOX OF THIS COCONUT WATER...
5,"Great before, during, and after a workout. Great natural electrolytes, Very high in potassium, amazing drink! This is my favorite flavor, tangerine is 2nd"
5,Great real coconut young coconut taste. Not the usual overwhelming sweet taste seen on other coconut water canned drinks.  Good on the environment. Made in Brazil. Even better.  You can really taste the fruit labelled on the product besides the coconut water taste
1,"I bought this at a local gas station near my house and was excited to try it because I see it everywhere. It was nasty. I will never drink this crap again, I don't care how ""good"" it is for you. The taste is disgusting and I'd rather just drink regular water. Blah!"
5,I'm so addicted to these!!! You know the movie When Harry Met Sally? When I drink one of these it just feels like that famous scene in the movie... orgasmic!
2,"The product description says 12 packs of 12 (144 count), but when you order, you only get a box of twelve.  I did this weeks ago, talked to Amazon, but they still haven't updated the product description."
5,"These are a great snack for any dog who has food allergies to chicken. My 20 pound Sheltie loves them more than any other chew or rawhide that we have given her. I highly recommend these for any dog, especially one with food allergies."
5,I have an old english sheepdog. He absolutely loved the treats. It took him longer than I thought it would to eat through one so I could eat a treat in peace while he chewed on his. It was great.
5,"My dog craves these...one each morning. She's never had digestive problems with them, unlike the beef rawhide bones which we wont give her. WE couldnt find them suddenly in any of the stores and i was soooo delighted Amazon had them! Right to my door quick!  thank you amazon!"
5,I love this gum.  It is very dishearting that it is so difficult to find.  I was hooked on the Cinnamon Extra until that went away.  Now this item is not available.  This world needs more Cinnamon lovers.
5,Is so good. Lots of flavor and great coffee taste. Especially good to wake up with. Enjoy this coffee. I give it a plus 10.
5,I love how fast my cups arrived. I will always get my k cups here! I can't wait to try something new.
4,We have several of these machines at work and I've tried lots of different flavors and blends...this is one of the few I can keep down without my body convulsing with an involuntary shudder.  Lots of these instant coffees are very bitter or far too strong.  This one is actually very tasty.
5,I've tried a handful of other brands of French Roast and I find this one and Tully's version to be both great and comparable in flavor. The difference is the price (this one is far more reasonable).
4,"This coffee has a nice bold flavor, not too strong, but smooth and bold enough that you know your having a wakeful, full bodied cup of coffee that is really enjoyable.  If you like a distinctive, medium bold cup of coffee you will love this."
5,one of the best choices so far.  If you like bold coffee you will like this one  Will definitely buy again
4,"I prefer stong coffee but my husband does not like it quite so strong.  It works well for me.  The way he made it work for him, he makes a cup and a half and that suits him.  It also makes the KCup last twice as long!"
5,"This is great French Roast. For whatever reason, it is also cheaper (in 24-count) than the other Green Mountain Coffee roasts."
5,"I find many K-Cups are weak and not what I am used to (Starbucks), but this french roast is a pretty good subsitute to the $2 coffee I get from the store."
5,"I enjoy them a lot and so does my son. I have to say that this kind is one of my favorites. It is full of peanut butter flavor that you forget that it is only 100 cals. As for the amount you get in the bag, it is more than I expecting so I was very happy."
4,"I enjoy the Peanut Butter Cookie Crisp, but they are definitely a departure from the originals.  Still my son LOVES them so for this reason I still give it four stars."
5,"I really like these.  They are so light and airy, almost like chips instead of cookies!  The flavor is that yummy OREO chocolate we all know and love!"
4,These are good but the flavor did not resemble an oreo. I purchased these along with the chips ahoy and those did resemble the flavor of chips ahoy. In my opinion these tasted like animal crackers. I will stick to chips ahoy 100 calorie packs.
5,"I have been eating the 100 Calorie Chip Ahoy for sometime. I really find that it is a filling, guilt-free snack. It has a unique taste of its own - not a `diet' food-type taste either, it taste like a `real' snack."
5,"Love this snack.<br />Its really tasty.<br />Filling for my wife, not me though...""I'll take 2 please"" =)"
5,"how good these cookies really are.  They're delicious, satisfying, and really, really healthy.  Definitely a great alternative to ""real"" cookies."
2,"I was sorely disappointed in these cookies.. They are pretty tasteless and damn hard too.. I wouldn't buy them again and I've certainly tasted much better low-cal cookies.. I definitely recommend saving your money, folks.."
5,"When you have a craving for a sweet but you don't won't too much, this bar is just perfect.  It's yummy."
5,"I don't usually like really crispy cookies, but the taste of these changed my mind.  I like that you get quite a few for only 100 calories.  I often go for ""quantity"" over ""quality"" so I would rather have a few thin crisp cookies than one regular cookie."
5,These are our favorite indulgence at 100 calories for a sweet fix and energy- they are the best!  Sad to see on Amazon they are no longer available ;-(<br />Quick shipping and they arrived safely!
5,These cookies are just enough when you crave a sweet little snack.  My 3 yr.old granddaughter likes to say the letter<br />before she pops it in her mouth.
5,"These 100 calorie Cakesters are delicious!  Both the vanilla<br />and the chocolate are great, they satisfy those little ""sweet""<br />cravings and its only 100 calories for three little cakes!"
5,"I have recently joined Jenny Craig as  I need to lose some weight, and these 100 Calorie Pack cookies are the greatest thing for snacks.  I appreciate the opportunity to get them from you so reasonably. I have agreed to take a shipment each month."
5,"My family is on the last box.  My oldest daughter ate most of the cookies.  She likes peanut butter more than anything, and these 100-calorie pouches had just the right amount and they taste great."
4,These are more like a cracker - good for a little fill in for between meals.
2,Chips Ahoy cookies were not very tasty.  My children and husband would not eat them.  I tried to give them away and everyone refused.
5,Super yummy! Really hits the spot when I want a chocolatey snack that won't break the calorie bank.
5,Such an easy way to buy calorie controlled snacks.  The arrived quickly.  So easy to take to work or when you need just an easy snack.
5,"I absolutely love the Oreo Thin Crisps cookies <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000F9Z1WI"">Oreo Thin Crisps 100 Calorie Packs, 6-Count Boxes (Pack of 6)</a>. They taste great and satisfy my chocoholic craving without compromising my diet."
5,I love Oreos but hate the filling.  These prevent me from having to scape the filling out and they're good for you - calorie wise.
1,"These things are low cal oreo's: minus the creme, minus the cookie! The title ""oreo"" is basically a total misnomer. These are nothing but black crackers with some sugar. If that is what you want, then click purchase."
5,"They all taste really good. It comes in Mango, Strawberry, and Red Bean. They are each individually wrapped so you only have to eat one at a time. There are 20 of each flavor as well. When I finish this canister I plan on buying another. *^^*"
4,"you can find the sogo sweet rice mochi at Costco now, just 7bucks sth<a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0042TR2WE"">Sogo Sweet Rice Cakes Japanese Style Mochi Assorted Flavor Cannister</a>"
1,This comes in a case of 24 so I bought one can locally before ordering the large amount.  Good move!  I have 3 cats and none of them would eat it. This review is for the mature gourmet beef entree. Haven't tried the other favors yet.
5,"This is the perfect food for my cat & in fact, the only one she will eat - wet or dry."
3,"This food is working well for my 19 1/2 year-old-cat with kidney problems.  But I can't find any info on how many cans are included for this price?  I'm guessing 24 cans based on shipping weight and the price, but I won't buy without better info."
2,"Sent this as a gift, and found out later that many items were stale.  They loved the thought, though, and loved the way it looked."
5,"BEST coffee I have ever tasted.<br /><br />My wife, neighbors and friends are all CRAZY over Jamaican Me Crazy!!!<br /><br />You must try it!!!"
5,absolutely delicious  have tried it on everything from meat and fish to scrambled eggs highly recommend it
1,I did not know anything about chutney until I went on a known recipe cite and found out that they mix the fruit with peppers and vinegar! I thought chutney was a different form of Marmalade but I was wrong!
5,"Same great taste as the honeybush tea bags, but so much more green!  Thank you for packaging this in bulk!"
5,"We use this in place of sugar for almost everything.  It has a light flavor, sort of similar to honey without the crystallization and the strong flavor.  The best part is the lack of sugar highs and crashes due to its lower glycemic index."
5,I was truly amazed at how great this product is. The flavor is everything that you can expect from a sweetner that is this pure! I will be ordering it again and I will try the other flavors as well!
1,"I was disappointed when I received this shipment, as the seaweed contains MSG, and it's not listed as an ingredient.<br />Amazon was very gracious and refunded me the amount of purchase."
5,My little ones love seaweed and rice and this seaweed did not disappoint.<br />other brands are too oily or salty or not enough.  This one though is just right.<br />I would be buying it again... and again.
5,"Great for sushi, or for use with Korean kim-bob, or maybe just as a snack. Lightly salted, great crunch, and will support, rice, beef, pork, even fish.<br />Or a vegetable or two."
5,"I found this stuff to be very tasty, great with jasmine rice or just as a snack. I don't mind a little MSG if it enhances the flavor."
5,"This is my family's favorite brand of wheat free gluten free cake mix. This brand is moist, tasty and closer to the traditional cake mixes  people are used to. Namaste products are the best in my opinion of what's available out there in health food stores. Try it! You won't be disappointed."
1,I tried vanilla cake mix and pizza crust mix and was disappoined in both.  They had a medicinal bitter taste and even smelled strange.  I threw both items away.
5,I added 3 tbsp of sugar and half tsp of pure vanilla and a pinch of alum  free baking powder and  coconut oil for oil  and it came out soo good. My son loved it . I liked it too. The fact that it's all the major allergens free makes it better.
5,"Excellent for GF.  Not bad on it's own but I have used it as a basis for coconut cake, pineapple upside down cake, tres leches cake and others."
5,"I think Namaste Gluten Free Spice Cake Mix is their best but vanilla cake is pretty good,too. I especially like it with whipped cream and strawberry sauce with a dash of ground orange peel. In my oven,the mix bakes better in muffin cups or a muffin pan than in a rectangular pan."
1,"The chocolate cake is fantastic, so I had reason to think that this would be as well - not the case.  It was very dense & tasteless - totally unlike the airy, tasty chocolate.<br />I want my money back or an even exchange for the chocolate cake mix."
5,This tea makes me sleep better than sleepy time tea. The taste is also pretty good. I make mine very concentrated<br />with less than 3 ounces of hot  water and I cover the mug top with a plate and wrap a towel around the whole thing<br />and let it sit for as long as I can before I drink it.
5,This tea smells and tastes like Christmas! This has always been my family's favorite tea for children's (and big kid's) tea parties.
5,I began purchasing this tea years ago and looked forward to it each year. For the past two years I was unable to locate it in my local stores so I was elated to find it at Amazon. It tastes like cinnamon and red candy apples to me. I love it!
5,So glad to have found this tea...it's my absolute holiday favorite!  Thanks for the fast shipping too!
5,"It's hard to rate tea. It's very good tea, but tea nonetheless. However, the company that sells this particular tea was very nice to deal with. They shipped the tea very quickly. I'll most likely buy from them again when the need arises."
5,"The fortune cookies were shipped immediately and were packed well, i.e. none arrived broken.  The cookie was delicious and the fortunes were classic chinese (and not the modern version)."
5,My daughter's Kindergarten class celebrated Chinese New Year and we were in charge of providing the fortune cookies.  This company had a prompt delivery and the cookies were a great success.  Her teacher commented on how funny the fortunes were for the kindergartens.
4,The cookies were kind of stail but other than that it was fast shipping and good packing the cookies weren't broken
5,"The cookie is crispy good and flavorful.  The fortunes are thoughtful, not the shallow ones we are seeing lately.(Be patient, even in time an egg will walk)  I received the quantity and quality I ordered."
5,"I am very pleased with this product. I almost did not buy them because they looked green on my computer, but when I received them they were the normal tan color that most of them are."
5,This is the second time I have ordered this product.  I was happy enough the first time to place an order again.  Cookies were fine and delivery was very quick. Thank you.
5,Well packed. Few are broken but it is understandable. The cookies are tasty and the notes are interesting. My friends and I really enjoyed it! Thx!
5,"Great Product, fast shipment,the food product tasted great. none of the fortune cookies where opened.  i would buy again from this seller!"
5,"I bought these as a gift for my sister, I was so excited to see that they arrived in great condition. My sister loved them!"
4,These cookies were a big hit at our progressive New Year's Eve dinner.  Everyone enjoyed reading their fortune each time we arrived at another house. They really kept the party moving...
5,"Bought as a Christmas present. Smells like a milk shake. I might have to try it, might make a coffee drinker out of me!"
4,"I bought this for my sister for christmas...she loved it, but was afraid she'd eat all of it at once, so she took the box to work.  Within 1 hour, it was finished by all her interns!"
3,"This tastes just like Wint-O-Green Life Savers. It's a hard, sweet, crunchy ring, with a minty flavor. That pretty much describes it. It's a crunchy mint shaped like a ring."
5,"Although I prefer to get my tuna in the foil packages, what I had ordered appears to no longer be available through Amazon so I tried these and they are handy and pretty goo eating for one.  Toss on a salad, or use on bread or toast to add good quality protein."
5,"I keep a stack of these tuna cups at work, along with lemon juice and teriyaki sauce for variety.  They are low calorie, satisfying, and nutritious.  I'm sold on them-- now buy in bulk and keep on hand all the time!"
2,"If you want the best wild rice, buy the regular kind. This ""quick cook"" type is not near the taste quality of the regular/ 40 minute cook time rice.,"
5,"This is the best one. Bob's Red Mill doesn't hold a candle to this. It's fluffy, delicious. and doesn't stick to the pan.<br />I use 4:1 water to rice....Yum"
5,I like to put wild rice in many dishes. This is a good buy and easy to drop into other rice dishes or soups.
5,"Got this to take along on backpacking trips with the horses.  It works fine for that purpose, the size is perfect and worked like a charm.  The two horses didn't attempt a getaway, at least.<br /><br />Easy to put up and easy to take down, along with the portability makes this a camping winner!"
5,"I don't have horses, so I am not using this in the traditional way.<br /><br />Our backyard is being redone and all the fences are down.  With a pool there, though covered, I was concerned about the wanderers etc. So this came in handy and it was so easy to set up."
4,This is a great temporary fence for 1 or 2 horses. It is kinda unwieldy and you may need a little help setting it up if you are a smallish person but it works great after setup.
5,"I bought this color for a cake replica of the Stanley Cup that I made.  I was using this color for the very first time and I have to say that it was perfect!  I was afraid that the silver would be too dark or matte, but it had a sheen and was exactly what I was hoping for."
5,"This is the first time I have found a US produced truffle oil that actually contains real truffle. A lot of other ""truffle oils"" just have ""truffle aroma"" (whatever that is) and a lot of chemicals that sound less than pleasant. You can definitely taste the difference as well."
5,These cookies are amazing. They taste as good as if not better than the original brands. I only wish local stores would catch on and carry this cookie.
5,"i purchased Cafe Excellence Crazy Caramel, Flavored Whole Bean<br />coffee it has a very good flavor and would buy again and the price was great"
5,"Great, Fresh coffee beans. Gave as a christmas gift. We all had some of it and loved it. The smell was great and the flavour was awsome."
5,This gum is my absolute favorite. By purchasing on amazon I can get the savings of large quanities at a very good price. I highly recommend to all gum chewers. Plus as you enjoy the peppermint flavor and freshing of breath you are whitening your teeth all at the same time.
5,Got these luscious wine chocolates to use as part of my stocking stuffers.  They were yummy and a big hit with everyone.  Would definitely buy again.
5,"Very tasty cheese flavor. Because of crunch and small pieces (of mixed size), it goes a long way without adding too many calories. A good buy. Walt B., Apple Valley"
5,My daughter loves these snacks and can't get them in China where she is working now so I ordered them for her. Very satisfied and she was very appreciative.
5,"The Best smooth tasting new coffee we have had since we have been to the Islands,all good as ice coffee."
5,"If you're looking for a very light, refreshing coffee, this one is for you.  Nice Coconut flavor without any bitterness.  May be too light for some people."
5,"I became addicted to eating these the first time I tasted them which was years ago. Once you eat one, you just can't stop until they're gone. They aren't too sweet and make the perfect snack. I love these things!!!"
1,"I've had many types of pepper jelly, and this is by far the worst ever. The price is high, and the taste is not good. The shipping was outrageous. More costly than the green pepper jelly. Don't waste you money."
5,This is amongst the best Karachi Halwa I have eaten. Not rubbery or super chewy like a lot of the other ones...just perfect.. individually wrapped pieces in the box.
5,"I have to eat gluten free, but my family doesn't.  This is the only pasta so far that my kids can't see a real difference.  They like it a lot.  This is one I fix when I don't have time or energy to fix separate things for them and myself.  Because it tastes yummy for all of us."
5,"Good, but I add a cup of whole wheat flour and a tsp. of baking powder along with a couple of TBSP. of Cocoa powder because I like brownies a little higher and more cake like.  They come yummy and with the added flour, they're not too sweet."
5,"Add walnuts to this healthful Brownie and perhaps a light iceing.  Do not overback or it will be very dry.  Lots of good stuff in this Brownie,  but the flax taste is a little strong.  I really feel no guilt when having a Brownie snack for me or my kids."
5,"I made these according to package directions, and added 1 cup of mini chocolate chips, and they were awesome!  They took longer to cook than the box says, maybe that's because of the chocolate chips.  Either way, they were great and I'll definitely make them again."
5,"Of course they don't taste quite as good as ""regular"" brownies but hello?  That's because they're healthy!  And that being said, they are FANTASTIC!  Why eat crap when there are such good alternatives!?"
5,If your not into healthy and into flax seed DO NOT buy these.  They are healthy and they taste like it!  I love them...they are very good.  My husband loved them too.  It's all a matter of taste.  If you're looking for a Dunkan Hines brownie these are not it.
4,We like this brownie mix and I usually use the low fat recipe on it. I also add chocolate chips or something else to it otherwise it ends up a little bit dry.<br /><br />We still buy this by the case.
4,"These brownies are good, but the flax seed texture can be a real turn-off.  To minimize it, I added a little whole wheat flour, splenda and cocoa - BIG improvement and my guests never complained (like they did the first time I made the brownies!)."
5,You CAN taste the flaxseed in these whole-wheat muffins and it's a great taste.  Good chocolate flavor and texture.  I add chopped walnuts.
5,"If you are used to eating flaxseed, then this is the brownie for you.  Hodgson Mill brownies are super easy to make, and taste great.  Since I like dark chocolate, I usually add a little more cocoa."
3,"I was hoping for a health substitute for white flour brownies.  It's OK, but not what I would serve to company.  I substitute canola oil for the butter or margarine and that may have been the problem.  Of course, I wound up eating them all anyway."
1,"first off, i love whole wheat products, and flax seed so i hope we just got a bad batch (and no it wasn't expired, i checked the date) but my mom and i just had some of these and we're not fans. they had an oddly fishy/grassy taste to it kind of like you might get with rancid flax oil tablets. O_o"
5,"I received all the ingredients in a timely manner. All the ingredients were nicely packed and remained fresh through the shipping stages. It was more than I needed for the meal I was making, so I had plenty of left over ingredients."
5,The produce was extremely fresh.  I made a delicious Thai soup with the items and had plenty to spare.
5,"Exceptionally fresh quality and quantity and shipped much faster than expected. I was able to make great Tom Yum soup.  Thank you!<a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000P151AI"">Fresh Thai Produce Kit</a>"
5,I first tried this tea at at French restaurant that had ran out of the usual black tea with mint. To my surprise this tea beats any tea (without milk).. no sugar needed. It is naturally sweetened!
5,Love this hot chocolate--nice creamy flavor.  The price is good and I love the single packs.  This is not a flavor available to me locally.
5,I love the chamomile tea. Its sweet and mild. Its excellent for a bed time tea.
5,With all herbal treatments it is important to understand that the earlier in ilness one will start using them the better.<br />I love to use herbal teas and find them very effective when used properly.
5,"My dog has heart failure and can't have the standard dog treats because of the salt. These are perfect- she likes to ""hunt"" for her snacks, and these are perfect to toss out to her, and let her go nuts.  She really likes them :)"
5,These are a delicious guilt free snack that I always have handy. They are so convenient and last a long time. I also get the corn and mixed veggies which are also wonderful. You can get them at Whole Foods but not at this price.
5,We love this brand of freeze dried fruit and veggies.  They make it easy to have healthy on the go snacks for our 2 year old!
5,Feel like a protein boost?  Got the nibbles?  Don't want to succumb to potato chips?  Here's a great alternative!  Just don't let your toddler try to open the package or your peas will be all over the floor making  for an expensive snack for the dog and a grumpy mommy.
1,"Even though this item is listed under the Gluten free category, it is not.  The ingredients state that it contains wheat protein.  Do not order this if you need GF food.  Bad reviewing by Amazon!"
5,Dogs love this product but it ends up too crumbly and hard to give to the dogs.  But it is really a great product.
5,If you like goat cheese and smoked cheeses you will love this.  It has a very smokey creamy flavor.  Try it spread on crackers with a little black truffle oil.
4,"This coffee is a great alternative for someone who has acid reflux and ulcer problems.  The low acid allows me to still have my caffine for the day.  Maybe not as smooth tasting as my usual blend, but I'm so thankful for it.  Really close in taste."
5,"I've been using this ""low acid"" coffee for a few weeks now and along with the taste, I enjoy not having an ""acid stomach"", especially the ""morning after"".  To me, there is no difference in taste between it and regular coffee.<br /><br />I give it 5 stars."
5,I decided to try puroast over a year ago because of stomach problems and mouth swelling.  Puroast did the trick!  Plus it tastes great!  Couldn't be happier with it (although I wish they would bring the organic decaf back!)
5,"My wife and I tried this product a few days ago. We were not disappointed. The coffee had a good flavor, and the low acid was a nice added benefit."
3,If you don't want to give up the taste of coffee but can't handle the acid try this coffee. Does not taste like gourmet coffee but it does not produce acid side effects.
5,This is a great company.  And the first I have ever seen to offer a low acid option. You can absolutely taste the difference. It's coffee without the bitterness.  Makes it possible to enjoy the purity of the bean without the bitter taste. They also have very cool black mugs.  Love them!
1,"I drink 10 cups a day of Verona, Italian, or French roast coffee, and wanted to try a lower-acid version. This brand of coffee smells and tastes like vinegar. It is totally unpalatable and you are better off drinking water if the acid in coffee bothers you."
1,This coffee tastes so nasty I can't even drink it. It's disgusting. I can't believe anything this bitter is acid free. I actually threw away two bags.
1,"Flavor may be something that has to be given up with low acid coffee, but I decided I'd rather take massive doses of Pepcid and drink regular coffee than subject my tongue to this awful swill."
5,"i used extra yeast and a little more water and it came out very light with a heard crust, which i like. i will order it again. not much of a potato taste but good bread"
4,"I love this bread.  I don't even like the smell of commercial bread; you can smell the chemicals from miles.  I added rosemary, garlic and olive oil to the mix and serve it just out of the machine; it was a hit with my dinner guests."
5,"This was great - so soft, so tasty.  Better than expected.  Perfect loaf every time."
3,I was a little disappointed...I first made the muffins with it and then let the bread machine make and bake a loaf - ok.  Next I will try mixing it myself and baking in my oven.  I do have to keep in mind though that potato bread is dense and heavier than say white bread.  Convenient is a plus.
5,"This is a fantastic bread mix. I do not use the bread machine, I make it in a bowl, hand made, and have had no problems at all. I do not know why people are having any problems with this. It is terrific. Amazon, please keep this in stock. Please."
5,"I like this bread, and several other flavors in this brand.  This one and the seven grain are my favorites.  They bake consistently well in my Wolfgang Puck machine.  Recommended!"
5,This product is as good as any that I have ever used and is so convenient through Amazon as it has become hard to find in the stores.
5,I love these bread mixes. There is nothing like making your own bread. I admit I use a bread maker - not clever enough to use my hands- but I still enjoy the experience. I have tried 2 different Hodgson mixes and they are both excellent.
4,"The potato bread was easy to mix, rises well in my breadmaker, cooks as it should and best of all was very tasty. The bread has a near white bread texture, and was very good. I purchased all of the Hodgson mixes and this was one of my favorites."
5,This is delicious bread and I can quickly make up loaves of bread to eat or give away for a special gift.
5,"My family and I all agree that Hodgson Mill Potato Bread is one of the best mixes on the market.  A loaf of this bread lasts about two hours before it is gone.  It has become a favorite of ours, and we will be making lots.  Don't run out of this one!"
1,"I have made potato bread before with great results but this Hodgson bread-mix is way too dry, it needs some more moisture-don't buy it unless you want really dry bread."
2,"White bread is not my thing, so that's probably why I don't like this one.  I like herby white breads and really full-bodied white breads, but otherwise I always choose whole grains.  This one is not full-bodied and has no particular flavor.  Not interesting at all to me."
3,I am a bit disappointed.  The flavor was not what I wanted or expected.
3,"As a former chef-owner of a restaurant in my younger years, I was  surprised and delighted at the exceptionally good taste and texture of the Bookbinder's White Clam sauce wihtout doctoring.  It is a great product for easy convenience."
5,"This was my first purchase of this water.  It tastes great and the bottles are thicker than most.  Also, everyone likes that name...haha"
1,"Three of us tried it; one of us was barely able to drink it, with ice.  I guess this is, like Evian, an ""acquired taste.""  Unless you're able to try a single bottle before purchase, I recommend you pass."
4,I enjoyed this water.  It was very refreshing.  I find I have some stomach sensitivity with some bottled waters.  I did not have that problem with this water.  Nice bottles.  Water comes from Washington.
2,"Somehow my previous review got deleted. I live in Houston, TX. I buy lots of bottled water-cannot tell any difference between a bottle of Talking Rain and a glass of cold tap water."
1,"Do not buy this if your thinking its only mango.  Ingredient says ""Fruit Juice Blend (Organic White Grape Juice, Organic Apple Juice And Organic Pineapple Juice From Concentrate, Organic Mango Puree.""<br /><br />I cancelled order as soon as I realized this drink had grape and pineapple."
5,I bought this juice because I really like mangoes. It is great refreshing and smooth beverage that everybody in our family enjoy. Will buy again.
5,These are great spices to use on all food types giving a great flavor.  The bottle sizes are twice the size of that found in a supermarket and about the same price.  So you get more of what you would normally pay for.
5,"These are, without question, the best ""diet"" crackers I've ever had.  I've had them with and without salt and since I usually put peanut butter on them, I didn't need the salt.<br /><br />These are great for travel, for kids, and when you just need a very low-calorie cracker."
5,"These stay together better than round ones, which crumble terribly. They are good alone, or with my favorite Artisana Raw Sesame Butter. They are very well packaged which keeps them from getting broken. Also, each package I have opened has been fresh. Thanks for a great product Amazon!"
5,"These brown rice cakes are by far the best, I have tried many. I can not have very many foods. These are my only snack food that I can have. They are so good I dont feel like I am missing anything."
5,"Surprisingly tasty. Thin and crip. Very Cracker like and good for snacking. I got these for my husband who is on a very low sodium diet. These are great for when we travel.  It isn't easy finding prepackaged low sodium foods that taste good, but these work quite well."
1,"Consumer Reports rated these crackers the highest in inorganic arsenic of all the rice crackers on the market. I like these crackers, but will no longer eat them until the arsenic issue in brown rice is resolved."
5,These are not only a good value (health food stores really jack up the prices on rice cakes!) but also are nicely thin and easy to use to spread stuff on.
5,I was able to do so much with these crackers!  they're easy to spread on and stack and put toppings on!  I definitely enjoyed them and so did all my friends =D
5,"Brew it correctly and you really get a beautiful cup of tea.  I highly recommend this brand.  It is by far the best bagged green tea I have found, and I have tried about all of them.  I brew one bag in a 12 oz mug for 2 minutes.  Absolutely perfect."
3,"the clams we're ok overall, quality ext accept only calf the can is filled with clams and the other half is mostly juice. also i expected larger chunks rather than small pieces. product is good though."
5,"This is the mother load of canned clams. Not just a can of juice with a few floaters, but cups and cups of chopped clams. I found no sand residuals,and I was able to use every last drop of juices.Simply devine recipe on the can, best white clam sauce I've ever made..."
4,"These are great beans for the price. If you live in a big city, however, I'd suggest buying green beans at a local Ethiopian shop or even a community Coop. I also remember a Pea berry out of East Timor that was outstanding, but this Tanzanian Pea berry is comparable to standard beans."
5,"I received the K-cups on time and in execellant condition. I usually drink coffee, but at night the Hot cocoa is good with a snack, just before bed."
4,This is the best hot cocoa I've had in a K-Cup!  The taste is smooth and creamy.  It's perfect for a cold morning or an evening hot drink.  I would definitely recommend this product.  The best part is that it can be ordered on auto delivery so I never run out.
5,"I'm pregnant and had to,give up my hot cup of coffee. I thought maybe a hot cup of this will suffice? Sure does! Throw the kcup,in- and this is the best hot choc ever! I choke down my vitamins with it too! Worth it and so cheap here!"
5,This is quite the buy compared to other hot chocolates. The kids love it quick and easy.I will order this hot chocolate again.
5,Kids loved it. Great product at a great price.  My little one can make her own hot cocoa without my assistance.
3,"Even on the small cup setting of the elite, these are a little weak for me.  Make sure you shake the cups before putting them in your machine or they will be way too weak.  I also run a cup of hot water thru the maker before using these so there is no coffe taste to them."
5,"The hot chocolate is my husband's favorite.  Service was also great, as it usually is.  Very popular now with winter coming on."
5,I like the rich dark smooth taste of the Grove Square cocoa. It is the best I have found in K-cups and I have been on auto delivery for at least a few months now. Delicious!
5,"Excellent coffee for people on a tight schedule. My Fiancee fell in love with my brother in law's and had to have one! Now, everyone that visits our house has to try a cup and keeps coming back for more. Also like the fact that there's a wide variety of coffee flavors to choose from."
4,The kids love the hot cocoa and I like the fact that I can get the stuff shipped to me when I need it without worry of order.
5,This was the best purchase that I could have made for my daughter. It was priced beautifully and my daughter can study without worrying about the price for her college books. Thanks so much!!
5,My family loves all three flavors. The dark chocolate is my favorite.  The price was unbeatable.  I will buy this product again.
2,"I found this too sweet. Am hoping there's an unsweetened version available. Not very chocolatey too, kinda like Swiss miss."
1,It has artificial sweetener which not only taste bad to me but also gives me a headache. This should say light or diet to let the buyer know this. I would have never bought it had I known. It seems like it would taste good otherwise.
5,It tastes good and is little sweet so my first thought was that it had a lot of sugar.  I looked on the box and was surprised that it did not have that much. (a plus for me)
5,This is the best Hot Cocoa product I have found for the Keurig K-cup Brewer. The others I have tried do not have the test or alot of the product remains in the cup.
5,"I brew the 8 oz cups, 10 and 12 makes it too thin. It's good at that point but adding some creamer, whipped cream, and or cinamin always improves it."
5,Husband and Grandaughter LOVE this cocoa... Make it for them all the time as I drink my coffee.. My husband is a very picky person but for some reason he really likes this one product and wants me to keep it in stock here at the house.. Loves it at night after dinner on cold evenings.
5,"These k-cups are awesome.  They taste no different (Personally, I think better) than those which are priced three times as much!  I highly recommend this product!"
5,"I have purchased other hot cocoa cups but find Grove Square to be about the best of them all.  I usually add two teaspoons of the the flavored coffeemate creamers, my favorite being the Sugar Free Caramel Macchiato.  By adding the sugar free creamer the taste is there but not the calories."
5,"The most chocolatey and smooth hot cocoa ever, Yum! It has the best price and taste for the Keurig K-Cup Brewer. Way better then at least 3 other peicer brands--we've tried different ones and this is the best and super super fast delivery. Thanks"
3,Makes pretty good cocoa and a lot easier than on the stovetop.  Not as sweet as I would prefer and needs to be stirred to keep it in suspension.  I guess I can add marshmallows:-)
4,"Arrived quick and on-time, and what a great value! Definitely pleased with my purchase, and will likely buy again =)"
5,"Great option for excellent taste, price, and convenience. A repeat customer on these! We order these now in the 36 pack instead of getting at the grocery store."
5,"Grove square Hot Cocoa is just the right amout of milk chocolate, not to much chocolate, just the right mixture. Delicious! I say a good cup of hot chocolate. Try Grove Square Hot Cocoa, Milk Chocolate K cups for Keurig Coffee Makers. Enjoy! I did."
5,this hot coca tastes pretty good when brewed on 8oz setting however its not the best I've ever tasted nor the worst. its hard to rate this because everyone has different tastes so its ether you like it or you don't. I my self happen to like it and will buy again unless I find something better.
5,This is a great buy.  I love this hot chocolate because it is very low in sugar and has a good taste.  It isn't messy like regular hot chocolate as it is all dissolved before it hits the cup.  Would buy again.
5,"Yum!  All the convenience you expect with a K-Cup with all the flavor of real hot chocolate.  The kids love it, and so will you!"
5,I really like the flavor of this hot chocolate.  The kids love the flavor too.  I always keep a box of this in the house as my kids and their friends are avid coco drinkers.  This makes it easier and less messy even for the younger ones.  No more powder spilled on the counter tops this way!
5,This is one of my wife's favorite. Grove Square has another great product to share with Kcup users.  Now we need some specials  to bring the price per unit down.
5,My husband and I both love this hot chocolate. We are on the auto shipment for every other month and we are going to have to change it to every month!
5,My family really enjoys Grove Square Hot Cocoa Milk Chocolate and we keep a supply on hand.  The excellent price is what made us choose this brand but the taste is what makes us continually renew our order.
5,I have tried several types of hot chocolate since purchasing my Keurig and this is by far the one I enjoy the most.  I have it shipped every month so that I don't worry about running out!!!
5,"I liked the milk chocolate version, so tried this.  It is just as good, and with the more intense chocolate flavor, appeals to my chocolate desires."
3,"It's okay but it does not have a rich chocolatey taste. I actually find it to have a funky taste, can't quite figure it out."
5,"the greatest, best chocolate taste in any keurig k-cups out there. will definitely order more. everyone in the office tries to steal them. i'm a chocolate nut, and these pass the test."
5,I have tried different brands of hot cocoa from dark to milk and the Grove Square milk chocolate k-cups have by far been the best.  They're big critics in my family and they have given two thumbs up.  I would recommend anyone who enjoys hot cocoa to purchase this brand.
5,great product for keurig coffee maker. works fine with coffees and cocoa mixtures. Is good for just hot chocolate. like purchase price
5,I enjoy the selection and they have all met my expectations so far.  My sister wioll not try any favor but milk chocolate but I am glad I brought the variety pack anyway
5,This hot chocolate is much better than other k cup hot chocolates I have tried.  It is not watery.  I have tried both the milk and dark chocolate version and like them both.
5,So far Grove Square has the best hot chocolate K-cups.  We have tried a couple others but they don't compare.
4,"When I was talking to a neighbor about getting a Keurig she told me not to get cocoa.  This was in a group of beverages that I got when I ordered my Keurig and I think it is very good.  It is rich, creamy, and exactly what I want when I want a cup of cocoa!  I would order this again."
5,This Hot chocolate is very good. It has just the right amount of milk chocolate flavor. The price is a very good deal and more than worth it!
5,"I don't ven know why i ordered these, it was just on a whim. But what a surprise when I brewed myself some hot chocolate. The taste was unbelievable, just like homemade. Maybe a tad too sweet, but a tiny little bit of instant coffee added to it did the trick. Love it."
3,"I was expecting something more... considering the Keurig does such a good job with coffee.<br />But this stuff? Everybody who sampled it here said it tasted just like Nestle's powdered hot chocolate in a mug with hot water. Watery, sugary, and nothing special."
5,this item has an awesome chocolate flavor. i would recommend this product to anyone looking for hot chocolate for their keurig or any machine that uses k-cups. Great product
1,I was hoping this was a good idea.  However we tried them even after I heard they tasted bitter like artificial sweetner and it was true.  Not the same as the stuff from the can.
5,Ordered this in the colder weather and it was great in the morning. Very easy and fast to prepare in K-Cups.
4,The Grove Square Hot Coco K-Cups have a good flavor but I find that the k-cups do not have enough hot coco mix to make that perfect cup. Thus I recommend putting a little less water in order to make each cup just right.
5,"After drinking Swiss Miss watered down hot chocolates taste for so long, this is a very tasty creamy hot chocolate. My kids love it so I tried it and its the best I had in a while. I will be ordering more."
5,GROVE STREET HAS THE ABSOLUTE BEST HOT CHOCOLATE FOR THE KEURIG.  YOU SHOULD ALWAYS HAVE HOT CHOCOLATE AVAILABLE TO SOOTHE AWAY THE DAYS ANXIETIES!
5,My mom and son love the flavor of this hot chocolate. Add a little bit of milk afterwards and 1 splenda and the taste is amazing.
5,My grandson loves this.  He makes a cup everytime he stops over. It quick and easy and the taste is good.
5,"As far as single serve cocoas go, this is one of the best.  I wouldn't say it's as good as some of the handmade ones, but it's still good!"
4,"nice variety pack. has 3 dofferent hot chocolates in one package. milk, dark and peppermint. nice holiday feel. good for company during the season."
5,I keep this on hand for the young at heart.  We enjoy a cup almost every night.  Good taste.  will buy again.
4,"This is delicious hot chocolate. It is best at 8 oz cup, but can be stretched to 10. And 8oz of strong coffee and you have delicious mocha"
5,I've had many hot cocoa K-Cups and I must say this one is the best by far. The Green Mountain one has a half & half bitter aftertaste while the grove square is very pleasant and is as close as you can get without actually using milk.
5,"I really like this hot chocolate mix.  I was concerned, when I read some of the reviews, that I would not like it but I like it alot.  To me it has just the right amount of chocolate and is not to sweet.  I would recommend this product."
1,"All this is, is artificially sweetened hot cocoa mix that is placed in a Kcup delivery device.  What a waste of money.  Also, Grove Square products are notoriously inferior."
3,"My kids like this cocoa, but I find flavor less delicious than the more expensive <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B003VQXYMQ"">Green Mountain Coffee Hot Cocoa, 24-Count K-Cups for Keurig Brewers (Pack of 2)</a>."
2,very easy to use not the best flavor It has too much sugar and is not a quality I thought I was getting
5,The hot cocoa is delicious and is strong enough to make the larger size. I find all three flavors delicious with my favorite being the dark cocoa.  The best bang for the buck I have so far found for hot cocoa.  I tend to use my coffee maker for everything but coffee.
5,"Very good hot chocolate.  I have tried a few different brands, and this one is the best I have tried.  Should be priced higher for the quality you get."
5,"I've been buying this milk hot chocolate for months now and it's one of the best I've had.  I even got my in-laws hooked on it and my granddaughters absolutely love it!  Great price, great product!"
5,Just what I was looking for tired of going to the store to pick these up and always being sold out! I love the flavor not so sweet and just right!! Thank you! and will be buying again!!
3,"My oh my is this cocoa sweet. Too sweet I'd say. You're better off making hot cocoa from scratch. I bought this because I thought the minty flavor would be good, but it's too sweet. So are the dark and milk chocolate flavors."
4,This is really tasty hot chocolate.  I like it much more than the dark chocolate flavor but that is just my preference...
5,"Good value for the money. These are good. The hot cocoa is excellent however, don't get the coffee cuz its instant!"
5,"Not bad at all when I use CoffeeMate CHOCOLATE creamer.<br />I still like swiss mix made with 2% milk a little better.<br />But as far K-Cups go, this milk chocolate with the Coffeemate Chocolate Creamer is not bad.<br />And currently, it is less than $11.00 for 24 cups."
5,My boyfriend and I really like these k cups. We have tried others and they were kind of gross. These are the ones we will stick with. Can't go wrong.
4,This is a great hot cocoa as long as you read the box and only use the 8oz setting on your coffee make. Otherwise it will taste watered down. Also it is an instant coffee so dont be surprised by it.
3,"The product is not bad, but must brew at smallest cup size or it has no flavor.  Definitely an aftertaste. Watery."
4,"A good cup of hot chocolate...with a couple of marshmellows.  Make it for my daughter every time she visits. She is nearly 60, and she loves it."
5,All three flavors have a nice aroma and rich chocolate taste. Peppermint is our favorite. We enjoy a cup after dinner 'flavored' with a bit of creme liquor nearly every night. It's become a tasty habit.
4,This item had a great price and tastes great. The only thing that could make this product better is if the little plastic cup was recyclable or compostable.
4,"My husband and I really like this cocoa.  I add extra milk to my cup for a creamier flavor, but the convenience cannot be beat."
5,"great deal, especially for the price. Item arrived quicker than anticipated. This has saved me many trips to Dunkin Doniuts as well as saving me paying double the price for a cup of hot chocolate that's just as good. Looking for more to stockpile!"
5,Love them. Hardly notice any aftertaste from sweetener. I don't agree with some of the others that didn't like it...Will buy again...
3,This product is nice and the price is right but it isn't Swiss Chocolate for sure.<br /><br />Just doesn't have that real deep chocolate taste.
5,Wow what a deal. These taste just as good as the expensive brands. Most definately will be buying these again.
5,Excellent product! A tip from the Keurig people: shake the K-cup before using it. This prevents the cocoa from clumping and results in more flavor.
5,My box of Grove Square Hot Cocoa arrived today and I've just tried it. Delicious. Made a big cup [by mistake] but I'm happy with the flavor and consistency.  No off tastes that I can discern.  A little disappointed at high sodium content. Nice to have as fall starts to chill.
5,"I've tried a few different Hot Cocoa brands for my Keurig... And have been disappointed EVERY time, until now! Cocoa brews smooth and full flavored-on either the small cup size or the medium! I add a splash of almond milk and I'm ready to go :) Perfect! I'll definitely buy this again."
4,I recieved a Keurig K-Cup Brewer for Christmas with sample cups of coffee and tea but no cocoa so I tried this brand and I like them but I haven't tried other brands yet to compare with. I would buy these again until I find one I like better.
5,Very good hot cocoa.  And price was right<br /><br />Awesome and passing the word on the item.  Will buy it again
5,I found this brand and the fact that it was dark chocolate made it by far the best I've had for my Keurig.  I will continue to order this particular brand.
5,I really enjoy this hot chocolate with a little fat free half & half for creaminess. Being that I am not a coffee drinker these k cups offer a nice change from tea. The local stores sell this as well but it's half the amount of cups and almost the same price. Buy from Amazon.
4,"I like to brew a k-cup cocoa into my coffee for a nice mocha.  This dark chocolate flavor is quite nice, especially mixed with Double Black Diamond coffee.  Though not the very best, it is good, and the price is right, compared to other brands."
3,Does not have a rich chocolate flavor. Tastes a little watery. Not sure who a makes a great cocoa but this is not it.
4,"Taste was decent, a little sugary, but very creamy otherwise. Very happy with this product. I will be buying this product again. Packaging interesting, as it's a giant box for the product to float around in until it delivers to your house."
5,"Grove Square Hot Chocolate is the best K-cup hot chocolate. I read many reviews before making this purchase, and now I agree, and will continue to buy this brand."
4,My kids have been begging for hot cocoa k-cups and when I found these so reasonably priced I decided to give them a try.  We all loved them.
2,"This tastes like it has artificial sweetener in it and doesn't taste very chocolatey. The name brand cocoa Kkups are better, or just dumping a regular cocoa packet in a cup and running the water through into it is better."
4,"All three tastes rich and chocolaty, not chalky at all. We were surprised how good they are, better than any other K-cup cocoa we've tried."
1,"Just plain nasty!!! This item tasted like cardboard, very watered down and no flavor to it at all.  Very disappointed"
5,"This brand is by far the best K cup hot cocoa not that that says much, but it is thicker and less disgusting than the rest."
2,"Thin, runny, and the fake milk powder used to add ""creaminess"" has an off flavor. Better off eating your ceramic mug."
4,Not too sweet.  The best K-cup hot chocolate I've tried thus far. The kids loved drinking and making the hot chocolate.
1,"I don't expect great hot chocolate from a k-cup, but it should at least taste like there's some cocoa in it. I can't believe how bad this stuff tastes. I tried it 3 times, and then threw the rest away."
5,"Best hot chocolate available for K-cups. Best taste, after taste. Great in any size when brewed. Highly recommend over any other company."
5,"Oh so good. The first cup I had was on the medium setting. It was too sweet. So I had my second on the larger setting and it was perfect! This is a creamy hot chocolate. Add a little milk and and whipped cream, and your set!!!!"
5,"I was quite pleased with e flavor of this product. A good, strong, yet not overpowering flavor.  Rich chocolate flavor. VERY pleasing. I highly recomend this product!"
2,I wish I had listened to the other bad reviews.  The artificial sweetener taste is awful.  I gave two stars only because my husband doesn't seem to mind.  I can't drink this- even if they were a bargain.
4,"Better than expected, but the peppermint flavor lacks a mint smell or taste. This is a good purchase for the price."
1,"I looked forward to a delicious hot cocoa, but was very disappointed with the flavor. It has an awful aftertaste, like the taste you get after drinking a bad diet soda. Also kind of weak, even on the smallest cup setting."
1,"So bad, I returned it. My children didn't even like it, and they are not difficult to please when it comes to sweet drinks or food."
5,"This is the best hot cocoa I have tried for the Keurig.... Rich, chocolate flavor (I used the 6oz setting) and it is not watery.  If you like hot cocoa, and the convenience of a K-cup, this is the one to get!"
2,I bought this for my daughter and grandson. They both tried it at different times and they both said it had a funny taste and did not drink it. Therefore I will not buy it again.
2,"The artificial sweetener ruined this for me... It leaves the fake sugar taste in your mouth and my husband, who drinks diet soda, even noticed. At least it wasn't pricey."
5,Grove Square Milk Chocolate Cocoa k cups are great! I usually make hot cocoa from scratch with milk over the stove. I thought this was easier and delicious. To add creaminess I put in either a splash of milk or a shot of whipped cream--perfect!
5,"I ordered the hot cocoa for my grandson for Christmas.  He loves the flavor and is able to make it on his own.  Delivery was good, I had it in several days but still in plenty of time for Christmas.  Would recommend to anyone."
3,Good flavors in this combo. Not really strong but I will just set the machine on less water next time.
5,Love this brand. Great price with save and subscribe. My husband loves them. Top with whipped cream in a can and I have a happy man. I wish you could buy all pepermint cocoa.
5,I ordered this as a christmas present for my Daughter and Son in law. He tried it the day after Christmas and gave it 2 thumbs up.
5,My wife rates this  5  Stars. SHe is the chocoholic in the family and if you please HER...you please everybody .
5,I love the flavor that this hot chocolate has.  It is very rich and smooth.  Have tried other brands but did not get the results I wanted.  I will definately be ordering from this company again.
5,"I have tried a number of k cup hot chocolates and grove square is by far the best yet!  Very nice flavor, doesnt have the nasty artificial sweetener flavor like a lot of the kcup hot chocolates.  very impressed!"
5,"I enjoy a good cup of Hot Cocoa on occasion, and this is ""good stuff""!!  Not only that but in a time where prices are out of control on K-cups, this product is very reasonable in price."
5,I bought these for my mom and she loves it.  She mixed eggnog with the dark chocolate.  She enjoyed melting pepermint candies in too.
5,"I bought this mostly because i wanted the peppermint hot cocoa, but i fell in love with the milk chocolate one.  The peppermint was pretty good as well...good cocoa!!!"
5,"Sometimes, I'd rather have cocoa instead of coffee at work. This meets my cocoa craving. I do not need to add sugar - just add water and brew!"
5,"Everything you'd want from a Hot Chocolate...creamy, milky, tasty, makes you happy :) I can't wait to try the other flavors!"
5,"i have tried many brands of the hot chocolates but this by far has been the best.  now, i realize it is thousand percent cheaper to just use the package you can buy at the store and add water but if you want to impress than this is the product."
5,"Having tried all the varieties of hot chocolate k-cups, Grove Square's are by far the best.  They are very chocolaty, rich, creamy, and leave very little sludge in the bottom of your cup.  Yum..."
5,"After being disgusted by the brown water created by the Cafe Escapes dark chocolate cocoa, we were THRILLED to find these dark chocolate cocoa k-cups.  Delicious!"
5,"This is the best Keurig K-Cup hot chocolate you can buy. I've tried others, but will never buy any other brand again."
4,This Hot chocolate tasted very good!  The whole family liked it!!!  It is a nice change to make Hot Chocolate instead of coffee inthe Keurig coffee maker.  We wold purchase this again.
4,I have tried a few of the cocoa cups and find this product about average.  Unless you stir the cup the cocoa will taste watery for a few sips.
4,"Reasonable in price, tastes good.  Prefect for Keurig, which can be pricey.  We will probably buy this again.  It is mostly for the kiddos anyway!"
5,"Great product at a reasonable price....my husband's favorite! Loves the dark chocolate although we get the pack of 3 that includes light, dark and peppermint also.  Shopped around and this is a bargain and surpasses the other cocoa k-cups we have tried in taste."
5,"I bought this item for my elderly  Mom, to use with the new Keurig Coffee machine I purchased for her. SHE LOVES IT!!!!!!......I WILL BE ORDERING MORE!!!!!!!!"
5,"This is great hot chocolate.....Not watery like some others and my husband really likes this one.....Thank you.  Pat Greenough, Boise, Id."
5,I've tried ever single brand of K-cup hot chocolate and this is absolutely the best one. It is the only one that actually tastes like the real stuff.
5,"great price for the 24-count, my dad will love this gift since he loves hot chocolate and drinks about three cups a day, quick to receive."
4,"It appears a little watery, but the taste is not bad at all.  If you have kids that are as fascinated by the Keurig as you are, they'll probably enjoy this."
5,"I enjoy this cocoa very much, the children love it and drink it often.  I would purchase this product again."
5,For the price I think the cocoa cups are very good. I will order them again. They are nice to have in the house for the grand children and the holidays
5,Great tasting product and is much better than other cocoas I have tasted in this type of single serve. Job well dont grove square!
5,This is the best cocoa ever. It beats out anything you can buy in the store.  Sometimes<br />I just mix it in my coffee and it's wonderful.  Highly recommend.
4,It's a pretty good sub for the coffee shop version. No mess and the S&S price is great! I like that the box has perforations to remove part of the side so that it functions as a dispenser.
3,"I like it ok, but it isn't anything great. I have a hot water tap and it is just as easy for me to make the powder packs at home at a fraction of the cost. I'll go back to that method and save my $$ for coffee."
5,"This hot chocolate is great am so glad I doubled the order ,you can not miss with this .Now I have quick hot chocolate for the kids and grandkids"
2,"This is much too watery. It tastes very much like the tasteless hot cocoa one gets out of a vending machine.  After receiving the box and reading the list of ingredients,  I've decided not to order again.  This product if definitely not worth the money."
5,We recieved the product on time and in excellent shape. It tastes good and meets our expectations. Thanks for the excellent service.
5,"Everything about the order went great, the Hot Chocolate is very good. I will be ordering this again probaly soon."
3,"The flavor of this cocoa is good, but I found that it was a little too watered down with the normal amount to water. The second cup was better when I used less water."
4,I am amazed how well these little cups taste.  These Kcups taste very well.  This hot chocolate taste great and are ready in one minute.
1,This tastes terrible...  Like putting aritficial sweetener in already sweet hot chocolate.  The best I have tried so far is Swiss Miss Hot Chocolate K-Cups.  Don't think they are sold on Amazon yet...
2,"Had I known this cocoa was sugar-free, I would not have purchased it. I realize that this will not bother some people, but I really don't like the aftertaste of fake sugar.  In the interest of fairness, this did not seem to trouble my nephew!  Just update the description."
2,My whole family(7 people) tasted all 3 flavors and they are sickly sweet.  Very disappointed that product has sucralose.  I wouldn't buy it again
4,"although this isn't a perfect cup of cocoa, it's far superior to the others that i have tried. i will order this again."
5,"This is by far the best K-cup hot cocoa we have tried.  It has a nice rich flavor and with the added convenience of a K-cup, it is easy to have a cup anytime you like. Highly recommend!"
5,"Out of all of the hot chocolate kcups that I have tried this is by far the best one. Not weird aftertaste, and not watered down. Tastes amazing and priced fairly, what more could you ask for?"
5,These k-cups are just what my son wanted!  The price was excellent and the flavor is rich.  I would recommend these to anyone wanting a good cup of instant hot cocoa.
5,I am a big hot cocoa drinker so this hot cocoa I would definitely recommend it has a great cocoa flavor and it's perfect for those cold fall or winter days. Warms you up plus tastes great!
1,"Can't tell you how this tastes, because I read the ingredients first, but it has trans-fats in every flavor. :( The seller should disclose all ingredients in the description. I wouldn't have purchased this otherwise."
1,This does not taste like cocoa it is very weak no matter what cup size you use.I is just not good.
3,"This is okay cocoa. It's not really very smooth, and it's a little watery. I had high hopes, as I love dark chocolate hot cocoa, and the reviews were good. I will finish the box I bought, but will try another brand next time."
3,just got a new keurig and was looking for a great chocklate drink/still looking/this is fair at best/watery and nothing to brag about
5,"I'd never heard of this brand but they were very cheap here on Amazon and I was extremely surprised at how good the Dark Chocolate Hot Cocoa is.  Absolutely worth trying, it's really quite good."
3,"This is the best Hot Cocoa I have found so far, BUT I hope I can find better. It's not real chocolately. Wish it were a bit sweeter but on the whole, I would buy it again if I can't find better."
5,This is really great Hot chocolate. The price is right too. Usually I find that hot chocolate k-cups are weak or watery but not this one. I was impressed. The dark chocolate is really yummy! I will be ordering more.
5,"We use our Keurig every day.  When a friend gave us a sample we went crazy, it is the best hot chocolate ever.  I highly recommend this, it is a treat in the evening to take the place of dessert."
1,Please stay away from artificial sweetners.<br /><br />Some of them actually change the shape of human cells.<br /><br />this has an artificial sweetner
2,This hot chocolate is ok but not nearly as rich and smooth as the cafe escapes products.  We tried it out because they were less expensive but once they are al gone we'll be going back to the cafe escapes brand.
3,"Just tried this for the first time today.  They are ""ok"", but they do have an odd aftertaste.  Not sure I'll be ordering these again.  Also -- the packaging notes that you need to run a hot water cycle (without a k-cup) after making them (I assume to clean the machine out)."
5,"Compared to other k-cup products, Grove Square offers tasty products at a reasonable price.  This hot cocoa was rich and delicious!"
1,this product taste stale and is full of artificial ingredients.<br />NO REAL PEPPERMINT IS IN THIS PRODUCT and to be honest it doesnt even taste like real cocoa is either.
2,"Found my kids actually cutting open the pods and dumping them into a cup to add hot water too.  They complained that lots of the good stuff stays in the pod.  Kind of defeats the purpose of the packaging, so we switched back to packets."
5,GREAT! Hot Chocolate! By far the best Kcup hot chocolate I have found. I use a little milk or half and half and it's so..... good. I definitely will order again! Thanks for the super FAST SHIPPING!
5,"My whole family loves this product, often times we struggle to find something like this that we can all have (some members of my family have severe nut allergies).  This product is nut free and clearly states what the ingredients are."
1,We prefer the Swiss Miss brand K-cup.  This one was watery in both milk and dark chocolate. This is my least favorite of all k-cup brands.
1,"Nice price, and glad to see a subscribe & save option on k-cups. However this was undrinkable in our opinion. Didn't seem to be too watery like another reviewer said, just a bad off taste."
5,What a fun winter treat!  This is a perfect cup of cocoa in seconds!  We like to put a tablespoon or two of heavy whipping cream in the bottom of mug before brewing! A family favorite.
5,"Was skeptical about the quality of hot chocolate from a K cup but Grove Square is amazing.  It is just as good as making it from scratch but without the fuss.  The milk chocolate is mild, the dark has enough bite to make it interesting and the peppermint is perfect for after dinner."
5,"I love these! The price is VERY good...all the flavors are really good! The peppermint one is my favorite and I would gladly take more of that before the others. Though the others aren't lacking at all, I'm just a peppermint fan! Will be buying more when my others get low! Thanks so much!"
5,"I like this hot cocoa very much it has a very rich taste compared to the others I have tried.Just bought some more of these.<a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B005K4Q1VI"">Grove Square Single Serve Hot Cocoa Cups, Milk, K-Cups for Keurig Brewers, 24-Count</a>A+++!!!!cocoa!"
5,I was skeptical about buying this because all of the other hot cocoa items I've purchased for the Keurig have been awful. I was pleasantly pleased with this!  It is simply delicious!  I will definitely reorder!
4,This is a really great K-cup cocoa. I had been drinking the Cafe Express but they have really gone up lately so this is a good buy . Nice creamy chocolate flavor so I switched to this. I found it at Walmart but this price is better  here for the 3 pack. Give it a try :)
5,"For those who do not drink coffee, this is a great compliment to the teas and ciders also available for your Keurig."
5,Super good price and the best k cup cocoa we have found.<br /><br />I am glad I found this for our family before the big cocoa season hits !<br /><br />love it
3,"I didn't expect much from powdered cocoa in a cup, but here's a tip: put on 8oz setting, then add a 1:1 ratio of heated milk. It tastes amazingly good!<br /><br />Of course if you add a little Baileys Irish Cream, it tastes even better."
5,I got these cocoa cups based on my sister-in-law's recommendation.  It has a great flavor and is inexpensive.  Quite a good combination.  I'll be ordering more very soon.
5,This is excellent hot chocolate for those of you that love love hot chocolate- go for it - you will love it to... I would purchase this again.
5,I love the flavor and the speed of this cocoa I drink one at night and each is the same good stuff.
5,I am very pleased with this selection.  I have not tried the other hot cocoa brands for Keurig but this one is awesome!  I bought the milk chocolate.
2,"Thought I'd try these because it's a good price, but the chocolate flavor is not that good. And the sucralose taste is very strong. I like the Swiss Miss Hot Chocolate ones better, even though those have sucralose too, you can't really taste it."
5,"I have searched for hot chocolate for my Keurig, but couldn't find any that were economical to purchase. I found this at a decent price, and was I glad!  My husband absolutely loves this hot chocolate and says it reminds him of his childhood. Try it - you'll like it!"
1,"I have never tasted such a poor excuse for a cocoa drink. It has such a bad aftertaste that I checked the box to see if I ordered sugarfree by mistake! I will toss this  and chalk it up to a loss but if you are reading this, dont buy this brand. Its downright awful!"
2,We bought both brands to try and found this one with much less chocolate taste then Cafe Escapes dark chocolate.  It was also thinner in consistency. Won't buy again
1,"I love hot chocolate and was very excited to find a variety pack, however, these are gross.  Horrible after taste, my kids dont even like them.  Now I have 3 boxes of the stuff that no one will drink.  Very disapointed."
5,"Best K-cup hot cocoa on the market, bar none. Would not be without it in the house, especially with the winter months coming."
4,This is a very mild hot cocoa.  Perfect for those winter evenings or even good in the morning instead of coffee.  We love it anytime.  Next time I will try the dark chocolate.
1,"taste nothing like how cocoa should taste, i'll never touch this again, i'll be trying the swiss miss cocoa maybe better luck"
5,"We enjoy a cup of hot chocolate with our Keurig machine and used to have Cafe Escapes as our favorite.  When I saw the Grove Square brand at such a great price, I thought I'd give it a try.  We love it - it is now our favorite brand.  I will be back for more!"
5,"Had never heard of this brand before, however the price was right for ordering.  Turns out the family likes this better than the Swiss Miss K-cups we had been using.  Will continue to buy, will continue to use.  Don't forget to buy the mini-marshmallows at the store!"
5,My Husband said it tastes wonderful!! Just like you would get in a restaurant....creamy and flavorful! Hightly Recommends this product!
3,"This has artificial sweetener just like the other hot chocolates out there. If anyone knows of one that does not have it, please let me know! It definitely isn't very strong, but I coulod handle it if it didn't have the artificial sweetener aftertaste."
5,This hot chocolate is very good and flavorful. Compared to other hot chocolate that we have tried it is cheaper and we would recommend.
3,"Everyone has their own preferences, I know -- I actually liked the flavor, but my wife tried it and couldn't stand how sweet it was.  To each his/her own, I guess.  But, now that I'VE had a second cup, I tend to agree -- very sweet."
3,I bought this becaue they were $9.99 for the 24 pack.  I could try them for .50/cup.  Other in the store were almost $1/cup.  Overall they are ok/good but you need to run a hot water flush throuhg you maschine afetr each use or there is a potential to have the residue gunk up you drain area.
4,"This is a great assortment and price...I only give it 4 stars because the peppermint is very weak in peppermint, so I add extract. Nice cocoa flavor to all, tho. Reminds me of ""homemade"""
5,"Best one in K cups todate not watery like several of the others I have tried. Will now join the subscribe and save group!<a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B005K4Q64K"">Grove Square Hot Cocoa Cups Variety Pack, K-Cups for Keurig Brewers, 12-Count (Pack of 3)</a>"
2,"there is a taste of sugar substitute, the aftertaste turns me off, I've even tried using a little bit of milk in the mug before hand to hide the taste. It didn't, so i'm just using Swiss miss powder and a little milk to make it a creamier hot chocolate before using using my keurig."
1,"If anyone knows of one that does not have it, please let me know! It definitely isn't very strong, but I coulod handle it if it didn't have the artificial sweetener aftertaste.This has artificial sweetener (sucorse)  just like the other hot chocolates out there."
5,The price was as fantastic as the taste. So convenient to make and no messy powder  that is hard to dissolve. No major cleanup to deal with either. Highly recommended!
5,The kids like cocoa. Perfect when you can't make the kids hot choco. Tastes good too. 24 Count? not bad...
5,"I love a cup of Hot Choc. in the cold winter months. We live in Penna. and it gets quite chilly here. The Hot Coc. is a little sweet for my taste, but I've gotten used to it and enjoy a cup once in a while"
5,My daughter says this is the very best hot chocolate she has ever had! And I love it because no more spilled envelope messes!
5,I finally found a hot cocoa for the keurig that isn't too sweet. I made a cup the day it came in the mail and from the first sip I was hooked. From now on this will be the only hot cocoa I drink.
5,My grandson and husband love to bond drinking this hot chocolate together. I get it every other month.  I can't ever be without it.
2,I thought the Grove hot chocolate is to sweet. It also has an off taste. I would not recommend this to anybody
5,"Arrived nicely packaged and sealed. An aromatic, lovely tea that I love to blend with others to make custom iced tea blends. I love this Oolong orange with fruity black teas. Recommended!"
5,"So fun and great price. This was one of our party favors at my son's birthday party. HUGE hit! I will buy again for the baseball team and group outings. The box is just like the good ol' days, although I remember the prizes were better back then (or maybe my expectations were lower since I was 10)."
1,Arrives $15.06 postage due in a used Friendly 's box. UNFRIENDLY don't you think? Worst service ever!!!!!_Totally unfriendly! !!!aweful aweful aweful service!
3,"It wasn't a bad purchase at just $9.99 through Warehouse Deals fulfilled by Amazon and shipped for free, but took 2 stars off because it wasn't a freshness issue but Cracker Jacks┬« just don't taste the same like when I was a kid back in the 1980's."
1,Ordered this and most of the boxes were stale and stuck together.<br /><br />Checked the expiration date and it wasn't expired.<br /><br />Starting to think they just changed the expiration date and shipped everything that went bad.
5,Bought these to give out as party favors for my son's baseball themed birthday party.  They were a huge hit with both the adults and children.
3,Product was older then I would purchase if I knew what the date on the individual boxes was before purchase. It gives me only one month to eat them all before being outdated.
1,"Cracker Jacks were horrible--stale, not crunchy and tasted awful even though the expiration date on the package had not expired"
5,"I threw my son a baseball themed party for his 1st birthday. What would baseball be without popcorn, peanuts &get crackerjack?! Item was delivered as promised & the packaging was old school, which was appreciated by parents, granparents &the even great grandparents! Item was fresh & taste great!"
5,I ordered this product for a themed baby shower. They went over well and they tasted just like normal cracker jacks. Loved that I could find the box and they fit perfect in favor bags.
2,"Becareful if you plan to use these more then two months after you order them, they expire quick. I can't use these, I ordered them to use in my November wedding but they expire in March :("
4,"If you're looking for a healthier alternative to peanut butter (whatever reason) this is a good choice.  It's nice and crunchy, tastes better than other brands I've tried, and doesn't separate as much as others.  Best I've found so far."
4,"Somehow I feel healtier eating these things instead of peanuts. I don't know why either. Also, unlike peanuts, I can limit my intake to a handful and not the whole bag."
5,"I have tried all of these nuts and they are fantastic.  I highly recommend them as a snack which is not only healthy, but tasty.  The mulberries combined with chocolate are amazing."
5,A suprisingly delightful snack! Great to have around while I'm working long hours in front of the computer.
5,I prefer jerky with a dry texture but always have a hard time finding a good one.  They're usually moistened soft chunks of meat instead of hard strips.  If you like old-school jerky then I highly recommend this product.  Delicious!
5,I got this for a gift for my father and he loved them.  I will probably get them again but only as a gift due to the cost of sausages.
4,I know -- the description is clear enough about apples & cranberries but I found these sausages to be a little too sweet.  My guests agreed.  The same company makes sausages that I like better.
1,"Original description and order said ""Assorted"" chocolates. What I got--weeks (!) later--was one pack of all white chocolates (the least desirable). Not worth the bother of returning even with Prime. Might be better just buying at local store (same or cheaper price) when you can see what you get."
1,These look like typical sugar plum jellies but they are actually grape flavored. You would assume that they would have a sugar plum flavor. They taste like cheap Kool-Aid and not the yummy Jelly Belly ones I can't seem to find on Amazon.
5,"This coffee is really rich, perfect in the morning. I ordered it for the office, but it was going fast. After a day or so I decided it was too good/fine to share so I swapped it out w/some cheap stuff and brought it home. More for me!"
5,"Found this item quite good: it was sweet and slightly crunchy. All in all, a delightful product. It arrived in excellent condition, no dents and no dings. Perhaps the packaging has improved."
5,"very good corn product, we will be eating this case of corn way faster than we expected.  It was well packed and stores in the pantry nicely"
3,"The fresh tasting Libby's Organic Corn, no additives! I can't believe Amazon can offer such good tasting corn in a can so cheap! But for taste and value, this can't be beat."
5,I combine this with Libby's Organic Black Beans and Libby's Organic Green Beans mixed with Bob's Red Mill Organic Brown Rice at least two or three times per week for a perfect meal every time!
1,"they decided to ship both my order in ONE HUGE box of 24 cans instead of 12 green beans in one box, 12 corn in another and i was barely able to get this inside my house.  then every single can of green beans was dented and 3 cans of corn were dented"
5,These tic tacs are great right up there with the orange flavor. I did find them cheaper at the 99cent store 49cents a pack. I went recently and bought 24 for $12 heads up for anyone living in Ca.
3,"This was a very good price for bulk ordering. However my order was part of some gift bags we were putting together for 8th graders. There was never intent to resell these. Due to ordering limitations, I was unable to order all 300 packs from here."
5,"Delicious and unique flavor, great for those who like a little tart taste. Nice the have a 12 pack since they are pretty hard to find."
5,"When I stumbled across pink grapefruit tic tacs, I was intrigued enough to order them.  I do enjoy grapefruit flavors and I love tic tacs with intense flavors.  These did not disappoint.  They offer an intense flavor that tastes just like real grapefruit.<br /><br />An unusual treat!"
5,"Look no futher. Always fresh! Nothing is worse than stale candy,, so save yourself from anguish and purchase here today"
5,"My daughter and I loved these when they first came out but had been unable to find them locally.  Then I thought, if anyone would have them, Amazon would!<br /><br />So glad to find them - it made a nice addition to her Christmas stocking."
5,"We found these pink grapefruit Tic Tacs while vacationing in Massachusettes; when we returned to California, we couldn't find them! I was happy to find them here. They taste great!"
5,This is a keeper flavor -- hope Tic Tac removes pink grapefruit from the limited edition category.  Citrus flavor seems especially potent to freshen your mouth after eating onion/garlic.
5,"I rarely eat anything but whole wheat pasta, but every once in a while, I eat some of this as a treat.  Almost as good as the pastas that I ate while in Italy!  Just make sure you don't over cook."
5,It is hard to stay out of these wonderful cookies! Just the right amount of chocolate chips and the texture is melt-in-your-mouth good!
5,I don't understand why this dog food is not full of reviews. Checkout [&#8230;] they give this dog food 4 out of 5 stars which beats science diet and purina one which I use to use and diamond natural is less expensive.
5,"Over 90% of dry dog food is very unhealthy and can not even get 1 or 2 stars out of 5 or 6. Diamond Naturals is a great food. I have 6 Afghans and I've spent many, many hours of research to find this out."
4,"My giant Schnauzer was weaned on this food. When we changed to Blue Buffalo, Eukanauba  Lamb and Rice, and Nutro he developers allergies. This is the only food that works."
5,"I don't review much, but I have been buying this brand for my Irish Wolfhound for over 2 years now.  He still loves it and it's good for him.  If you have a large breed dog, this dog food will be a good choice for healthy food."
5,"this food gets an A rating compared to failing scores for many others in the price range. however, it's about $8 more here on amazon than at the local pet store (after a 9.25% sales tax)"
5,My 8 year old Great Dane was itching a lot with the Lamb meal from the big box stores. I started buying this (for cheaper) and he stopped itching. His coat is also looking shinier. I wish I would have discovered this years ago. It saves me trips to the pet store and money also.
5,"I loooove this product .... I use it a lot on my salads, vegetables  and to season meats ..... delicious !!!"
5,"This is a simple salad seasoning, just add vinegar and oil one packet of Goya<br />salad seasoning and you will have the best salad ever.  Also you can put in<br />a potato salad and is marvelous also!<br />please give it a try and enjoy it!!!"
1,"The box has only pasta and dried-up sauce. No TUNA!!!<br /><br />If you can see the words in the spoon on the bottom right of the box, it says, ""Just add tuna"".<br /><br />So the products is making a FALSE CLAIM !!! Shame on you, Annie."
5,Mackerel is a tasty alternative to salmon with nearly the same Omega 3 content. My local grocery store hasn't been able to get tinned mackerel for several months. No one can explain why. So I ordered a case of these and have been pleased with the quality and value. I'm reordering.
5,I ordered these a while back off of Amazon. The mild flavor and firm texture is great. When they are available here they are about 2/3's the cost of my local super market. They are always good no matter where I buy them. I just wish Amazon kept them in stock all the time.
5,The product was exactly as I expected and the same as previously bought in retail stores.
5,"At  $3.33 a can, these are expensive for what they are, but are well worth it. The mackerel are of very high quality, are well packed, and not overcoooked or smoked. Also, since fish is the only meat I eat, I end up having a can almost every day."
5,Ordered 2 cases on different dates and got them within 2 days. Cant find these in the stores so please keep them in stock. Make for a great meal with some veggies or a salad...and this type of fish with omega 3's is good for you.
5,"These are wonderful!  Exactly like the originals, only in miniature form.  Delicious and crispy and the wonderful Amaretto flavor!  Rapid shipping from the seller as well!"
5,This has been a Christmas favorite since my late sister-in-law introduced our family to these cookies over 20 years ago.  She was from Italy and loved these cookies as do we.
5,"This product makes a great gift!  Not only are the cookies delicious, but the tin is attractive and of good quality.  Highly recommended."
5,"A little more money than your average cookie, but VERY much worth it.  You will not find a cookie like this anywhere else!"
5,The best way to get Jelly Belly... a good price.. and you only get the flavor you want.
4,"Very nice product.  It is not a Mounds bar, but it helps satisfy the urge."
5,"I drank this coffee over 30 years ago when I lived in The Netherlands. So glad that I can get it through Amazon. Strong, full bodied but easy on the tummy!!!"
5,"If you have a coffee grinder, this is the best coffee, I would highly recommend it! The taste and aroma remind me of sitting in a cafe in Holland, relaxing and watching the passersby..."
4,"This is a very good, medium-roast, medium-bodied coffee. Brew it directly after grinding the bean to capture the most flavor."
5,this product came as advertized..it was a great buy and I love the taste of the tea<br /><br />great deal and happy i purchase from them.
3,"I paid extra money to have this overnighted to my sister, and it turns out it arrived more than a day late. That's unacceptable to me."
5,I used this flour in my usual pizza recipe. I noticed the difference with regular bread flour right away. The dough was very elastic and easy to work with. The pizza ended up being lighter and crispier than usual. I will only use his flour from now on!
5,Shipping was prompt and the product was what I fully expected.  It helped me be successful with Mama Agata's Lemon Cake where U.S. flours failed.
5,"I ordered this Italian flour after reading an article about some of the issues with American wheat. It is<br />light, and everything I've made with it from cookies to pizza crust has been delicious. It was shipped<br />very quickly."
5,"If you follow their recipes precisely, with careful measurements, the freezer jams are excellent.  Strawberry jam is particularly appealing.  I've been warned that changing quantities of any ingredient will not have happy results."
5,"sweet, juicy and yummy. I have to try hard not to eat too much at one time. So addictive. It tastes just like those in Asian market. Actually this one tastes a bit better."
5,By faar the best dried mangoes i have purchased. Fresh and full of flavor. The 2 pach 20oz is probably the best value. Order a lot because it will be done before you know it. Trust me it is heartbreaking when you reach into the bag and only find mango crumbs.
1,This is not a 20 oz bag.  It is only 4oz each bag.  Misleading product.  Thought I was buying 20oz bags.  Not very happy.  Should've gone local for 8 dollars per bag.
3,"I love these delicious mangoes but the subscription option doesn't ship at correct times. I just received two shipments at once (even packaged in the same box) this week, when one of those shipments was supposed to be for April and I was not notified of that before they shipped and charged my card."
4,"Tasty, slightly different flavors then other brands, but good. In all other respects good purchase. Hard to find in US so I am not too picky."
5,This sauce is excellent for authentic Chinese dishes! My wife is from China and we love to use this product to make Hot Pot and Ma Po Tofu.
4,"I bought this as a gift for my boyfriend and his roomates' dogs. It looked really cute in the package but left the dogs exremely gassy. They are a german shepard, pitbull and a retreiver at fairly large sizes but it was a little rough on the tummy so use lightly."
5,"I use this for iced tea and it is just so much better than American teas - it just plain is!  It is all I buy, and now I get it for others too.  Look no further."
5,I find it is difficult to find black tea in the United States that is of decent quality.  I love PG Tips.  It brews up nice and rich and is reasonably priced.
5,I really love this tea and have found that my daughter and daughter-in-law feel the same!  I've used the loose leaf tea for years but find the convenience of the bags encouraging.
5,"Love this tea...especially love triangle bags more flavor & the tea is what I remember it to be...Happy<br />Came right on time in great shape...Happily enjoying my PG TIPS!<a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001EQ5JLE"">PG Tips Black Tea, Pyramid Tea Bags, 240-Count Boxes (Pack of 2)</a>"
5,"Love PG Tips tea.  It's hard to find in the USA, but a standard in the UK."
5,If people would read the ingredients they would be less critical of the end product.  I only tried them as pancakes and they lent themselves most excellently. I used an Erythritol instead of sugar and they tated great and cooked very well.  I did not even use a blender to mix.
1,"If I could, I would give it zero stars.  I am not a picky eater, but this mix did not rise (can you say hockey puck), was extremely bitter, and not sweet even with the recommended amount of sweetener added.  Save your money."
5,Woeber's Hot & Spicy Mustard is oh so good!  I'll buy another case when this gone.  Makes a great gift as well!
5,It is great! I like it alot. Great price too. I think it is delicious. Top quality product in my opinion.
5,"This is a nice mustard for sandwiches, potato salad, corned beef, roast beef or hot dogs.  I have yet to find a single Woeber product that I do not like.  They are all tasty.  I am glad to see that their distribution range has grown over the past ten years."
5,I started giving these to my daughter when she was 9 months.  She loved them so much her first word was cracker (while signing more)!  They dissolve in her mouth so I don't have to worry about choking.  And they are healthy too.  I highly recommend it.
5,We have to hide these boxes and pull them out when our one year-old daughter won't eat anything else.  She will always eat these.  Her brother and sister are always sneaking and eating them too.
5,My little girl will ask for these crackers day and night.  Bought a pkg of 6 and have used up 4 real quick.  I will be back for more very soon.
5,And they are good for them! With whole wheat flower and no high fructose corn syrup like a lot of other crackers.
5,My 1 year old loves these! Great snack! I've tried to find these at my stores and can't seem to get them very often. Love that they are organic and my one year old loves that Elmo is on the box!
5,"I love these snacks because they are whole grain and organic. I also love the fact that they do not spill everywhere out of the snack cup like cheerios. I have also noticed that they do not leave a lot of crumbs, which makes Mommy happy."
4,"I bought these for my  grandbabies because they are earths best and organic. They like them,but not as well as the cinnamon ones. I tried them,thought they tasted kind of like dirt."
5,Bought these for my grandbabies and they love them. I love them because they are organic. Only the best for my little guys. My big guys even snack on them.
5,"15 month old loves to eat them on the go! They seem great for a healthy, quick, and easy snack!"
5,My daughter loves these snacks and so does everyone else. I try to feed my daughter organic stuff and I'm so glad that Earth's Best makes a variety of snacks that she can have.
5,This is a very good snack that I feel great about offering my 10 month old.  She can easily  pick up the small pieces and definitely enjoys the apple cinnamon taste.  My 5 year old loves them as well!  I would definitely recommend these to anyone with small (or larger) kids.  :)
5,These are the only organic grahams I can find for a reasonable price.  We LOVE these and Amazon makes them a perfect affordable snack for my toddlers.
5,"These are great crackers.  My little guy likes them a lot and best of all, they don't contain any soy or dairy!"
2,"I really didn't notice Elmo on the package? These are for kids more than adults. Nothing wrong with flavor, but priced for kids that scream alot."
5,"This was a new food for my dog, and he seems to have adjusted very well to this product. Thank you, and I wish there were more coupons available for this item."
1,"These cups are artifically sweetened with sucralose - I didn't realize until I tried one, and ended up with a little bit of a headache, which made me check the ingredient list - it isn't noted on the front of the box.  They definitely have an artificial taste, I would not buy them again."
3,"I'm dieting, and I use these as a ""treat"" to myself, when I'm craving chocolate.  I usually brew one of these & one of my coffee K-cups (either plain or hazelnut).<br /><br />For 60 calories, it's not a bad way to satisfy a chocolate craving when you're on a ""calorie-budget!"""
5,Even my kids like this. They are always asking for hot cocoa. Its not too sweet and very chocolaty. It is not super high in sugar or calories so its a great little treat. Enjoy!
2,"These have an artificial sweetener aftertaste. Not pleasant. I would not purchase them again. This the first Kcup hot chocolate I've tried, I'll keep looking."
1,This product tastes like muddy water maybe because it is out of date!?!  I don't know but I'll not buy this again.
4,"Good tasting and the pricing is pretty good. It's always sold out on Keurig.com, so I come here to make this purchase, I love Dark Chocolate! Reason for 4 stars, the pricing isn't great but it's okay."
5,This is a wonderful Dark Chocolate flavor.  Much deeper flavor than the Milk Chocolate.  The Milk Chocolate is good but does not have this deep flavor.  Will be buying this again.!!!
2,These were a little disappointing. The hot chocolate is very watery and the flavor is a bit strange...kind of plastic tasting. Haven't been able to find a good brand of hot chocolate for keurig
1,"After trying several of these k-cups, we threw the rest of the box away.  It only ever created flavorless brown water.  We then tried the Grove Square dark chocolate cocoa k-cups, and were much happier."
5,"This seems to be the best brand that I have tried.  Others have been very weak in flavor, but not htis one.  I would truly recommend this for Moms who have small children and need the hot chocolate after playing in the snow.  Grab the marshmellows and enjoy!  Grammie Smith (6 grandkids)"
3,This product is not sweet enough for me and tastes better with marshmellows already in the cup while brewing. Watery texture was a disappointment.
1,Gross! I tried these thinking they would at least taste like the regular powdered mixes.  The flavor is all fake sweetener (odd since sucralose is the last ingredient) and no dark chocolate.  I am bummed because now I have a box of these cups and don't want to drink them.
5,These bites are 'just enough' for a snack. They are delicious and the price is very reasonable! I will definitely purchase from this company again.
5,"Imagine if you made a craisin out of a berry that tasted like a lemon instead of cranberry. These are very tart, which I love. I eat whole lemons so tart is fine by me. These are not super sweet either, which is refreshing."
5,"Slightly crumbly, but overall a very good cookie.  In my opinion very similar to Chips Ahoy but more airy, less dense."
5,"Like a lot of gluten free foods there is a tendancy to crumble, but these arrived in very good condition.  The vanilla flavoring stands out.  Very good for light snacking or dessert."
5,"son is gluten free, but not fun and tasty free, so these are great!!! I put<br />his icecream on these for a COOL snack.  Taste good to him too just plain."
4,"My husband eats GF, and I don't, and its so hard to find him goodies, and hes always tempted to eat mine. Now he has some thing I'm tempted to eat, I thought they were ok cold but if heated up they really taste yummy."
4,"I am addicted to these cookies.  They taste much better than the regular ones.  The only draw back is, that they should be available in smaller packages - to avoid binge eating."
5,"This stuff is good. My mom gave me a bottle to go with some eggrolls and we were hooked upon first dip. The perfect blend between sweet and spicy, this stuff is so yummy that even people who claim to dislike ""spicy"" or ""Asian"" or any other kind of exotic fare find it delicious!"
5,"I love this sauce. Sweet but hot too. I use it on checken wings instead of buffalo sauce and with pan seared scallops, shrimp. It's very versitile and delicious!"
4,"This sauce is good, but for my tastes it isn't hot enough.  I have had other brands tht have a sleeper heat that makes the sauce multi layered.  This sauce seems to ahve one layer."
4,A really great Sauce but is slightly more expensive than in other stores. It is great for egg rolls or a dipping sauce for many chinese foods! It is also a great sauce to make Chili Thai sushi roll.
5,I've been using this sauce for over 9 years now. It's amazing. I use it on everything from spring rolls to salads.
5,"I made crab rangoon and used this sauce as a dipping sauce.  It was great.  I love the fact that it doesn't have MSG in it.  It has the right amount of sweetness.  It is a little spicy, but just the right amount."
5,"I use this in and on meats, fish, poultry, vegies, all purpose dip et al. It's cheap and very very special. I gave big bottles to family/friends at Xmas years ago and they are all  hooked. You won't be sorry you brought this sauce into your kitchen."
5,This sauce is very good on anything you cook or grill or you can use it as a dip for veggies etc.  It has just enough heat to make everything taste better.
5,This is one of my favorite sauces to have handy. With this order you get two giant bottles which should last a while. The taste of this is perfect! Not for the faint of heart however...
5,"I purchased this sauce as it is the exact same sauce used at the hot sauce bar of Tijuana Flats (http://www.tijuanaflats.com/).  It goes amazing with steak tostadas but in my home cooking, it works wells as a marinade and as a condiment."
5,I had brought this as a dipping sauce for dumplings and egg rolls I made at home. It taste's great and I think it the same sauce I get at some Thai places cause it tastes the exact same.
5,"This is delicious.  It makes a gourmet cook out of a novice.  Put it on chicken, pork, steak...it is ca c'est bon.  I wish I could say it in Chinese.  We love it. We purchase it on Amazon Prime.  Saves a trip to the market. Makes a wonderful hostess gift."
5,The best sauce on the market.  We use it on almost any food product but it is especially good on veggies.
5,"We cook a lot of Chinese dishes in our household and this sweet chili sauce is a MUST HAVE!  One of our favorites is sesame chicken, but we couldn't seem to get the flavor just right... that is, until we added this... YUM!!"
5,"I love asian flavor w/o the extreme heat.  I had this sauce w/ some wings at Mellow Mushroom in Knoxville, TN.  I immediately asked the bartender if he could find out the brand of the sauce for me because it was perfect.  Amazing flavor!!!"
5,"there where plenty of times we had to eat out...but...then came mae ploy sweet chili sauce...now we can eat in whih the same flavor, exciting taste as being at one of the favorite restaurants!!!"
5,"This sauce is something of a permanent staple on our table!! Just about everything gets a dash or two, or three!"
5,"not truly spicy my 2 year old loves this stuff!<br />great on chicken, even chicken nuggets, for spring rolls- the crispy ones and even fries.<br />it's sweet and spicy all in one so very good"
5,"I use this stuff on pretty much everything. Turkey sandwiches, homemade sushi, scrambled eggs, chicken nuggets, and more. So perfect. Not too spicy, not too sour. Not too expensive either. Love it."
5,"Sooo good, I followed some advice and thought outside of the conventional box. Sliced up some cabbage and onion and sprinkled some Mae Ploy chili sauce on it with some Lime juice too, made a nice salad with a kick! also very good with cilantro and daikon."
5,"This is a great multi-use sauce.  Great for using as a baste when grilling - fish, chicken, shrimp, pork, etc."
5,"This sauce is an excellent blend of sweet and spicy.  I love it with eggrolls, rice, just about anything that needs an extra kick.  Give it a try!"
5,"Mae Ploy Sweet Chili Sauce is the best. I use it instead of duck sauce. Check it out. Once you try it, you'll be hooked."
5,"kids love the sauce on many things... great on rice, chicken, spicy & sweet.<br /><br />highly recommend."
5,Tried this sauce first at our favorite place to eat out.  Was very happy to be able to order some for our home cooking!  Great!  Spicy Hot and Sweet!
5,"I love this stuff.  I put it over chicken and even steaks.  It's very sweet, and just a bit spicy.  Just a little goes a long way."
5,Mae Ploy Sweet Chili Sauce is becoming a standard condiment on my dinner table. It has just the right blend of sweet and heat; Mae Ploy enhances the taste of all meat and fish foods. Catsup is almost a condiment of the past. Salsa and Mae Ploy are the answers!
3,These are very large bottles. It is a good dipping sauce with a sweet/spicy flavor.
5,"I have been using this curry paste for several years now, and it makes a great dish. Although it doesn't beat eating Indian out, its the best paste I have used for at home dishes. Even though this is a ""hot"" paste, I would consider it mild."
5,Patak's makes the best curry around. I frequently use it in my Yellow Chicken Curry Dish which is a favorite with both my husband and seven year old.
5,"The Gevalia Breakfast Blend is perhaps the best coffee I have ever purchased.  It is full-bodied, without being bitter.  It also is much cheaper to purchase through Amazon - with Free shipping for prime members.  Cant' beat it."
5,I've tried the other gevalia flavors and this is the only one i like (french vanilla stinks)> Its like your regular cup of coffee that goes with any flavred creamer
5,"Have drunk this as my ""standard brew"" for years.  However, tastes change, and I'm beginning to sense that it's a little on the light side for my maturing tastes.  Nothing wrong with it - it's better than most restaurant coffees by a wide margin."
5,"Stocking stuffer gift for family.  Love this brand & blend.  Full bodied, not too dark, not too weak.  Just right.  This has become a family favorite that everyone looks forward to receiving."
5,Everything that is stated in the information is exactly what I had recieved.  thank you
5,"I purchased this coffee for my grandfather, an old vet and lifelong coffee drinker. He thoroughly enjoyed it and we were able to share many stories over a nice pot of Gevalia. I would definitely recommend this brand, especially this blend, to anyone that loves a good brew. Cheers!"
5,"I tried this coffee two years ago and found it much better then other brands of coffee I had had before. Since then I have been buying Gevalia coffee at Amazon. Amazon offers a good price, even lower than that on the Gevalia online store."
5,"The breakfast blend has always been one of my personal favorites from Gevalia.  Gives whole new reason to getting up early on Saturday.  Plus, the Amazon price could not be beat!"
5,I love Geliva coffee.Its not bitter like some of the brands and it set well on my stomach.I have too say its the best coffee I every had and I tried a lot of expensive brands as well as the lesser expensive this is mid price and I love it.I will continue to buy this frm Amazon every three months
5,Gevalia Kaffee is by FAR the best coffee on the market.<br />Especially the Coastarican peaberry and the Peruvian organic.
5,"Gevalia is the best coffee there is - always mellow, never bitter. I'd never drink any other brand."
1,"I went to check out and found out that the freight is $14.00 on an $11.00 (canned, not fresh produce)??!!  RIDICULOUS!!"
5,I received a box of this for Christmas. It is really good. Not overly strong like most black licorice. It is indeed soft and it has a very simple ingredient list with NO High Fructose Corn Syrup like most candy:<br />Molasses<br />Wheat Flour<br />Licorice Extract<br />Natural Flavor (Aniseed Oil)
5,"This is the best licorice ever!  Or at least the best I've ever had or can conceive of.  The only problem is that now that my 12-pack is gone, it's hard to concentrate on my work as I go through Panda withdrawal and cannot think of anything but Panda."
5,"This is real licorice. It is soft, has great taste, and is very healthy! Love it."
5,I have been eating Panda Licorice for a number of years and it is hard for someone who loves licorice to eat any other brand.  This is all natural (which is what makes it taste great) from the licorice root.  Fresh always because of the unique packaging and the most flavorful.
5,"THESE CHEWS ARE TASTY AND CHEWY. THE PRICE IS EXCELLENT FOR WHAT YOU GET. WE HAVE PLENTY AROUND FOR OURSELVES AND TO SHARE WITH FAMILY. GREAT TREAT FOR LITTLE KIDS.<br />PLUS THEY ARE GOOD FOR YOU WITH NO ADDED JUNK. JUST LICORICE.<br />GREAT BUY, GREAT TASTE."
5,This is what black licorice should taste like!  No artificial off-flavor.  No nasty artificial black dye to coat your tongue and teeth.  Wonderfully soft and chewy.  I took a box into work and everyone agreed that it was the best black licorice that they had ever tasted.
5,My daughter and I were looking for some real licorice and after reading several reviews about different brands of licorice we ordered the Panda licorice. We are very happy with Panda and will order again soon.
5,"This is the best licorice in the USA. If you have a craving for something sweet, this is it. And so good for you. I Love it and the price is very reasonable. i will continue to order this product. It is always fresh."
5,"I, myself, do not care for licorice but my husband thinks this is the best licorice he has ever had and he loves the stuff.  I have also given it to two friends who are licorice lovers and they say it is delicious."
5,Panda All Natural Soft Licorice is a great snack for family movie time.<br />We consume it like it was water. It's the best snack next to popcorn.
5,This all natural licorice is very good -- I highly recommend it.  I bought this as I a read natural licorice is good for an upset stomach.
5,This is by far my favorite black licorice - and the list of ingred. could not possibly be shorter or better!  Now if I could learn how to NOT eat the whole box in one sitting...
5,"Quality and delicious licorice! And this is the best price/oz I could find for quality licorice anywhere. Highly recommended, if you're into buying $30 worth of candy. (You can subscribe for the lower price and then unsubscribe no problem)"
5,I got the licorice at a cheese shop in New York and by the time I got home it was all gone. So got on the computer and found and bought some. That's how much I liked it. I have not done the before and do not regret buying it. Yummmmmm.
5,"If you liked licorice as a child, this is a dream come true.  It is soft, and the taste rolls off the back of your tongue---but you can't eat just one (box)."
5,"I love this licorice and as someone with a lot of food allergies, I appreciate that it only has four ingredients."
4,"The Panda black licorice is an excellent product.  The raspberry flavor tastes mostly like molasses.  This is fine if you value an all natural product, but it is not what I expected.  The two flavors that I bought have all been consumed so they tasted good."
5,This is by far my favorite licorice....to the point I have a case delivered on a regular monthly basis......an option offered by Amazon......a VERY convenient service......
5,this product comes from finland and is an all natural product that is always fresh and I have never tasted better licorice in my life.  This product arrived fast in a protective box and the price is great.  I will purchase another case now.
5,Nothing but good feedback from everyone. A very good classic tasting licorice product. We buy it on subscription and save shipping and a little money.
5,I love these licorice.  Get licorice flavor--not just sugar with some flavor.  Very satisfying.
5,"I sent the Panda licorice to my brother-in-law who really knows his licorice.  He usually buys it by mail specially from one company.  His comment was ""delicious""."
5,This licorice is great.  It taste like the old fashion rope licorice. I will continue to buy it.
5,"I have been enjoying this product for some time.  I buy it at Wegmans grocery store, I believe the cost is under $4.00 a box.  If you like black licorice you will love this product."
5,I am a fan of black licorice.  PANDA black licorice is simply the best black licorice that I have ever eaten!  Well done PANDA!
3,"Panda has good flavor but the texture and shape is not the best. It does not have enough chew and I find it a bit dry.<br /><br /> I much prefer RJ's with it's big solid tubes and excellent natural licorice flavor and satisfying, just right chew without being gummy."
4,"Not the best I've ever had, but good. The best I've had was expensive and from an English company (I can't remember the name). But this is better than the movie kind. They're not quite as moist and rich as the best ones I've tried."
3,"I've found a new licorice,,this one is ok.,But I really don't need the extra sodium in my body...."
5,"Wimpy coffee drinkers beware, this is not the bean for you.<br />If you like strong, bold flavor, you have found it in Larry's.  What a great coffee,<br />Starbucks move over, Larry is in first place!!"
5,i'm not much of a candy eater but these suckers are fantastic. sweet and long lasting. my whole family is addicted to this great treat
5,"I have been looking for a nice strong rose tea, and this is the one!  I've tried a number of brands, but they weren't ""rosy"" enough for me.  This is an excellent tea with a strong rose flavor.  No bitterness - nice and smooth.  I highly recommend this tea!"
5,"the aroma is amazing, like a walk in my rose garden, minus the bees...but add a little honey in the tea and there you are. Beautiful. Taste is smooth, full, delicious."
5,"There are two types of larger suckers sold on Amazon, I got the tropical ones this time. Just as good as the regular kind. These ones have a mixture of sour and sweeter parts. Well worth the money."
5,"These Mega lollies are the best i eat 10 a day so they go quickly, i'm not going to tell you how many ive bought since Jan. 1 this year. They are great i love them."
5,I am addicted to this candy. Will try not to order another batch for awhile!!! This is my candy to eat on the ride home from work in traffic to keep me calm.
2,Although this coffee tastes fine there is nowhere enough coffee in the pod.  The cup that is brewed even with a smaller amount of water is weak and watery.
4,The Parisian Cafe blend is wonderful but it is too thick to fit correctly in the Senseo machine.  The box advertises universal fit but it is not.
5,"Coffee has a great flavor and is not too acidic. Fits perfectly in out ""Juan Valdez"" pod maker that was purchased at Target several years ago! So hard to find these so was glad to find them on Amazon!"
4,"Smooth coffee, but a bit to big for senseo, interestingly all the other Melitta One pod flavors fit just fine in senseo, my fav are french kisses and vanilla haze."
1,My husband didn't care for this coffee at all.  He complained it lacked flavor and aroma.
5,"We love Melitta coffee pods.  Makes a perfect cup of coffee every time. The coffee is always delicious, even the decaf blend!  If you have a coffee pod machine, try all of their blends...they're great!"
5,I love coffee and at night really miss out if I don't have the decaff.
5,"This decaf pod has wonderful flavor.  It is much better than their previous decaf ""Skip the Buzz"".  I'm glad they upgraded their product."
3,"Melitta pods are full flavored; however, they do not fit my senseo coffee machine.  One pod in a two pod holder is too small and two pods are too large.  Sure do wish senseo was still readily available in the super markets!"
2,To make a decent cup of coffee I have to use two pods at a time. I prefer a strong cup of coffee even if it IS decaf.<br />What happened to Senseo decaf?
5,this was delicious coffee for a great price which i could not find at any store in my area or areas nearby
5,Enjoying my Java Pods very much. Easy and fast. Medium strong to wake me up. I get positive comments on the convenience of making coffee.
5,Melitta Pods are an inexpensive alternative to k-cups  that also save in the amount of material you have to throw away. Buyer Beware: Pods vary GREATLY in the amount of coffee they have in them. These allow for a good size cup of coffee.
5,I've been using these for a couple of years now. I highly recommend these if you only need 1 cup of coffee.
5,This is one of the best decaf coffee's I have ever had.  I was ordering this product from another website but found that Amazon's subscribe and safe plan is the most economical.  Great Product.
3,"A decent, clean, and simple cup of morning decaf. I find pre-wetting the pod helps extract a little extra flavor."
3,Parisian Cafe' was not may favorite blend for breakfast coffee.  I prefer others of the Melitta brand.
5,"I love peppermint, but find hard candy just too strong.  These melt in your mouth and aren't overwhelming and don't leave an aftertaste."
1,"I can get it at Walmart for $1.78 each or the gas station for $3.50 for 2. Why, just why?"
5,We bought this to use with recipes for our Tagine.  This is an amazing spice and at an excellent price! Will buy from again
5,I love the taste of this ras el hanout in my rice cooker for brown rice and quinoa. It makes the meal so much more special. Large size too that will last awhile.
5,"This is a nice, complex spice blend that makes Moroccan food, but it can also very easily be used to give body to a quick ""I don't know what to fix for supper"" kind of dish.  It's a great emergency item to have in the cupboard!"
4,"This spice can be tricky to get good quality and this one arrived quick and the flavors are spot on, use it to marinate fish or chicken then grill it, love it!"
5,"<a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000GEVGXA"">Goccia Black Truffle Oil from Italy</a><br />i highly recommend this product, for the price, the qaulity is exceptional.  It brings on a strong 'sense of euphoria'"
4,This black truffle oil from Italy is fabulous.  It's strong and subtle at the same time.  It's the best deal for exceptional flavor.
5,"We have used this for all types of baking, including cakes, biscuits, and cookies.  It works great and is every bit as good as crisco.  Buy Organic!"
5,"This makes the best tortillas.  That is about all I use this for, so it lasts me awhile.<br />Mine cost about 1/2 the price as listed here, but it was on sale where I bought it too."
5,"A fabulous variety of hot sauces with a range of flavors and heat. I bought it for a gift for my brother so I ended up sampling, using them myself. Truly flavorful! And hot! I use it in my omelets. Burritos. Nachos. Beans."
3,I am a casual sauce user and the taste of these sauces was just OK.  Nothing special...  The insanity hot sauce was fun to try though.  I probably would not purchase again since they are pretty darn expensive.
5,"For the guy who love to saucethings up, here's the perfect gift and he will love the wooden crate packaging! Great idea and perfect gift :)"
4,"My son loved all the sauces.  The only sauce that was way too hot was the Insanity Sauce, use a teensy tiny bit when using."
5,"Excellent Customer Service, Quick Ship, VERY well packed merchandise. My new supplier of all things HOT!."
5,I have been searching for an acceptable alternative to the Penrose sausages for years and have eaten many mediocre and gross sausages. This is the best Penrose substitute that I have found.
5,These eggs are soo good i think im addicted they are so yummy and i cant eat just one i was very satisfied with this product and it was shipped to me so quick said it would take a week only took 3 DAYS!!! im very pleased and will always buy my goodies from this seller.
5,"These are the best Beer Sausages I,ve come across in decades! They taste just like the old time sausages I used to get in bars when I was younger. If you wont take my word for it just ask 3 of my friends!!"
5,"Was exactly what I was looking for. Super fast shipping! A bit on the spicy side,but great taste!!!!<br />Would definately purchase them again!"
1,Tried these the other day because of the low price and regreted it from the moment the jar was opened. These sausages tasted like card board soaked in beef flavored vinegar. Im used to eating Glazier's pickled sausages that snap when you bite them. Guess I will stick to what I like.
2,the product was advertizes as hot sausage;s. the lable on jar say;s [ hot sausage ]. but they not even warm . the sausage;s do have agood flavor but just pickled. we have been serving these type of products at our vfw for year's so i know what i'm talking about.
1,While I gave it the benefit of the doubt confirmation was ascertained on the second bite that it tastes like vomit.
5,"This candy is amazing!  Great tasting chocolate and caramel and still sugar free.  I wish it was for sale locally, but am happy I get a chance to purchase online."
4,"If you cannot eat regular chocolate, these are just wonderful.  YUMMY.  For diabetics and people who are choosing not to eat sugar (plus fewer calories) these are very tasty."
5,It was shipped in a very nice package and I have no complain with the seller. My plant growing bigger and now I am looking for a bigger pot to transplant. It's good....if you are looking for a a workspace plant that needs minimal maintenance this is the plant you might need.
5,"cool! I got it last weekend. I was suprised about the pot size, which was a lot bigger than the regular 4"" pots. About the plant, there is nothing to complain.  Within a week, there are already new leaves!"
5,"awesome! I was looking for this particular plant and homedepot/lowes/walmart didnt have any, I ordered it online a little reluctant - my first even plant purchase online, but it is doing great so far! I am happy!"
5,"This is excellent green tea.  It is just a little spicy and very flavorful.  Green tea is so good for you, you won't even miss your morning coffee.  And..... you are helping children when you buy Tea District Children's Tribute tea."
3,"This roasted green tea was only ""so-so"" to my taste. I've found others I like better since I purchased this. However, it arrived in a box of TWELVE boxes (each with 16 or so tea bags). Way too much! Then I found that we can't return food items, so I now have a LOT of tea."
5,"If I drank more than one commuter cup in the morning I'd probably need to back off the caffeine a notch or two, but this espresso (made in my stove-top espresso maker) is delicious and (almost) worth getting out of bed for."
5,A dark coffee that has no bitterness and is smooth as silk. Always use quality filtered water and a clean coffee maker if you want a great brew!
5,I am now on my last box (of three) of this Gevalia Espresso Roast and have been impressed. It does pack a punch like the other reviewer said. One double shot latte of this made in my Aeropress at 9pm keeps me up until a good 2am in the morning. ;)
5,I love this coffee but I am not sure what has happened to the price lately I used to get this exact product on average for about 15 dollars and the price has skyrocketed to $40.  I am hesitant to buy this product again for this price
5,"This coffee is splendid. I can't say much more. Perfect smoothness, not at all bitter.. just the perfect dark coffee."
5,My husband jut loves this coffee!  I purchased it for him and I actually loved it.  I am a HUGE Starbucks fan but this also does the job for me.  I would highly recommend this product.
5,THE NUTS WERE FRESH. THE CONTAINER WAS FINE FOR THE PRICE. BECAUSE OF THE QUANTITY THAT I ORDERED THE FREIGHT WAS MARGINAL.
5,Koeze Colossal Cashews are most delicious  cashews I have ever tasted and they are HUGE.<br />They aren't kidding when they call them jumbo.  They  are so very flavorful.<br /> Order these and you won't be disappointed<br />(expect you'll wish you had ordered a larger size).
5,"These cashews were what I was hoping for, they were large and very fresh. They met my expectations I recommend Koeze for anyone looking to purchase these especially if they are a gift. I was not disappointed."
3,"The tea was a lot milder in flavor than I was expecting, but still pleasant. The aroma was light. I probably would not buy this again, but that's only because I would like a more intense flavor."
5,"I have fallen in love with this tea. I am a british tea fanatic and Ashby's has superceded my tastes and expectations. Smooth, not to bitter, low tannins awesome taste! I'll take this over PG Tips!"
5,The packaging is so cute on all of Ashby's teas and the tea is exceptional. I would recommend this tea to anyone.
5,"This was a great bargain, worked out cheaper than if I had purchased them at a wholesale discount store plus it was elegible for free shipment...BONUS"
5,My wife uses this and she has no complains. It makes her smell nice and clean and it foams well. great moisturizer inside. I personally don't care for it because it feels slimy on my skin after use. I guess that is the moisturizer working. Very good smell though.
5,"I just started using this product so I think it is too soon to rate; however, the order arrived very quickly."
5,I love this body wash.  It leaves my skin feeling very soft.  It's not greasy either.  Worth the extra money to buy the real stuff.
5,"Great product and great scheduled deliveries.  I get it for my youngest son, who lives in a group home. Not sure what they do with it all, but at least he's clean!"
5,Very pleased this stuff smells so good. My roommies LOVE to sniff the shower after ive been in there. the first one got lost in the mail but customer service sent me a second one and upgraded to overnight delivery. So it gets 5 stars from me.
5,i bought this -4 pack of dove deep wash and three months later i am still using it.<br />i dont think i could use any other product.
4,"I LOVE this body wash!  It smells nice, works great, and feels great on your skin.  Add in the fact that with the Subscribe and Save deal, it is a great value, I'm sold!"
5,Great for stocking up and keeping a few in the closet. I like to buy things in bulk and this was a good deal and smells good too.
1,This product gave me a horrible rash.  It contains both soybean oil and fragrance which are allergens.  They need to list allergens.
5,"I like the item or I would not have ordered it, However, I ordered 100 and 100 was confirmed. When the order arrived it contained only 96, four short. Rather skimpy. I usually like to receive what I ordered and for which I paid full price."
5,"This tea is what it is supposed to be, it is good, the packaging was good, and the tea is excellent"
5,"I started using <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B008EMA3AS"">Lourdes Gourmet Chimichurri Sauce</a> on my grilled steaks and fell in love with it.  Now I'm putting it on my chicken, vegetables & pasta.  I'm turning into a real chimichurri addict."
5,"I absolutely love this product!  I use it on chicken, beef and as veggie spread! Its also good in recipe's for a little extra kick!"
5,These cashews are the best I've ever had and the containers they come in are the perfect size.
4,The content has been consistantly good. The calamares have been tasty. The price was also very reasonable
3,"Watch out for this because I wanted what was pictures however I got different colored flowers.  They use local vendors and it depends on what they have in stock.  The flowers still looked beautiful, but I was expecting the white and pink flowers.  My wife got orange and yellows one instead."
5,These are really great tasting cookies. I like the combination of peanut butter and chocolate. A nice change from the usual chocolate chip cookies.
5,"These arrived fresh and in very good shape, Just like buying from the local store only cheaper and delivered to my door!"
5,"I was looking for snacks to buy in bulk for school lunches and this fit the bill perfectly.  It helped that my 7 year old loves Chips Ahoy, but for convenience alone, this was a great purchase since I have free shipping through Amazon Prime."
5,"The Price is great, The serving is just right for a snack, and ITS A COOKIE. Buy a bunch and they send it to your house!!"
4,"These cookies are both yummy and well priced. I recommend them. Other cookies I like are Mrs. Fields(packaged), Chips ahoy soft baked, fig newtons, oreos, and elf cookies."
5,"This is not a gourmet chocolate chip cookie, but is the best chocolate chip cookie that we have found in the grocery store. It is not too firm or soft, has a good amount of flavorful chocolate chips, and makes for a nice snack or dessert. We have eaten these for years in my house."
4,"Delicious cookies.  I actually thought I was ordering the white chocolate chunk cookies, not the chewy, but definitely enjoyed these.  The only down side, is these seem awfully small."
5,Exactly what I wanted...individual packages of cookies that I couldn't find at a store.  Shipping was only 99cents and came to be in about 3 days.<br /><br />It was great!
5,"I really like the ""crunchy"" chocolate chip cookies . . . the soft ones are chemically softened and, I think, gross.  These have good flavor and are great for trips (although eating anything crunchy in the car is discouraged . . . wait for a rest stop!) and especially for preschooler snacks."
1,I did not know that I was ordering biscuit crumbs. That is exactly what I received. Such a lousy product. It's Amazon's fault for shipping out expires products. Will NEVER order food from Amazon.com ever.
1,"When I eat junk food, I'd like to enjoy it, the guilty pleasure it is.<br /><br />These cookies are neither healthy or tasty.  Stick to Chewy Chocolate Chip cookies."
1,tastes pretty crappy. it's like raw cookies.<br /><br />it's not even like a cookie. it's a squishy thing in a cookie shape
2,"I purchased these thinking they would just be ordinary oatmeal raisin cookies. Wrong! I like chocolate chip and I like oatmeal raisin but these combination cookies just don't work well together. I wish I had read the item listing more carefully. Even my kids said ""Blech!""."
1,"Overall I was not happy with the crumbiness of these cookies. They were way to fragile and crumby. There is just too many crumbs in my bed, how am I supposed to sleep like this?"
3,Skinless sardines in water differ from the ones with skin in oil in that they are somewhat coarse and dense as opposed to the softer texture of sardines in oil.  Not much fishy odor and the liquid is flavorful.
5,"Roland S&B sardines are the best you can buy and believe me,  I've tried them all.  ALSO....Amazon's price is half what I had been paying."
5,Water based sardines without salt is.... awwfuul.  Not bad of a product here--far superior to the types I normally purchase at stores.
5,I've eaten a lot of sardines in my life and by far these are the best. The extra cost of boneless/skinless is worth it cos there is more to eat and less waste.  Love the water packed instead of the gooeyness of oil. Excellent
5,The product arrived on time and is delicious. Thanks very much. The price was very fair. What else needs to be said?
5,I have had to change my diet and now have better health. These are very tasty.
5,"I've tried many brands of sardines. These are my favorite. Even with low sodium, they are full of flavor. Excellent choice."
4,I'm on a very low sodium intake- 300mgs per day- and these are great. Good taste and low sodium. I just put a little mustard on them and yum!
4,"This is a favorite chocolate bar of several family members, made so by a visit to Germany. Hard to find in the States. Glad to know where to get them."
5,"Yum!  I could live off of this stuff.  The peach flavor is refreshing and delicious. It's no longer sold where I live, and I really miss it.  (Can't even get it from Amazon.)  It's just too good to be discontinued."
5,"THIS IS AN EXCELLENT PRODUCT. ID DOES WHAT IT SAYS, IT WILL BRING SHINE AND HEALTH TO YOUR PETS COAT, AND THE DOGS LOVE IT."
5,"I found out about these from a co-worker. They are delicious, low calorie, and pack some protein. Eating these rather than my usual pretzels and chips helped me slim down. I get them by the case now from Amazon since it is a better buy (and my supermarket doesn't always carry them)."
5,"For people watching weight or nutrition,these chips are an excellent substitute for regular chips.  They have plenty of protein as well.<br />Amazon's price is much cheaper than buying packs at the local grocery store."
5,"Just the same thing I use to buy in the stores but for less. Same great taste, same great package. same eveything because it is the exact same thing, Love is stuff. thanks"
4,"I'm a big fan of the carbs, fat and protein balance of these crisps. The salt isn't overpowering and the taste is OK. I've had better soy chips (Genisoy Tortilla Chips) but these are alright if you don't like the crunch of a chip."
5,"Stores are not carrying this product - thank goodness I can still get them!!!!<a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000CMHMUC"">Genisoy Soy Crisps, Deep Sea Salted, 3.85-Ounce Bags (Pack of 12)</a>"
4,"These are the most consistent soy crisps I have had. They are light, flavorful, and always fresh - and usually arrive in very good condition (not crumbs). They are a bit salty, but that's the only point that might be bad - just depends on what you're expecting."
5,"I really love these snacks.  They are low in calories and fat while being high in protein, which is important to me because I am a vegetarian."
5,This has been my favorite soup since childhood.  I was pleased to find it available on Amazon.com at a very reasonable price.  Now I plan to keep a good supply on hand at all times!
5,"I bake, so I'm rarely impressed by store bought cookies. This one, though....divine.  So divine. I don't like heavy chocolate, or dark chocolate, but I like a little chocolate. This cookie is the right amount pastry, raspberry and chocolate, and it's light, like a Madeleine."
5,"My girlfriend and I bought some of this at stater bros for 4 or 5 bucks. Worth every penny. We use this on sandwiches instead of mayo. It is the best stuff. It's not healthy at all, in fact it is really bad for you, so keep that in mind."
5,"I am a mustard lover, I eat mustard on everything.  Without a doubt it is the greatest.  Unfortunately you can only buy in a few stores ""Beaver Honey Mayonnaise Mustard""<br />Maggie"
5,I love this Beaver Brand Honey N Mustard Mayonnaise Sauce.  It is the best combination that I have ever used. Makes a great dipping sause for cheeses
4,"Love this product.  Very flavorable to most anything.  Works great on lunch meat, ham, potato salad, more.  Something similar is sold at Honey Baked Ham locations, but this product is much better."
1,"Great audio, until a few months in it just decides to stop working. Common problem: google it and you'll see. Cheapest construction of any product every designed in the entire world. Feels like a fast food toy.<br /><br />I do not recommend this product. Piece o' garbage."
5,Great USB audio interface! I also own the Shure X2U and they perform just about the same...I wish I would have known that before I spent way more on the X2U.
1,"Cheap: A plastic tube with some presumably lightweight circuit inside.  Never worked right; no user interface, no known way to engage or defeat the phantom power."
4,"Have only had the need to use this a few times, but it has always performed well and consistently. Nice that it has a little preamp so you can control levels - doesn't seem to color the tone in any negative way."
5,"Brought this product for recording a radio program from home. Along with the Behringer<br />C-1 microphone, provides a cost effective solution."
3,"The level from this unit was hard to adjust, and when all was said and done, it was very low."
4,"I have some nice mics round my place for video and thought I could use them to help my skype chats, and for the money it is amazing little USB device."
1,"this does not work on windows 7, tried reinstating software and to no surprise it din't work. This was a waste of time and money. Be aware of this issue."
5,I use this with my Audio Technica condensor. Works great for home recordings hooked up to garageband on macbook pro for rough recordings. Its super simple to use and has a dial for the gain. It's not bulky which is a nice.
5,This people is a must have especially to take xlr over to usb it provides un  interrupted audio flow during recording and provides phantom power. Great invention !
1,"purchased and it came looking new, as i had bought it NEW, but it was actually damaged.<br />customer service with the actual company is awful--as i needed to contact the company itself to return it."
5,"The Icicle is an excellent product, works as advertised. I think it's the easiest way to attach a quality mic directly to your computer.<br />the icicle is a fine ""Plug & Play"" mic interface."
1,"Used it a couple of times over the course of a month, and it worked great! Third time, high pitched noise, and no mic signal coming through. Not too surprising, given how flimsy this thing feels. This is apparently a known issue, just look at other 1-star reviews of this product. 'Nuff said!"
4,This product has worked since the first day I have had it. Tremendous buy for me. I needed my mic to go directly into the computer. Thanks.
5,"I use this to record in GarageBand on my MacBook. It works unfailingly and sounds as good as it should considering my primitive setup. I love the level knob and the quality construction. If you read the instructions and use it correctly, this tool is invaluable."
5,"I've purchased a few of these, and they are very reliable. I've used them with Win7 and OS X. The A/D quality is acceptable for most needs. The limited bit depth and sample rate are probably the only drawbacks."
4,Cheap and works well the only thing is the gain on it is a little low even at highest setting. Other than that ir records well and does what it needs to.
3,it is what is is... and it did the job that it was made for. lasts long if u take care of it but is easily out grown when just starting ur own studion
5,This product works just as advertised!! Guitar center told me the only way to connect my mic to my computer was either an expensive converter box or a usb mic. A-HOLES haha. I love this little gizmo and would definitely recommend it to a friend!!
5,"Works well.  It is slightly lighter than expected, but the quality of the sound is excellent."
1,"I used the icicle for about two hours. After taking a break, I plug it in and my laptop wont recognize it. I did everything I could think of to fix this, even hours of searching google. Nothing. In the process of a return. =/ It would've been perfect if it just worked."
1,"It works reasonably well with condenser microphones.  With dynamics the hum exceeds the signal.  Works with Windows, not with Linux.  The build is very cheap.  Anything more than $5 for this is too much."
5,"This product is excellent for the group of people who have Celiac disease.  A tasty treat for Sunday brunch. The only problem I have, is the cost, but<br />as we all know, being saddled with Celiac disease is not cheap."
5,"So life with a gluten allergy can sometimes seem unfair; however, once bisquick started making this product, things got a lot more equal. It tastes like Bisquick. It works like Bisquick. Hey, it is Bisquick. It just happens to be gluten-free. Perfect pancakes! Enough said."
4,"This replaces many of other brands of Pizza crust mix, cake mix, foccaccia and more.  The only reason I don't give it 5 stars is that it is slightly pricey, but that is an issue of living gluten free.  Enjoy and be creative with it."
5,As far as gluten free products this is awesome.  I use it as a substitute for any recipe that asks for flour.  It makes great pumpkin waffles.
4,"Finally-a Gluten Free Pancake product! Pancakes not to bad, taste like regular Bisquick. the batter is just right, not too heavy pancakes. this was a good price compared to local grocers."
5,This is a very versital product!!!! Love it. My husband must eat gluten free and my kids prefer pancakes made with this!
5,"My son who has Celiacs LOVES the pancakes you can make from these, and so do I...and I will eat them, even though I don't need to eat GF! Highly recommend!"
1,"Been gluten free for 7 years now. Thought we were done with mixes that tasted awful.  We threw it away because we did not like it. For my money, you can't beat Pamela's baking mix. But, the Betty Crocker chocolate chips are the BEST! So, don't give up Betty Crocker, just work on this one!"
5,"Wow... it's delicious!<br />The kids Love it!<br />We made it for breakfast this morning... the pancakes were eaten in no time at all!<br />The only complaint was that there wasn't more!<br />(actually, it was disappointing that the boxes weren't bigger)"
5,Best bisquick pancakes I've ever made!  I think these are better than the original Bisquick pancakes.  My husband even loved these!  I would recommend buying this product!
5,"You won't find a better gluten free pancake mix out there.  As a matter of fact, I much prefer these gluten free pancakes to regular pancakes (and I buy them for my husband).  I love bisquick for this product!"
4,"It makes good tasting gluten free food... but... like most gluten free food, it's expensive and it's got a slight grit to it. I've made biscuits, waffles, and pancakes with it... a friend made some awesome banana bread with it. it's very good for gluten free..."
5,I recently went gluten free and this is one of my favorite mixes.  I used it for biscuits and pancakes and it's very good.  You can also use it for pizza dough and to make fried chicken - it's about average for that.
5,"I could not believe how great this mix tasted...it's like eating the regular one.  It came out soooooo good, fluffy and delicious!!!!!"
5,"I find it hard to express how pleased I was to find Bisquick in a gluten free form.  I have tried countless recipes using mixtures of rice, and potato flour and none of them tasted good.  The Bisquick bisquits are delicious, but unfortunatly I couldn't make satisfactory dumplings with the mix."
5,My son loves these pancakes. Much healthier alternative to the original. I am excited to try the other recipes soon.
5,I find it really hard to believe this is GF because it tastes better than any GF product I've EVER had. I made waffles with it this morning and I didn't even want butter or syrup! It was THAT amazing! I want proof that this truly GF...
5,"This is a great product for us gluten free people.  We use it for everything....From pancakes, waffles, to cookies, scones, cooking."
5,So grateful for this!! What an amazing mix. It can be used to make some of the best gluten free products out there. What a break through for us gluten free individuals who miss REAL mixes. Some of the other ones on the market just dont do the trick like this does :)
5,I've tried many gluten free products on the market and this is by far the easiest and more yummiest product yet!!  Thank you Betty Crocker!!!
5,"Thank you thank you thank you.....I have an intolerance for Gluten and Bisquick is my hero. I have tried some of those other packed product and invested in loads of ingredients to make my own mix but ""Bisquick"" has saved me from myself. Again thank you thank you thank you"
4,"I like the Bisquick, it works great in a variety of uses. Wish it came in a bigger box, the recipes are good on the box though."
5,I love this!  Such a great product for all us gluten free folks!  It works the same as the regular Bisquick. Their website has tons of gf recipes too!  This makes delicious pancakes and 'magic crust' pies. Yummy!
5,This is great as a pancake mix.  It almost has a corn texture to it.  I rate everything by if my son will eat it.  He is super picky and loves the pancakes.  I tried making biscuits with the mix that didn't turn out very well but as far as pancakes it rocks.
5,"Great taste, texture, flavor, and works well with any recipe! Wonderful pricing, too! Gluten free products are so expensive normally! Definitely recommend this!"
5,I received this item on time.  The packaging was great.  The gluten free Bisquick is a great addition to our gluten free pantry.
3,"I was disappointed when I tried this pancake mix. Before going gluten free, Bisquick was our go-to pancake mix, so I had high expectations for the gluten free mix. The texture was a little weird. Soft and dry. I prefer the Pamela pancake mix over this one."
5,I had no idea there was a gluten free Bisquick mix..I made pancakes and they were great and the tea cakes also...
5,Bisquick has made a wonderful gluten free product.  From pancakes to biscuits and everything in between are light and fluffy! Garlic and Cheddar or Cinnamon and sugar is a great addition.
5,"These tasted so good! I was surprised because I have heard so many negative things about glutten free bread products. I would eat these by choice, not because I have to."
3,"This mix makes GREAT belgian waffles.  We tried biscuits and pancakes and we do far better form scratch with a standard GF flour.  It does make seriously great waffles though, and we go GF/DF on these.  The waffles freeze extremely well and reheat in the toaster quite nicely."
5,"We've tried Pamela's (second best), Bob's Red Mill and King Arthur's Gluten Free flour mixes.  For pancakes, waffles, breading, pie crusts, biscuits and dumplings, Bisquick has been the most reliable performer.  We whole heartedly recommend it for those who bake at home but need to avoid gluten!!"
5,"I run a small bed and breakfast, and bought this product so I could prepare recipes for my guests that have a Gluten Allergy and they love it.  There are many recipes on the box, and even more on their website.  Quick,Easy, Inexpensive, what more could anyone ask for."
5,Love this product!  Gluten free products have come a long way. Easy to use. Great for all your breakfast and baking needs!
5,This product is great for pancakes. For baked goods I blend Bisquick (2/3 part) with Pamela's bread mix (1/3 part) for great gluten-free/dairy-free treats. The bread mix makes it less crumbly.
5,"This product has helped our friend to be able to eat again.  She is going to college and finding things to eat has been hard. For her, we send her a supply every month so now she can make her own food and not get sick!"
5,You won't miss your old waffle/pancake mix when using this wonderful product.  I mix it with oatmeal in most cases and it makes wonderful waffles.  Pretty easy to give up gluten with this mix.
3,"It is good. I prefer the taste of baking mixes from scratch, but for store bought, it's pretty good. Much cheaper in local grocery stores. Under $5 per box at my local stores in Chicagoland area."
5,"I have only had this once as banana pancakes so I'm not sure how it tastes without fruit, but it was the best pancake I've had in a long time.  Thank you for making a Gluten Free Bisquick, I will try biscuits with it next!"
5,Thanks to the Betty Crocker people for this GF option. It makes great pancakes and shortcakes for strawberries too. My onlycomplaint is I wish the box was bigger.
5,I really love this mix as the pancakes are so soft and fluffy. Could not tell that they were gluten free. I also made carrot muffins with it and they turned out good.
5,"Due to my kid's food allergies I had to substitute eggs with ground flax with water, and 2 cups instead of one of rice milk, and some olive oil. Made great tasty pancakes!"
5,"I do a lot of ""from scratch"" gluten free cooking but there is nothing that can replace Bisquick. From the ease of morning pancakes to using it in other reciepes in place of other mixes there is simply nothing that I cannot do with this little box."
5,This gluten free& milk free product is awesome! I am able to use almond milk in it instead of regular milk. It is great to have such a delicious & easy breakfast that doesn't make my stomach hurt!
5,"Was very happy that the kids liked these! We all liked them! I bought this mostly for myself. I made them with coconut oil instead of the vegetable oil that it calls for.....it was a yummy, healthy substitute. Will definitely be buying again."
4,"My family loves Bisquick Pancakes, my kids did not notice the difference from this product and regular pancakes. The only problem is the price, I will try Pamelas this week, price seems more reasonable."
5,"It was worth the wait--Gluten Free Bisquick is just like the real thing!! Everything tastes the way you remember it. So make dumplings, pancakes or cheddar biscuits they are all as good as they can be!"
5,"I have missed Bisquick since I became gluten free and am so happy to see they have gone gluten free. I've only made pancakes so far, but they are wonderful."
5,"It was wonderful.  We made chicken nuggets.  It was light and coated the chicken very nicely.<br /><br />I highly encourage you to purchase this.  Taste pretty much like regular bisquick.  Has many uses flour, gravy, pancakes....excellent way to stretch your dollar."
5,"It tough to find good gluten free baking mixes but this one is smooth unlike some that are gritty, and makes just as easily as regular bisquick. It tastes just as good too."
5,"I've tried a few other mixes for pancakes, and they've been awful, but this one is really good. I should buy stock in the co., because people will be buying this product I'm sure."
5,"I made cheddar biscuits with this and they came out a little dry the first time, but i adjusted the recipe and they were amazing. I just added a little more milk and another egg. (we have chickens that lay very small eggs, so 3 of our eggs is like 2 large store bought ones.)"
5,This is an excellent product and I use it just like I used to utilize the regular Bisquick product.It works well with any recipe that calls for flour and quickening.
5,"As tasty as the regular (gluten) product. Only drawback is that you don't get a lot of mix for your money. Half of the box is needed to make their 12 pancake recipe. On a good note, it's nice to have options - by far though, this was the best pancake mix I've tried...and I tried a lot!"
5,This makes the best waffles that I have had in years. I will be glad to see more in grocery stores in our area
5,A great way to make cheese biscuits for the Celiac.  I serve to guests and they cannot believe that my Celeiac husband can eat them as they are sooooo good!!! Who says Gluten free has to taste bad!!!
3,"Rice flour, Sugar, Leavening ( baking soda, sodium aluminum phosphate, monocalcium phosphate), Modified potato starch, salt, xanthan gum, MAY INCLUDE SOY INGREDIENTS"
5,"This is excellent.  This is the best GF mix I've yet to try in over five years of trying it all.  It's not grainy, none of that rice grainy thing going on AT ALL.  The texture of everything I've used it for has been excellent.  This is a winner.  The price is a bummer, but the product is amazing."
5,"I have been using G/F products for the past 4 years and it is good to see more main stream companies getting the religion.  The product works, the pancakes and waffles have come out beautifully."
5,"I love this. I have celiac, so this was the first time I had pancakes. I loved them, so did the rest of the family(they can eat wheat)."
5,"I absolutely LOVE this product - being able to have pancakes was my original goal - however - I made the pizza with it & was absolutely thrilled about the pizza<br />These are small boxes (makes two pizzas per box), but I would highly recommend - I am reordering a pack of three now!"
5,WOW!  Thank you BISQUICK for coming up with a gluten free product.  I tried it and it works wonderfully.  So far I have used ot for waffles (recipe on the box) which were excellent and a baked chicken and SPIKE recipe which was also wonderful.  Anyone needing gluten free products will like this.
5,"I like the ease of this mix. I haven't tried anything but pancakes. They were great! I did add cottage cheese to my mix to add protein, which made them less fluffy but not less tasty. I can't wait to try this mix for chicken. I really miss fried chicken."
5,"This is really a great product.  Works and tastes just like the gluten product.  Our son is a celiac and we have tried a lot of products.  We rate this ""crossover"" brand one of the best."
5,"Not gritty like a lot of GF mixes.  I make the whole box at once and keep them in the fridge, pop 'em in the toaster oven in the morning."
1,"Second ingredient is SUGAR! Need I say more? Make your own bisquit mix, it's super easy!"
2,"I made pancakes and biscuits with this mix and found them to be mediocre at best.  I really tried to like this product, but the taste is just so far off -- for me.  I wanted a break from making things from scratch, but this just was not worth it."
1,I made the waffles and was not impressed.<br />Definitely not worth the expense!<br /><br />It's only redeeming quality was that I seasoned it to bread oven fried pork chops.<br />I would rather have saved my money and made up a flour mix from scratch.
4,"I wish some of these companies would say whether the rice is white or brown rice. I try very hard to just eat the whole grain version of any grain as they are more nutrient dense(plus lower glycemic). I've not tried this yet, but if it was listed as brown rice flour, I would have put it in my cart."
2,"My personal preference is to stay clear of this. I did not like the smell or taste. I was attempting to make pizza crust for the first time. On my second attempt it came out better, but I did not like the taste of it. If I at least liked the taste, I would buy again and make my crust very thin."
3,"The only complaint I have about the product is the price and I wish it were organic as well.  Other than that it's a great, versatile mix.  I've used it for pancakes and cherry cobbler : )."
4,"Just in case you don't know - these are about $4 a box at the store, so anything more than $12 for a 3 pack is not worth it.  This is a great product, though (that's what the 4 stars are for).  The pancakes & pizza dough are great, I make them all the time."
4,This product is so useful in managing a Gluten-free diet!  The inced. price @ Amazon .com makes it all a great buy.
4,This is one of the best GLUTEN-FREE mix on the market!!! It makes fluffy pancakes and light cornbread.  Also it is a great price!  I have had different mixes on the market in all price ranges and this is the best!!!
4,I used the Bisquick Pancake and Baking GF mix to make snickerdoodle cookies.  They were very good and stayed fresh for some time.  Thank you for offering this mix.
1,Pure toxic garbage. Eat poison if you want to. Toxic metals. Go ahead and buy this junk and feed yourself poison. Look at all the high ratings. Apparently people love eating toxic metals. Not harmful? Would you eat sodium mercury phosphate? Enjoy your metals.
3,I love this mix. My favorite of any I've tried. The only reason I starred it at 3 is because this is not a deal. I can get 3 boxes at Walmart for less than 12 dollars but I have heard of some places seriously over pricing it in other states so YMMV.
2,"Now if you could just make it sugar-free also?  I know, I don't want for much.  :-)<a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B004391DK0"">Bisquick Pancake and Baking Mix, Gluten-Free, 16-Ounce Boxes (Pack of 3)</a>"
5,It is very nice to be able to have biscuits again.  I can only say they need to make a bigger box.  We run out way to fast.
5,"We have tried a lot of different GF mixes and when I found this new mix from Bisquick, I decided to try it.  I made waffles for my family and even my kids couldn't tell they were GF.  They almost taster better than my original wheat recipe.  No strange texture or after taste."
4,"I can't say that biscuits made from this mix taste as good as the regular wheat.  But that said, for those of us needing gluten free foods, it's not bad either."
5,I just recently had to go gluten free and have been disappointed by the gluten free flours and baking mixes.  I bought this and it's amazing!  Just like the original Bisquick.  Although it is cheaper at Walmart.
5,The absolute best baking product of its kind---I have tried almost ALL gluten-free baking products and Bisquick Gluten Free is by far the BEST!!!  A little expensive but worth the money!!!!!
5,"For those with gluten allergies, this is great. The shortcakes, biscuits, pancakes taste much the same as with the regular Bisquick. My only problem with it is that it comes in such a small size. Would love for them to box it in larger sizes."
5,This is a healthy alternative to regular Bisquick and works great in any biscuit mix recipe. I will surely buy it again.
4,Was on GF Diet for about 6 months. Used this new product from this old quality company with excellent results. Still use it for variety.<br />A box goes a long way. A little expensive but worth it.
5,this is a great product. Perfect for the celiac searching for biscuit mix or pancake mix that actually tastes good.  Also great topping for chicken pot pie.
5,This stuff makes great pancakes and shortcake that I am actually allowed to eat!<br />My doctor tells me I'm celiac- this was three years ago now. I just hope I can continue to find this Bisquick!
2,"The pricing is quite a bit higher than in the grocery stores.  It is not available in all stores, but I have found it conveniently enough for my purposes."
5,These are really good. I like to make them with a little extra milk so that they are thin. I can't even tell the difference between this and regular pancakes. It's worth the price for my family.
4,"I love that it is mainstream and that it works like bisquick. Not all recipes work the same as regular bisquick though.. so I wish they had more recipes available. It does taste more ""gluten free"" than some other options out there."
5,"Love these! Pancakes were something I missed the most after going on a gluten-free diet 8 years ago, until now... These are fantastic! :-) Thank you for making them. I love Amazon mom's because i get these shipped monthly. thank you!"
3,"The Bisquick Gluten Free was okay, but inferior to the Bob's Red Mill and Hodgson Mill products. Pancake batter, when made according to directions, was watery, resulting in flat pancakes."
5,This product is a MUST HAVE for Celiacs!  The garlic biscuits and pizza crusts you can make are amazing!!
5,Product has similar taste of wheat pancakes without the gluten.  Even other family members not on gluten-free diet like it.
4,Made really great biscuits; even my non-GF husband enjoyed them!  My only complaint would be that the packages aren't very big; I used 2 cups to make a batch of biscuits and I don't think there's even 1 cup left in the package.
5,"Nothing gritty and second rate here!  They are just as good and the only pancake mix we use for the whole family, gluten free or not! They are that good!!"
5,I've never made gluten free items before and I got great reviews from customers for my gluten free coffee cake.
5,"So being Gluten Free is hard, especially in a dorm. But I have gotten really good at making Gluten free pancakes on an electric frying pan. They are super yummy! I also make these really yummy cheesy garlic biscuits. This stuff is heaven sent! Makes food that is reminiscent of ""normal food"""
5,"I LOVE this product! After ten years of doing without, the pancakes and waffles from this product are fantastic! I, too, wish it was packaged in a larger box, but as it is, I don't mind devoting more shelf space to several boxes."
5,"We have been living gluten-free for 5 years now, and this mix is the best I have found!  It makes great waffles."
5,My daughter that is 16 and allergic to Wheat refuses to follow the diet. Until I bought this. Now I make her Waffles and freeze them every few days. I usually get 7-8 waffles out of a box. They are excellent.
3,"Alittle bit expensive for the product I think that it should be the same price as the non gluten Bisquick, and otherwise it's good."
5,"We use gluten free bisquick for many different things - biscuits, pancakes, etc.  Tastes good & lets us serve our kids that are gluten free the same thing as the whole family."
5,I just recently bought Gluten Free Bisquick for the first time.  It has been wonderful.  I have to admit that I am addicted to their pancakes. They are so light and thick and fluffy (unlike homemade gluten free pancakes).  They are absolutely delicious!
4,This product made wonderful pancakes -- I couldn't taste the difference between this Gluten-Free version and the original. I tried using it to make pizza dough to relative success. The texture was a little bit weird but it tasted good!
4,"This mix made tasty, crispy waffles using a standard waffle iron, but the whole box only made 3.5 waffles.  This would be a five star product for me if I could get more than one family meal out of it for the price."
5,This mix makes the most delicious pancakes! My gluten eating family wanted mine instead of theirs! I have Also make sausage balls and biscuits for biscuits and gravy with it! So Good!
5,"This is a great product! Hats off to Betty Crocker once again. They are becoming a more ""MAIN STREAM"" go-to company for people who are gluten free!"
5,"So far, I've only had time to make waffles with this new GF Bisquick, but they were delicious. Sometimes with gluten free products, you have to use other weird ingredients, or processes to make them. These waffles were super fast, easy, and seriously delicious. Can't wait to make other things!"
4,The product is very good. Way too expensive and at almost 5.00 a box to get pancakes or biscuits I was disappointed
1,Bisquick GF is easy to use. Pancakes and muffins are very<br />tasty. The product is quick and easy to use. It makes my day.  Gram
5,I have purchased San Francisco Bay coffee before. I have always found that the quality of their coffee is excellent. The beans are always well chosen and slow roasted. A very high quality coffee at a reasonable price.
4,The coffee was good but didn't have a strong flavor. Wouldn't buy this product again. Nice to try new products and try new flavors.
5,I had tried a small batch of the pods for my Keurig and fell in love....this Fog Chaser variety is just about perfect.  I shall be ordering more beans so I never run out.
1,These sticks definitely don't look like ones in the picture.<br />They are much thinner and IMHO not worth the money. I should have returned it but instead gave my dog (GSD) 5 at a time to keep her busy.<br /><br />I'd stick with the Redbarn or equivalent from another website.
5,Oue two labs love these and they are soooo expensive in the pet stores ($4.50) each. We got these in bulk for under a dollar each.
3,"I have two medium-sized dogs, and these are a real bargain, but only keep them busy for about 15 minutes. Next time I will get the larger size."
1,"Apparently 'regular' size = thinner than standard-sized pencils =(  My chihuahuas finish these in a matter of minutes, when it normally takes them days to consume a thicker bully stick."
5,"Great on any thing from rice to pasta to burgers.  I cant wait until the week end for my favorite over easy eggs, hash browns, and this mix.  More heat than you would expect, have tried a couple other brands, not the same...."
4,"in my opinion these are heads and twos above any pickle that you normally find at your local grocery store.  a lot of nice, sweet, pickle flavor.  I probably won't buy again off of amazon because of shipping charges, but if i ever see them locally, i'll buy a bunch."
5,I gave this as a stocking stuffer to my husband to remind him of our last holiday in beautiful Jamaica.  It has a truly tropical taste that is very unique and yummy.
5,"Best grapefruit soda on the market!! Cost is good, but shipping is expensive. I still buy it every now and then for a special occasion!"
4,I was looking for holiday sprinkles in bulk and lucked up to find these.  I have purchased this brand at Williams and Sonoma before but always in small containers.  I paid the same amount here for the bulk package.  I am very happy.
5,"What a steal!  I make a lot of Gingerbread Cookies during the holidays - large ones - over 6"" long - and I bag them in florist corsage bags.  They look like you bought them at a fancy store.  These decorations are the best and they are so cheap."
5,India Tree products are great and you cannot beat the value here at Amazon.I use these to decorate cakes and cupcakes.  They will get a workout as the holidays near.
1,"While I think this product is good, I'm disappointed that they reduced the weight of the product from 18.25 oz to 16.25 oz. Has anyone else noticed how difficult it is to read the type used for the weight, the 6 looks very much like an 8.  Same size box, less product, hmmmm."
1,"Maybe, I got a bad one.  It's very plain, nothing special in flavor.  I felt like I wasted my time and money. I will not buy this flavor again."
4,thanks for having it sent to me promptly. i was very happy to be able to order it online and get it the next couple days.
2,"I made one for my daughter's birthday party and everyone but her died of uranium poisoning. Still tasted pretty good, though."
5,"I got this for a family member as part of a football themed gift. I like that the basket can be reused. I have had the pasta before, so I know it is good. I don't know how the other items taste."
5,"They're almost gone already, and I'm about 5 pounds heavier, but these candy bars are much fresher than anything in the stores--if and when you can find an outlet that carries them! Yum!"
5,"The Bit o' honey candy that I ordered took me back to my childhood when I used to buy the product.  It arrived in a timely manner, in good shape, and of course it tasted delicous."
5,"EXCELLENT QUALITY AND SO O O FRESH.<a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000E5AO8O"">Bit O' Honey Candy, 1.7-Ounce Packets (Pack of 36)</a>"
5,I was glad I ordered this candy. It still taste like it did 20 years ago.
5,"I was just going to reorder the ""Bit-O-Honey""  Last me a long time and I enjoy eating it slowly in my mouth... Just like a kid!"
5,"love my Taffy<br />She's so laffy<br />Her name is Bit O' Honey<br />She gives me a kiss<br />Oh what, ""A Bliss"""
3,I found the candy to be harder than I had expected.  It came in bar form and it is rather hard to chew but just as tasty--just takes more chewing to enjoy!!
5,My neighbor and I love this candy and it's difficult to find the 1.7 oz. packets in the stores.  So I just decided to purchase a whole case.  They were fresh and great tasting.
4,"This is an excellent candy for those of us who have to limit our chocolate intake.  Each bar is sectioned into six pieces, which helps with portion control--and makes it perfect for sharing!  My only quibble is that it's sometimes hard to get all the waxed paper off the candy, as it's quite sticky."
5,"Haven't had Bit O Honey since I was a kid ... and seeing them on Amazon made the purchase a ""no-brainer.""  And they were as good as I remember."
5,"I hate honey but I love Bit O Honey candy. I really don't taste the honey in them. I like the bars better than the individually wrapped candies because the shape is easier to eat. I like them hard, brittle and chewy, not soft. This is actually cheaper per bar than where I buy them locally."
4,This was my second order of Bit O Honey.<br />The first one arived with the celophane cut and one item missing.<br />I hope Mr. Sticky Fingers found the candy as enjoyable as I did.
5,"Dried berries, still with texture and the quintessential aroma. Pot roast is so much better with half a dozen berries flattened into the breadboard and scooped into the pickling mixture. But in ten years, trying to find them - gee. So now I know to look for it on Amazon."
5,"Again, exactly what I ordered. No fuss, no muss. Arrived on time. Pretty much an ideal transaction. Only thing that threw me was that I underestimated the quantity. (gallon baggie in the freezer, ftw)"
3,"Berries are find, but the package is bad. Unable to open neatly and then it rips open and your berries are all over the floor."
1,Be advised. You will only receive 1 (one) box. They are less than $3.00 in the local grocery store. Will not purchase again.
5,"Love these little peanut butter dipped granola bars.  They are delicious.  They are only one point on the Weight Watchers POINTS system.  Even you were not dieting, these bars are a great and filling snack."
5,"We love them! This is a great 100 calorie snack. I snack on them throughout the day. My husband, and 3 year old enjoys eating them as well."
1,"This product was absolutely horrible!  Each and every bar was obviously old, because it was stale, smelled awful, and had to be thrown out.  Shame one you for even trying to sell such a product!"
5,"I love Pico Pica.  It adds some flavor, and it's not too hot. I eat it at least 2 meals every day. It's good on eggs, it's good on pizza, it's good on vegetables.<br /><br />Really, you can't go wrong."
5,"I bought this product for a friend, but I liked it so much, I'm keeping it and buying a second one for my friend!"
5,I ordered this salt collection for my husband as a Christmas gift. He absolutely loves it and has used it every night since. This is a great gift for anyone who enjoys cooking. I will be ordering the second collection for him soon.
5,What a great gift! I bought it for a couple of foodie friends and they LOVED it. It came beautifully packaged ready to gift. I would totally recommend it.
5,"This is such a great product from subtle flavors and aromas for delicate dishes to smokey salts for hearty cooking, this is a great product for the chef who loves flavor and experimenting in the kitchen.  This is such a cool product!!"
5,this product is great  and so is the company I had problem with the post office and they were right there to resolve the issue this is a great gift to yourself or to others
5,"I got these salts for my boyfriend who loves to cook and love his salt! The stand they come in is wooden and sturdy, much nicer than I expected! The salts themselves are phenomenal and I have already bought the 2nd set!"
1,"Four of the eleven glass vials arrived broken. The product is apparently not able to be returned, so I just wasted 55 dollars."
1,One of the vials was broken when we received this product... but you can't return the product or get a refund.  What a rip off.
5,THIS TASTE IS BETWEEN SOMETHING LIKE FLAX BREAD AND CORNBREAD..... EXCELLENT TOASTED WITH BUTTER AND JELLY...DID NOT RAISE MY BLOOD SUGAR AT ALL.... I LOVE IT.
5,Love these snacks...great for a quick fix as well as a snack that doen't add the huge calories or fat that concerns many! Great taste as well as consistency!
5,I HAVE BOUGHT THIS PRODUCT BEFORE. THESE SNACKS ARE CRISP AND GREAT TASTING. ALSO LOW IN CALORIES. I RECOMMEND THEM HIGHLY. THEY ARE SHIPPED ALMOST INSTANTLY AND ARRIVE WITHIN A FEW DAYS.
5,These shortbread cookies are delicious.  I bought some while in London this summer.  They are hard to find and expensive in USA.
5,"Everything I bought was great, infact I ordered twice and the third ordered was<br />for my mother and father."
5,I sent two Babkas to a friend as a thank you.  He is a big Seinfeld fan so he was thrilled to get both a cinnamon and chocolate babka.<br /><br />He said the babkas were delicious!!!
5,This is a great product. Great flavors and very fresh. I received it quickly and damage free. It is my opinion that this is a great value and I highly recommend it.
5,"At first, I was concerned about ordering Babka online but I kinda missed this one. As I tasted it the only thing I could say was : ""wow"". I will order this again for sure."
5,wonderfully cinnamon-y! i will definitely be ordering it again! and heated up with a tiny bit of butter on it put it over the top in taste.
2,"While the flavor and quality of this chili is great, the 108-ounce can is mostly liquid. The number of servings is listed as 12, but the reality is that it will only serve about 5, unless you add more of your own ingredients as the first reviewer indicated. I won't be purchasing this again."
5,Love this stuff!  I add some diced tomatoes and a pound of ground hamburger and this is great!  I take it to pot lucks a lot.
5,You can't beat the price and taste of this coffee. It will always be my first choice to buy. My husband brought it home one day because he liked the price and thought the the can looked neat. Little did we know it would become our new favorite.
5,"Can't  go wrong with this.  Remember its jingle:  ""Better coffee a millionaire's money can't  buy!""  Always priced right and in this economy that's  not always easy.  Frankly I prefer it over Starbucks where one can easily spend the same amount on ONE cup of coffee!"
1,B U R N E D<br /><br />I read the other two reviews and didn't heed their warning. That's on me.<br /><br />They are 'usable' but they were certainly burned.
1,I can't believe I wasted almost $20 on this. They were burned! They were inedible! It was so nasty and they took forever to arrive!<br />You should take this product off of your product list. Worst product i've ever ordered
5,Enjoyable tea with a refreshing taste.  The 16-count Pack of 6 represents an excellent buy compared to store prices.
3,The flavor is very mild.  We tried brewing longer and using cooler water temp but the flavor is almost nonexistant.  Would not purchase again.
1,Trader Joe's Pomegranate White tea is superior to this tea. This is very bitter and perfumey. Maybe thats what you get when you brew whole leaves and stems . I found it repulsive.
5,"Revolution's teas are superb. Smooth and delicate, each one has been pleasant, comforting and a pure delight. I've tried this one, the pomegranate, as well as ginger peach, Dragon Eye Oolong, and white pear."
5,"Melitta's rich, flavourful product is a delicious treat comparable to coffees with a much higher price tag. It is a plus that the decaffeinated version does not sacrifice flavour. Highly recommended."
5,I love coffee.  I love coffee a lot and really don't enjoy decaf.  This decaf isn't bitter though.  Tastes smooth and brews up very nicely.  Enjoyable to the last drop!
5,"This Melitta Cafe. Collection Riviera.Sunset blend coffee is so full flavored, it's much better than other decafs we have tried, and really tastes like regular coffee! Which is great because awe enjoy aided coffee Ian the Summer so no worries about it keeping us awake all night. Recommended!"
4,"The main reason I drink decaf is to have the pleasure of coffee to go with dessert in the evening.  My caffeinated coffee is drunk in the morning... only one cup.  So this coffee is pretty good with evening dessert since I won't get wound up.  Flavor is good, packaged well, easy to brew."
5,"An excellent, bold, medium blend of DECAF coffee for a special evening. Dark enough without being bitter and a perfect compliment for a light desert!"
3,"I thought this would be a great decaf option, but the flavor is a lot milder than expected. I use a bit more than the recommended amount to coax more intense flavor. A bit better than instant for late night sippers like me."
3,"I remembered that Melitta was a very fine ground, and thought it would likely go well in my coffee maker.<br /><br />But after having a bag of whole beans and grinding it myself, the Melitta came up average at best.  Better than Maxwell House though."
5,I like this coffee. It smells good while brewing and tastes as good as it smells. for a decaf coffee it is very good<br />will definitely buy this at my local store.
5,"This stuff tastes great! I am not a decaf person, but perhaps I am being won over by Melitta coffee - try it!"
3,"If you are truly looking for a decaf that will no longer make your heart race, this is not the coffee for you. It is quite flavorful, so I do recommend it to those who can still tolerate a bit of kick in their coffee."
5,"Great. Not like other decaf, which seems to hav a weird taste to me. If you keep trialing different decafs to find one you like, definitely give this a try."
4,I like the smooth taste of this coffee. It is decaf so not too strong but really not very light either. It's just the light coffee that sometimes needed at mid-day. recommended.
5,Smooth with no sacrifice in taste and does taste as good as regular coffee.  I usually don't have any coffee after dinner and never really cared for decaf but I now have an after dinner alternative and no sacrifice in flavor.
5,I've decaffinated a few times and always find myself returning to caffinated coffee for the flavor. With this product I won't have to do that anymore. The flavor of this coffee is exceptional. It's as full and rich as any off the shelf coffee I've ever tasted. Highly recommended.
3,I'm not sure what all the fuss is about???  I thought it was a good coffee but not better than the store brand I usually  buy.  ..and beings the store brand is much cheaper... I'll stick with it.  It isn't bad coffee but I just don't seeing it being any better..
5,"This coffee has a nice flavor, not too bitter, just a nice round coffee taste. Rich flavor, naturally decaffeinated with water, and it's kosher. What's not to love?"
5,"I'm a big coffee drinker, and this Melitta Cafe offering is rich with no bitterness. Sometimes decaf coffee has a funny, oily aftertaste, but this coffee had none of that unpleasantness. Highly recommended."
5,"Very smooth and I used my own filters. The smell is so inviting, I used my own measurements because it was not on the package.  I used l tblsp. per cup and I worked out fine for me, I like my coffee tasteful."
4,"I do not like decaf coffee.  I think it has an aftertaste.  But, I thought I would give this a try.  It truly surprised me.  There is a mellow, full bodied taste with very little aftertaste to be found.  I will definitely buy it again to reduce the caffein in our household."
4,"This coffee has a more present flavor than the stuff they brew for us at work, yet it goes down smoothly. To my wife and I, that's a good combination. The fact that it comes already ground doesn't do anything to subtract the flavor either."
4,"What can you say about coffee, either you like it or you don't. I liked this coffee, although when I choose to review it I didn't notice it was decaf. That aside, it tastes fine (made in my Keurig) but if you want the kick get the caffeinated one."
5,"This coffee smelled wonderful while it was brewing.  My husband drinks a lot more coffee than I do, and he agreed that this is a great tasting coffee.  We are looking forward to trying Melitta's other varieties."
5,"At last- a decaf coffee that doesn't taste decaf!  Smooth, rich, flavorful, with no bitter aftertaste.  Starbucks worthy (but to my husband who doesn't care for Starbucks, it's way better).  We like to drink this in the evening and it's basically dessert with cream and sugar."
3,"Melitta Cafe's Riviera sunset coffee isn't bad, it just sadly isn't all that great either.  It is not something I would buy again, mainly because I'll probably forget about it."
4,I have been taking this tea twice per day and I am enjoying the way I feel
3,This is part of Dr. Oz's Tea Diet. Works like a charm. I have lost inches already and I have been on it for 4 days.
1,"This was the worst tasting tea, actually the worst tasting anything, that I have ever consumed. I took one sip and could not bring myself to finish the cup. It tasted like dirt, which makes sense since it is a root. The rest of the tea bags are going in the trash."
5,"Dandelion root is reported to aid in reducing high blood pressure, which is why I drink it.  I've pretty much given up coffee drinking and this is a tasty substitute, though one must acquire a taste for it.  At home I use bulk roasted root but these tea bags are fantastic during travel."
4,"I really like this tea, I started drinking it at the suggestion of a friend.<br />It helps to sooth an upset stomache. I will be buying it again in the future."
5,"I love this tea. And it makes you feel very healthy, which is so needed during the Christmas and New Year season.. I haven't used it in one week, and I can soooo feel my body needing a good detox.  I recommend for anyone who has stomach issues, over indulges, and wants to feel generally better."
5,Reveived my item fast! It was exactly what I ordered in excellent shape with safe shipping - i will came back and shop here again.  Thanks
5,"I was pleasantly surprised by the stronger than I expected ginger flavor in this product.  It is excellent, if you like ginger, try this.  Best on hot biscuits!  Update.  I've just reordered, wish they sold it by the gallon, its different, something you can't find locally and excellent."
5,I have tried all of the flavors and every one of them are all delicious! They are great for parties and entertaining!
5,"I had tried these at a friends house and loved them, but could not find them anywhere I shop. They are very good for parties or a weekend treat for you and the girls."
4,"I bought these and yes they do come in plastic bags with a label on each but also included was a five sided box that you can fold together that has a picture of each flavor, one on each side. It makes a cute little colorful box, nice to give as a gift if you put it together."
2,I purchased this as a present but it doesn't come As shown in the picture.  It is little white bags with the flavor written on them.  Someone receiving it as a gift wouldn't even know what it was unless I explained it to them. Will be returning.
2,"I bought this for a Christmas gift, but I will be returning. There is no box or packaging as pictured, it is just 5 white baggies containing the mixes, which would be fine if I was just buying for myself but not for a gift."
3,"I ordered in order to get variety of flavored coffees, and have to admit disappointed in the selection. Several duplicates of ordinary coffees received. Also 2 of the flavors advertised which were my primary reason for ordering were not included."
5,Product was timely delivered as advertised.  There is a wonderful selection of coffees which my clients and I are currently enjoying.  Will order again.
5,"love van houtte k cups. the selections provided allow one to sample coffees from different regions as well as taste the ""flavored"" coffees without having to buy a complete box of each.  Then, you can pick the ones you like & buy that particular coffee..great concept!"
5,this is very good coffee I have been purchaseing this coffee for a long time an as long as amazon carys tiis I will keep buy it I like the tast it has a nice chocolate tast to it
5,I love the subcription option at Amazon and am using it to get this smooth and non-bitter coffee! I love it.
4,I got this at a local discount store for $6. It has an excellent flavor and the only reason I gave it 4 stars instead if 5 was personal preference.
5,My first package came damaged but the first rate customer service department replaced it quickly. The orzo are delicious and easy to cook.
5,"I've used this product in traditional risotto recipes, but it's also excellent to use in things like chicken soup, makes a nice, creamy, thick soup base.  I'm still exploring other ways to use this wonderful product."
4,"If you need gluten free, non-dairy and no egg, pickings are pretty slim.<br /><br />If you use a really sharp serrated knife and work carefully, you can split them successfully.<br /><br />Great for mini-pizzas!"
4,These are ok. I like the sweet potato ones better and both have good fiber content.
5,How can you go wrong with buying these in bulk for less than $3 per unit when they can run as high as $5 per unit retail?
5,"These are great. We were told to stay away from wheat, barley and rye. This is a good answer for us. They a not pre-cut so you have to cut them in to. I recommend them."
4,"Tried this item liked it. This item was cheaper to get than buying at the local store, easier to get and it has a longer shelf life than what i was getting.  Around here driving 30 miles one way is local.  P.S.  These can make great mini pizzas"
1,"The Ener-G English muffins that I received from Amazon were not of the same quality when I buy them directly from the distributor in Seattle.  They crumbled and had dense places that were not really edible.  Also, there were only 4 in the pack instead of 6. I had to cancel my recurring order."
1,"The Ener-G Foods English muffins look good in the packaging, but something in them makes them mushy on the bottom.  This presents a gooy feel in the mouth, and both my husband and I got stomach aches.  Won't be buying this again."
2,"These english muffins are okay at best.  They are very hard to cut and break apart easily making it hard to toast.  They definitely have to have something like jelly or peanut butter spread on them otherwise, do not taste the best."
2,"I tried these for a substitute for a sandwich roll, I couldn't cut them without falling apart!  I ended up toasting them in pieces, more like chunks, and with enough cream cheese, they were only OK!  Tapioca hamburger rolls are the only products I would recommend!"
1,These are not the greatest.  Thought they would be great to have on hand when guest come.  Not so.  They were not what I had expected.
5,"Dried berries, still with texture and the quintessential aroma. Pot roast is so much better with half a dozen berries flattened into the breadboard and scooped into the pickling mixture. But in ten years, trying to find them - gee. So now I know to look for it on Amazon."
5,"Again, exactly what I ordered. No fuss, no muss. Arrived on time. Pretty much an ideal transaction. Only thing that threw me was that I underestimated the quantity. (gallon baggie in the freezer, ftw)"
3,"Berries are find, but the package is bad. Unable to open neatly and then it rips open and your berries are all over the floor."
3,"I've been sampling as many sugar-free chocolates as I can find.  This one was okay but not the best.  I don't think what I got was the freshest either, as it had some of that white coating on a portion of the bar.  The BEST I've found so far is Cavalier brand at another website."
4,"shipping was really good,and i got what i ordered on time. will buy from again,alittle pricy but my little dog likes them."
1,DO NOT BUY!  REVIEW ONLINE!  Looks like another treat made in China with multiple reports of suspected poisoning!!!  Please only buy treats made in the USA!
4,"I love to eat pasta but totally clueless on how to make one...saw this while at the grocery earlier, decided to try it, followed the instructions and viola... one awesome dinner!! note: I did add some parmesan and romano cheese to add more flavor.."
4,"My 4yo Cardigan Welsh Corgi loves these things, and when they stopped carrying them at PetSmart, I had to go here for them.  They seem to be made of good ingredients, and they're the right size for him.  Plus, he loves them and that's what's important!"
5,I HAVE A 7 YEAR OLD SCOTTISH TERRIER WHO HAS SOME FOOD ALLERGIES. NO WHEAT FOR MY GIRL. :) THIS TREAT IS GREAT FOR SETTLEING AN UPSET STOMACH AND MY DOG LOOKS FORWARD TO HER CHARCOAL BONE TREATS.
4,My dog loved these and I think they probably helped with his gas and dare I say his breath too.
5,Everyone here who's tried Exclusive Energy has been surprised by its unique ability to pleasantly refresh!<br />Hope it will become more readily available.
5,"Love the products, both the sugar free and the regular are great. Feel refreshed, absolutely no crash. no after taste. stopped drinking Monster and Full Throttle and started drinking Exclusive!"
4,"Great alternative for those who can't eat wheat. A little bland, but crunchy and crispy."
5,"Based on other reviews, I tried these Kavli products.  They're great low-fat snacks.  These are great with natural peanut butter and jelly between 2.<br /><br />Recommended."
5,Kavli Crispy Thin Crispbread is the right consistency for multiple uses.  The taste is fantastic.  It's fresh and pleasant to eat.  Kavli products are the best.
5,"My wife like these better that the Swedish version, Wasa, as she finds the taste better and likes the thinness of the product.  We will buy again."
4,"Wheat-free, natural ingredients, easy to chew. Dry by itself but is good with coconut oil and/or fruit spread."
5,"I haven't seen these on the shelf for a while now so decided to buy here, although 12 boxes is a lot. They're great with butter and honey. Haven't tried them with anything else.<br />They're very thin and fragile and so whatever you put on them will stand out.  But they still have a healthy taste."
5,I highly recommend this product.  Can't beat the calorie count.  My favorite use is putting natural crunchy peanut butter and blackberry jam between two pieces.  Also great with cheese.  Healthy product.
5,Hard to find on the store shelves.  Doesn't over power the flavors you put on it.
5,"I just tried this crackers and am so pleased.. They are very very thin but strong enough to hold a spread. At only 16 calories per large cracker 3x5 inch size , you really can enjoy a nice treat for under 50 calories. A wonderful find for those of us that try to eat healthy and with some control"
4,Product was as described. It was shipped promptly and I will be consuming it as part of a medically supervised diet..it is the only bread that I'm allowed.
5,"I discovered the Kavli thin crackers in paris at ""Marks & Spencer"" in 1980 and Kavli has been since, ""my bread"" and I was happy, when we moved to the US in 1987, to find them also here.<br /><br />I can say that kavli has been an important part of helping me to keep my weight"
1,"DON'T YOU KNOW THAT SUGAR IS THE SAND OF TIME ?  SINCE THE INGREDIENTS OF KAVLI CRISPY THIN WERE LISTED ON AMAZON, AND THE TIME I RECEIVED MY ORDER,  SUGAR  WAS ADDED TO THIS PRODUCT.  YOU ARE GOING TO GET IN TROUBLE, MISTER."
5,It is very strong and pure! you just need a little bit to get a great flavor. Helps with digestion but the smell is strong!!
2,"This tea has NO flavor, tastes like dust It ""looks"" like quality -- pretty package -- but it's no good. Lipton regular Pekoe is farrr superior."
5,These are so tasty I use them when making my cheesecake cookies and in pancakes there's nothing that they can't be used in. They taste sweet and not overpowering.
4,"Order these with the idea in mind of putting them in waffles, pancakes & a cookiie recipe that I had."
4,"looking for bits as real blueberries seem to have no flavor these days.. these were very good,  Would def buy again"
5,I buy Gosh That's Good Sugar Free White Velvet all of the time.  This is the best SF White Chocolate that I have ever used.  It may be a little expensive but it lasts a long time.  Buy it and ENJOY!
5,This stuff is AMAZING!  Fast shipping and most of all the best tasting sugar free low calorie item on the market.  Bravo!  I use it in my coffee and its a real treat.<br /><br />THANK YOU!  Will be ordering more very soon.
5,Wagyu beef is a kobe beef Japanese cow crossbred with an American cow. It's the best possible beef you can get in the US and is not illegal.
1,"Kobe beef comes from a specific prefecture in Japan and is illegal to import in to the United states. In fact, it has been illegal to import since 2010 in any form. This is just overpriced regular American beef."
5,"really gets the mouth watering, a little over $3.00 at BIG5, the price listed here is insane!"
5,"This is a good deal for a flavor not often carried in the stores. The honey berry flaver is a good thing, not being to mediciny and things of that nature. Yum"
5,"This was a cute, affordable set for my 2 y/o son's golf theme party.  They were a great size for a half sheet cake and he's played with them as toys since his party."
5,"The Golf ""set"" arrived quickly and was just as pictured. The birthday for my five year old grandson turned out great."
3,The set is bigger than I thought it would be.  It would take a very big cake to set up all of this.  I ended up using only the golfer and a ball.  The golfer is about 3 inches tall and the clubs are 3-4 inches long.
5,The BEST sugar substitute at this time. Swerve is virtually replacing sugar in our home. Bakes and measures the same as sugar with no aftertaste. Can't wait for it to go mainstream to be able to buy in our supermarkets.
5,This food is great. My 11 year old beagle loves it and she is much more active since I changed her food. I highly recommend this dog food.
5,We have had trouble in finding dog food for one of our small dogs who obviously has a very sensitive stomach.  We have tried several kinds of dog food for her and Newman's Own Organic seems to be agreeing with her. So we will continue purchasing this product through Amazon as long as it does.
5,"Love the fact that it is on Subscribeand save.  The change to this food has had many benefits. My dog loves it, has aided in the suppression of tear staining (he's part beagle, part King Charles), and makes his poo firm."
5,I'm very pleased with this dog food.  Haven't ordered anything else for my dogs since I bought this.  My lab and my malti poo both eat it happily and I'm happy that it is healthy for them.
5,"I highly recommend Newman's Own Organics Dog Food. Natural, high is nutrition and with out fillers. Keep your dogs healthy and with lots of energy for a long time!"
5,It took for a week to waiting them to ship for the item but soooo pleased to myself and my dog :-) Thank you for the Newman's daughter to keeping an awesome company n' caring our pets!!!! 5 stars!
5,"We have two Westies who, to say the least, have very sensitive digestion systems.  Since using this product, their hair is soft and moisturized, they love their food, and to boot, they are down to their recommended weight. We're on the automatic delivery program and that's the best no brainer ever."
4,"The ingredients are really wholesome. And, fast delivery!<br />It would be nice if they had some type of fish formula though.<br />But my dog loves them and will buy again!"
5,We've originally bought this as our dog's first food and then switched to Wellness. Dog had runs for a few weeks hoping it would go away then went back to Newman's own and now our dog feels a lot better. Never switched his food ever again.
5,This brand is the lowest price I can find in organic dog kibbles. The subscription is convenient. I wish the company makes 50 pound bags.
5,"We have been using this product for over a year now, Goldie our dog loves it, she is 15 years old now."
2,"Good but not my favorite.........Newman's Own Organics Adult Dog Food Formula, 7-Pound Bag....I now buy my dogs Taste of the Wild Salmon just great stuff buy it on Amazon!~ The less fillers the better not meals for my doggies!~"
5,"4-year old Elkhound loves this food, and it keeps her in great health.  Amazon has the best price I've found for this food, and it's even better with subscribe and save.  I highly recommend it."
4,"Great alternative to dog food with corn and other by-products. Our picky dogs enjoy this food and so do I, knowing<br />it is better their health."
5,I feel good about the quality and mix it with canned PN food.  She doesn't care for it by itself but then she doesn't like any dry dogfood.
5,"One of the best for our 11 year old Jack Russell mix.<br />I always check to make the first ingredient is meat or chicken, not a byproduct."
5,I have 4 adult Shih-Tzus and while they do prefer it when I cook for them...... they do eat this and it has helped eliminate the brownish tear stains they get when I feed them some dry foods.
5,"My YorkiePoo thrives on this dog food.  I ran out two weeks ago, no local source, bought a competitor's so called equivalent only to see my Quinn suffer from itching and belly aches.  I ordered this from Amazon yesterday, free shipping, they sent it out hours later and I recieved it today!"
4,"I don't know why, because it doesn't look very appetizing, but my two dachshunds love this stuff and scarf it down with great abandon."
4,I have been using the product for several months now.  The dogs seem to like it and having it delivered is really nice.  What more can I say?
5,"Hello, I have tried some different foods for my dog,but this is the one she tolerates the best.I have a 13 year old Border Collie/Lab mix and have been giving her this food for quite some time now.She loves it.Thank you."
4,"My dog never met a meal she didn't love including this one.  The price is very good, especially utilizing the subscription option.  I make 2/3 of the food I feed my dog, it's very easy and economical and the best way to control the quality."
5,very high quality food that my dog will actually eat .. always ships promptly and well packaged
1,"This food might have great contents, but my 7 1/2 lb, 11/2 yr old poodle doesn't like the taste. She's not a picky eater."
5,This large bag of dry pet food is highly recommended for you adult dog. It's also worth purchasing this larger sized bag (or get two of them at once) in order to stock up on this food for a greater length of time.
5,"My dogs love it, even the little princess terrier.  I've tried many other brands and they enjoy this one the most as so far."
5,Fast Delivery.  Product arrived exactly as described.  Would purchase again from this company.
5,"I rotate between Newmans, Nature Balance, and Ceasar Milans organic dog food. My dog eat's all three so can't say which is better. My main reason to purchase this brand (or any Newman product) is for the charity the profits goes to. My way of supporting companies that give back."
3,I don't know why this got such good reviews but my Yorkshire really doesn't like it. He likes Iams more than this and it's cheaper.
3,"I guess my animals (cat and dog) can't read the amous names on bag warpings, as they almost refuse to eat this stuff unless nothing else available and they are hungry."
1,The number one ingredient is chicken... not organic chicken just the hormone pumped junk you wouldn't eat yourself. I will stick to Natural Balance which is sold here on Amazon as well.
1,"I will never again even CONSIDER a dog food with corn, wheat or soy in it. Grain has no place in a dog's diet!"
2,"Both of my dogs had trouble with this formula, allergy wise.  It took me a couple of days to realize that their itching was related to the food.  Needless to say I won't buy this product again."
5,"I have not tried this product personally, but my dog has, and he loves it, and is aging well. He's getting a bit grey, but is as bouncy as he ever was 10 years ago."
5,My cocker puppy 4 mos threw up castor and poullex and Natural balance and had loose motions. SO i tried this and he did great ! even the red streaking from his eyes have almost cleared up after a month along with similasan eye drops. which is great.
5,Dogs love the taste and I love the company. Especially convenient to have it delivered rather than me lugging it home.
5,We switched up from nutro chicken and rice to newmans own and chip's bowel movements are so much more dense and compact. our vet says its a sign of good food. nuff said.
4,My 3 dogs love this food and are thriving on it.  Ingredients are high quality and Amazon price is better than anywhere I can get it except on sale.
5,"Human-grade chicken, all organic dog food.  The food is delivered to me monthly on schedule via the Subscribe & Save program.  The profits benefit pet charities.<br />What's not to like?"
5,"Our dog LOVES this food!  He was having serious gastrointestinal problems that weren't clearing up -- until we started him on Newman's Own.  Since then, he has been regular, happy, and healthy."
5,"I, like most people, switched to organic after the dog food scare and after trying a lot of different foods, settled on this one.  My dogs like it and I feel good about it feeding it to them."
5,My dog's love it. Made from excellent ingredients and a great price at Amazon.com. My Chihuahua has allergies and I've noticed she isn't scratching or chewing on her paws anymore.
5,My dog loves it and she doesn't scratch at her ears anymore (she used to scratch her ears all the time because she kept an ear infection!)
5,"This is going to be short and sweet.  My little (10&13 lbs) dogs love it, easy to eat small bits, and it's a high grade food souce for them.  What more can I say."
5,"I have been feeding this to my 13 yr old Beagle for years.  Newman's Own is of excellent quality and it's certified organic. Also, a large portion of sales are donated to charity."
5,The best dog food ever for my dog. He has a sensitive stomach and not only does he love it but it totaly agrees with him.  My vet also feels it's a great product. Even my dogs teeth are cleaner since being on it.
5,My dog loved this food and he was a very picky eater.  I felt I was giving him healthy food with no fillers.  I also loved the convinence of having it sent to the house monthly.  Not having to shop and drag a big weightly item home was great.
5,"My dogs give this a high-five.  I've never tried it, but the list of ingredients is sound and it make their tails wag."
5,One of my dogs is allergic to almost everything in dog food.  Newman's Own for senior dogs makes all the difference in her health.
5,"My Dog is really ""Picky"" when it comes to his food and I usually have to mix his old with his new for a few days ""Until he will eat"" his new food. I opened the bag when my Order arrived and gave my dog a taste...... He loved his new food & this is his second 15 pound bag!"
5,I adopted a dog from rescue shelter who has an allergy to corn. I live in a small town and found no dog food that didn't contain mainly corn. This was perfect and my new pet is doing very well on it and loves it. It's an added bonus that it comes straight to my door.
5,My 72 lb dog has never refused to eat Newman's Own Organic.  I'm glad that there is a pet food made without 'junk' that I can feed my pet.
1,The chicken is not organic. It is the MAIN ingredient. This is NOT organic dog food. It is marketing lies to fool you into thinking you are paying more for quality ingredients when you are not getting organic chicken.
5,My three little dogs love this food and I love it too sense it is organic and has no animal by products.
5,"This dogfood has never been recalled, has protein as the first two ingredients, and is organic. Doesnt make my dog throw up like when she tries other dogfoods full of fat and fakeness. Cant get better!"
5,Excellent I needed a dog food without copper as an ingredient and found Newmansbon the Internet. It has proven to be a great choice and my dog had thrived
4,"I feel better about feeding this product to my dogs.  I was using another popular brand,<br />but it contained a lot of fillers.  One of my dogs is ""pickier,"" so he would prefer a meatier<br />taste, but he does clean it up eventually."
4,"Good product. Dogs are vary satified with it.  Would like to have in a larger bag(20 lbs.), if this could/would be an option."
5,Newman's Own Food is one of the best on the market.  It is a natural healthy food for my senior dog.
5,This gum is amazing. The flavor burst in your mouth and it also has a wonderful refreshing sensation.<br />We love it. (My husband and I.
2,"I bought a big pack of this gum.  The flavor (Kiwi Watermelon) is ok, but it didn't last long, I found I would usually pop a new piece in my mouth after about 2-3 minutes to get another shot of flavor.  I Wouldn't really recommend this gum, it's not horrible, but not that great either."
1,"this gum is the worst i have ever purchased, plain and simple. within two seconds of chewing taste gone!"
5,I'm really picky about the gum I chew.  This is great and the flavor lasts a long time.  I recommend it.
5,"This is great cheese, a little sharp yet creamy, with slight bits of crunchy. Great with a micro brew. The Merlot and Raspberry are yummy too."
5,"My baby loves this apple sauce. He didn't like the gerber brand at all, but yummys this down right away and I like that it is organic."
1,Are you kidding me! $32.00!!! I buy this all day long at popular wholesale clubs for under $10.00. No more then $15.00 at reqular stores. Watch these prices guys.
1,"I absolutely love this stuff, but I pay $2.00 to $2.50 for a 6-pack in the grocery store.  Why is this price so HIGH?"
1,You can get these SOOOOOOOOOOOOO much cheaper at wholesale clubs.<br /><br />I get the 24/20oz(yes 20oz!) for $11 or $12!! Its actually even cheaper then buying the bottles from the regular store!
5,"Awesome coffee!!! I have ordered this pack of bags twice now and getting ready to order a third. If you like dunkin donuts hazelnut, but don't like the price this is a great and inexpensive alternative."
4,"I'm no coffee snob but this is still much better than crap you get a Starbucks (I drink black coffee so flavor really matters when its not covered by caramel and other junk). Great coffee for a great price, especially if you get it when Amazon is offering the $3 off coupon."
5,"I don't drink Hazelnut coffee, but my wife says this is the best she has ever had and asked me to buy more for her."
5,We enjoy Community Coffee when we go to New Orleans. I was glad to see it available in your online store
5,I gave this a try when it was on special and I totally Love this product Iam as fussy coffee drinker this product is just a lovely as those higher priced coffee's that tend to break my bank account ..GIVE it a TRY
5,"My husband and I both like coffee with rich flavor and good taste, but we do not like the bitter or burnt taste some coffees have.  This Community Hazelnut has excellent flavor.  We make it fairly strong and are very pleased with this coffee."
4,not the best coffee but it is not bad as well. we bought more after we tried the first time because for the price we've got it is fine. Godiva is still our favorite but this one is okay too.
1,"I HATED this coffee.  I'm much more of a Starbucks or Peet's loyalist, so maybe I'm a bit spoiled.  But after reading many positive reviews of this company I decided to give it a try.  Big mistake.  I had a hard time giving it away.  It definitely tastes like chicory.  Blagk.  Bad news."
5,i have been looking for this candy for over a year..... I used to enjoy this as a young kid and now its back!! all there is to say is YUMMY!
2,"Very weak blend, slightly bitter aftertaste.  Noticeably light brew when brewing.  Won't purchase again, in fact, I regret this purchase.  Even on 4 oz brew, still really weak taste."
5,"I have tried many different brands and flavors of K-Cup coffees and I have to say, this one is one of the best I have ever had. I would strongly recommend it. It is very hard to find so buy it if you can get it at a good price."
5,"This coffee is bold, dark and tasty. unlike many other types that are too watery and weak this one brews nice and strong cup of coffee."
4,"I thought this coffee was really good, but I think the next time I order, I will order something a bit stronger."
5,I am from Colombia and I was looking for a coffee that tasted like back home. Everyday when I make coffee and the aroma is in the whole kitchen .. It feels like home and it tastes just like it. I love this coffee.
5,"We love this medium full-flavored roast. Very smooth taste..no bitter or acidic taste, at all.Excellent coffee..good value  :)  Also, try Timothy's Kona..very good,also."
5,I'm very happy with this-- drains my ears and sinuses quite effectively.  Works better for me than guaifenisen.
5,"I LOVE THIS TEA , SERIOUSLY ! MY MOM AND I SUFFER VERY BAD WITH SINUS PROBLEMS AND WE HEARD ABOUT THIS TEA CALLED SINUS BUSTERS . WE JUST HAD TO SEE WHAT ALL THE TALK WAS ABOUT , YOU KNOW . IT IS A VERY GOOD TEA THAT TAKES YOUR BLUES AWAY AND MAKE YOU SLEEP GREAT . ALOHA !"
5,"I have been suffering from post nasal drip and congestion for so many years, and this tea made such a big difference after a couple of days. I drink it 1-2 times per day and I feel so much better. I can breathe easier, and have little or no post nasal drip throughout the day."
5,"Not sure exactly what is in it, but it really helps my sinus condition.  A family member who spent time in China said it tasted like other healing herbs she had had while there.  The taste is earthy, and takes some getting used to, but it is worth it."
1,"This tea didn't do anything, steal have issues with itching throat, ear and everything else. But I do enjoy the smell of it.. ill say it last up to a few hours and that's it."
2,"I had high hopes when I purchased this produce, shipping was amazingly fast and I've tried it a few times. I don't enjoy the taste, and since I don't sweeten my tea, it wasn't that great, and it did nothing for my sinuses. Will not purchase again but I do recommend the seller."
5,I used to take sudafed for my stuffy nose. I tried this tea and felt relief immediately. I usually drink this tea twice a week and have not yet felt the stuffy nose. Would highly recommend.
5,I bought this tea based upon some research I had done into the ingredients and by reading the reviews posted here.  This tea has a wonderful flavor and smell.  I have enjoyed it very much and it helps me at bedtime with my sinus issues.  Great Stuff!
5,"But a naturapath told me to take this, vitamin D, vitamin C, and something he mixed and I got better from a 8-month sinus issue."
5,We love sinus buster tea.  My husband thinks it's great and clears out his sinus' regularly.
5,"Good, light taste.  Not too strong of a flavoring, and very little, if any, aftertaste.  They go down easy,...MMMmm.  Definitely happy with the purchase."
4,"I enjoyed this product.  They are a good value for the amount you get.  I did not sense much honey in the product, so a bit more flavor would be nice.  I would buy again."
5,"I though it was fresh, moist;  However, personally alittle to sweet for me.  I think i`ll stick with the John Wayne brand.  JW brand is more expensive but it seems to soot my taste buds better."
5,really great snack for hiking or a baseball game....My son and I enjoy taking them when we go on a road trip to hold us over till we find a good restaurant!
4,"Taste great, once in awhile you will come across a pocket of fat but its worth the risk. Anything from this supplier is good quality and value."
5,"These have a good snap when you bite into them and a nice honey beef taste!<br />Choo Choo R Snacks always has excellent customer service, and they throw in a few samples as well!"
5,"I really enjoyed these beef sticks. Even though I preferred them to be a little bit harder, they were tasty. I just put them in the frig and that worked out fine. Nice flavor, not too sweet or spicy. They sure didn't last in my house!"
5,"Could only find at local Shell gas station......now I have a source to buy all I want!  Fast & secure delivery....price is great!  Will order again, and again, etc.,....."
4,These beef sticks have a great flavor and the price seems fair. There is no label stating as to where this product needs to be refrigerated.
5,"This is definitely sweet, but that's how I like my wine.  No backsweetening needed!  It has a pear flavor and chilled ... well, it's my favorite."
4,"Good kit, however using the F-pack (pear juice) made it WAY too sweet, I ordered two more and intent to blend the kits, the second two with out the added pear juice."
5,I would call this a summer wine-light with strong pear notes. Almost clear in color. Nice finish and a good wine for those who don't really like wine.
4,"I bought this kit after I really enjoyed making the tropical riesling from the same manufacturer.  It was equally easy to make, but it is very peary.  I wouldn't have minded it if it was more subtle.  Still very drinkable, but I suspect that I'll be mixing it more."
5,"This is my third wine kit and it's going so fast I should order another.  We took samples from all three kits to a Thanksgiving get-together.  More than once, I heard, ""Who's going to finish off this bottle so we can open another pear?"""
5,"The 6 hour power energy shot does just what it says.  A lot of times I only drink half the bottle to achieve the mental alertness that I look for.  It's one of the best energy shots out there when you figure in price, taste and effectiveness."
5,"Pros: Free super saving shipping, small, juicy taste, diffrent flavors, and healthy..<br /><br />Cons: Sometimes seller only haves 12 vs 36. to order.. I like to have several packs.."
5,"I picked up my first bottle at our local farmers' market.  We loved it so much.  So flavorful.  But sadly, there is no farmers' market in the winter.  So glad to see it on amazon."
5,"This olive oil is great.  Tastes very good and is outstanding for use with bread, pasta, and for cooking in general.  Love the flavor."
2,"I received these in bad condition. Most of them were broken, but the ones that weren't had holes in them. They were so weak that they would tear when you tried to roll them. I would try three ladies brand. They are a way higher quality."
1,I bought this brand and it was just horrible. Amazon needs to source and offer 3 Ladies brand wrappers as they are just superior to anything out on the market today.
5,We are regular customers for the delicious coffee and purchase the decafe French Roast also. It makes a single fresh cup at a time in our Flavia Coffee maker
5,In my area one cannot find Cinnamon Mentos.  I am so happy I was able to find this flavor.  I just love this product.
5,This product is my wife's favorite.  Kids love it too.  Would suggest it if you like cinnamon.  I would buy this again
5,"Dynasty brand green tea is the best green tea I've ever tasted.  It never tastes stale, unlike brands I've bought in grocery stores.  This is because each tea bag is packed in a sealed envelope with a metallic lining.  The metal apparently keeps out moisture."
5,They are awesome to snack on.  They have a little kick to them but that's the best part.  They help me with my cravings for sweets.
5,Reed's Crystallized Ginger is the real deal! It's natural and basically just ginger with sugar. 1 piece takes care of my candy cravings and aids my digestion of lunch etc.
5,"Try these first for all your seafood soups and stews.  They're just amazing. The flavor enhances all your seafood and just makes it wonderful.  Plus, these are great just to snack on out of the bag.  Kids love them!  We use them for chilis, soups, and recipes as well.  Highly recommend!"
5,"If you are on the paleo/caveman/primal/hunter-gatherer diet, YOU WILL ADORE THESE COOKIES!<br />otherwise stay away, your taste buds aren't attuned to the uniquely sweet NATURAL cookies. End of story Paleo PURCHASE, SAD (standard American diet) skip it"
5,"I thought I'd try the multi-pack to see which flavor I liked the best, but I like them all. They are healthy, fulfilling, and all good ingredients I can actually pronounce. These are the smaller packs, and now I can proceed to ordering the larger bags. Love these cookies!"
1,Formula itself is great. Works wonders for a baby that spits up but WTF... why is it so expensive here? $121 for 6 12.9oz cans. That's $20 for a 12.9oz can when you can buy a 24oz can at any store for less than $25. Almost double the price...I don't get it.
2,"I love using generous amounts of vinegar on sandwiches, salads, etc., but this drink was so vinegary that I got a bit of a tummy ache.  It tasted closer to salad dressing than it did a drink.  I tried really hard to like it, but no go."
5,This is the best ever.  Just add HOT water and mix.  Yummy with anything can even add to cream sauces and soups.  Add some sausage and you are in Heaven.  Yummy Yum.  Cannot go wrong ordering this product.
5,"These are really excellent breakfast bars. Note to the previous reviewer: the Nutrigrain bars, last I checked, had artificial color in them. These don't. They also taste very good. This is our third order through Amazon (great price) and my daughter misses them when we're out."
5,I keep a box of these in my desk at work.  They make a wonderful snack or are great if I didn't have time for breakfast.
5,Whole family likes these.  Tasty but not over sweet.  Much more healthy for you than most bars.  Excellentprice through Amazon on the repeating order subscription.
3,"barbara's yogurt bars are okay.  i found the whole grain bar very dry and there really isn't much blueberry, or for that matter, apple flavors.  on the positive side, the bar is a soft chew.  total carbs 29g.  it's an okay bar in the glut of cereal bars to choose from at the grocery store."
5,"My son has been eating these for the last two years and loves them.  I love them because they have yogurt in them, and for a picky eater provides some good nutrition.  Wish they were organic, but we can't have them all.  Much healthier than Nutragrain."
2,"These aren't as good as other bars of this type. My kids won't eat them, nor will my husband. They are all fond of the Nutrigrain variety, but I thought these would be a healthier alternative."
4,Good product! good price  fast shipping . needs an insert in lid to seal container better!
5,I couldn't find this product in the store.  I love the size and the price was just right.  Love the promptness of the delivery.
5,"Our Corgi loves all sizes, shapes, and flavors of Dingo Bone treats!  The other reviewer commented on the VENDOR; we've never got a bad Dingo yet!  Highly recommended!"
1,When I received this product it was old and dried out!  Dingo makes a good product.  I buy them all the time and my dog loves them but this supplier should pay more attention to what they ship.
1,most of the nuts in these bags were so old they had turned black totally worthless will never order again
1,"I did not even receive the correct product, what I received were raw UNSHELLEd peanuts, but had no option to return them becuase amazon does not allow this. I attempted to contact but got no reply, do not buy from here!"
5,"I recommand this product. My childrens (5 and 3) love it, pouches as very usefull especially for breaks.<br />To choose. Enjoy"
5,I've tried many different brands of Virginia peanuts but these are far and away the best. I've turned my entire family on to this brand and they've ordered them also. They're superb.
5,Not only is the sweetener great in coffee or ice tea it makes a slammin skinny margarita.  Also try their Agava Simple Syrup - LOVE IT
4,Alot of moms like me like this item because our babies have no constapation on it i love it very much.
5,"no gas for baby, no extra bubbles when you shake it in warm or cold water, mixes perfectly without much time... this is easy.  my kid was happy swapping from breast milk to this with no hesitation when my milk dried up at 6mths."
5,Our Baby loves it. And Amazon is very reliable and fast free super saver shipping is always a good deal. Thanks amazon.
5,"I read other reviews before buying and they are not encoraging.. But still for some reasons, I got  to buy (to use my amazon gift card).  But then I am very happy with the purchase. Delivery is prompt. Quantity is correct . Over all a few bucks savings than you buy at a retail shop."
5,Have tried a few different peanut brittle's from Amazon and this is by far the best. It is LOADED with peanuts plus being in a sealed tin makes it seem fresher wit minimal breakage.
1,These were rancid upon receipt.  Terrible.  Very little sugar if any used.  Something went wrong with these as I can't believe anyone would see this as a final product.  Both cans!
5,"My husband has to limit the amount of sugar he takes in and these contain no sugar, and they taste great!"
5,"My children will only eat healthy products, and they love these graham crackers.  I am so glad that they are available through Amazon!"
3,"These crackers are terrific, and they are priced right.  However, i ordered them on 10/29/06, and the expiration date on the box was 12/31/06.  We have only eaten four boxes.  They still taste fine after the expiration date, but... am i really expected to consume 12 boxes in 2 months?"
5,"These are very good, they were a great price and fast-free shipping when you purchase enough food.  The only thing is that the box was smaller than I guessed it would be."
5,"I was quite surprised to find that Sociables were available thru Amazon. I cannot find them in the local supermarkets and thought I would have to give them up.<br />They arrived quickly, in great condition, and we now are on regular shipments of them."
5,"Wow I heard of this candy but could never find it, now I am hooked. Now I don't have to suck on child lemons with salt, just shakey shakey."
3,If you love vegetable soup you should like this. Yes it has come chicken and large noodle type items in it too.<br />But it was not as good as I expected or hoped it would be
3,I enjoyed this soup.  It was flavorful with a nice blend of spices.  I will buy it again.
5,"If you like coconut water, then you will love Taste Nirvana!!! It has bits of coconut in it. Not just a few, it has a lot of little bits."
5,this is great coconut water and there is no added sugar. its all natural and they use ripe coconut not young coconut.
4,"I had coconut trees growing in my backyard in Southeast Asia, and enjoyed drinking coconut water right from the coconut itself. Taste Nirvana Real Coconut Water with Pulp is the closest to the real thing that I've found."
5,IMHO. There is simply not a better beverage on Earth. Since I need to add  some more words see prior sentence.
5,This will ruin supermarket mustard for you. High quality and just the right amount of bite so it allows the food to shine through.
5,"A very tasty little cake. The cake was surprisingly moist, and the caramel rum sauce was very sweet but not too overpowering. We'll definitely be buying this product again."
5,"The cake was a little smaller than I thought, but it was delicious.  My husband and I enjoyed it so much, we are ordering more for Christmas!"
5,"This tea actually tastes the way a rose smells.  It's like sipping on roses when you drink it.  I'm glad it can be purchased on Amazon because I looked in every regular food store as well as the more unusual stores, like Trader Joes, that carry unusual food items and could not find it."
1,"It says Habenero peppers on the ingredients, but my guess is they just waved it over the closed bottle. Smells like molasses and soy sauce. Taste like molasses and soy sauce. Absolutely boring."
5,Great sauce! Used in many Jamaican restaurants to help with the heat of the jerk seasoning. Most use Walkerwood jerk seasoning to make the jerk and pour this on later on the jerk or the rice.
1,"Tastes too sweet, which Jerk Seasoning is not.  Walker's woods is the most authentic to taste.  This was a waste."
2,"I thought I would try this, but I am sticking with my UNCLE JOES JERK SAUCE!!! This is sweet & not hot....should be hot if they are going to put jerk on the label"
5,"I LOVE this sauce! It is sweet and molasses-y, with a tiny kick of heat.  I use it to make Hawaiian chicken or pork all the time.  I've never had authentic Jamaican jerk, so I can't vouch for accuracy there, but my whole family loves this one :D"
5,"These cloves are very finely ground and extremely pungent. I use them in cooking, I let a small amount soak in coconut oil and use it for massage oil, and also mix it straight into beeswax for candles. It works well on all counts. I am very satisfied and will be reordering when needed."
5,this is the best halal beef jerky i have ever tasted. also the company truly gives an Orthodox Muslim a good choice in buying because when you call them to ask about their slaughtering process they quickly give you the answer unlike other Muslim company's who try do deceive the consumer.
5,"Well, after trying a lot of brands, this is probably the best beef jerky I ever tasted!"
5,Great product and it tastes great.  I keep a bag in my drawer at work in case I get hungry and its great to eat to keep my protein count high since I'm working out.
5,Never had jerky before because I've never seen a Halal version. Was a little apprehensive at first but found it highly addictive. Went through a whole bag in one sitting. I recommend all my curious Muslim brothers and sisters to try it.
5,"amazing taste, incredible quality. This is the best beef jerky I have ever had. I think it's even better than the other non-halal ones. This beef jerky made me leave my first review ever on amazon though I'm a regular costumer of theirs. Thumbs up!"
5,"Product arrived on time, nicely packaged and gift wrapped, the treats were all quality and very good.  Nice keepsake box."
5,"I got these for my mom who is always sucking on a cough drop. These are gummi and are minty like a cough drop, she really likes them. A unique gummi creation."
5,"This oil is wonderful. I've had almond oil that was so strong it overwhelmed what I was using it for (salad, cooking).  I loved the flavor of this oil and will be buying more."
5,"Good product and reasonable price compared with local store. For people who use it everyday, it's a great deal... I would recommend it to everyone who loves thyme flavor."
5,I use a lot of various spices in my cooking and wanted to find a source with a quality product at a reasonable price.  Frontier met that discription.
5,This is the best olive oil not for cooking as any olive oil will work the flavor and aroma is fantastic Brings you to Italy Use on salads breads for dipping.
5,"this item came exactly as described and shipped on time which is very important for Christmas!!  Thanks for a reliable, easy shopping experience."
5,"I love jerk cooking, and this is the perfect jerk sauce to put over a freshly cooked piece of jerk chicken, pork, goat or beef. Each bottle does not last long at our house."
5,"I love Pamelas Baking Mix.  The 25 lb bag is quite large and the expiration is March 2, 2010, only 4 months after my purchase. I will never be able to use that much baking mix in such a short amount of time.  Not worth it."
5,"I have a cafe in Talent , Oregon.  I couldnt find this product wholesale anywhere. This is so convienient and free shipping and it was here in just a few days!!  My supplier could only get small amounts of inferior product and it would take 3 weeks. Thanks Amazon!"
5,You can exchange this baking mix for regular flour in almost any recipe.  Also makes yummy pancakes and waffles!
5,We go through Pamela's like crazy.  Fantastic for pancakes (we like to add a little vanilla to batter).  It also makes great chocolate chip cookies and banana bread.  The 25 lb bag is definately the best way to go value wise.
5,This is exactly what I wanted. It is much cheaper to buy it this way and not through a store. Thank you so much!! I'm new to the gluten free diet and this is perfect!!
5,The product arrived undamaged just as it was described on the website. No delays and arrived quickly. The customer was satisfied with the quality and arrival of order.
5,"When you have health issues taking Gluten out of your diet is a good way to start, it may be the source of your problem, it has been in my case, and using Pamela's Products has helped me get on the right track to feeling better."
5,I've tried tons of GF pancake mixes.  I could choke on most of them or just decide not to ever eat pancakes again.  These are so moist and delicious.  My 92 year old grandmother was just diagnosed with celiac disease.  She loves them too.  My wife and children who are not GF also love them.<br />m
5,"Erin Baker's products are a favorite for my family.  The breakfast cookie mini's are great for snacks & coffee breaks and especially good for traveling.<br />This is a denser product than a regular cookie, nice and chewy and filling with only 100 calories."
5,"I was expecting hard tasteless healthy cookies.  It is soft, a little chewy and yummy.  Very tasty."
4,If you are looking for a rich chocolate cookie look somewhere else.  But if you are looking for a fairly good tasting 100 calorie breakfast or snack these are pretty good.
5,"I've been having these cookies for about 4 years, and l love it, but  I can not find them, in the store where I used to buy, I live in San Diego, so I would like to buy them here, thaks."
5,I think this is the best Dulce de Leche I ever tried.  I discovered at the Llao Llao hotel in Bariloche (Argentina) on a recent trip.  They serve it at breakfast there.
5,"I was born in Argentina and this is a top of the line dulce de leche, to eat with toasts or as add-on to cakes (comparable to Chimbote).<br /><br />Note: I noticed that dulce de leche is an acquired taste. So unless you grew up eating it, you may consider dulce de leche to be a little too sweet."
5,"My father grew up in Argentina and since he came to the States has been searching for the perfect dulce de leche that reminded him of his childhood. He doesn't have to search anymore, I bought him a couple of jars this past Christmas and he has been a happy camper ever since."
5,"We used to have a pipeline to get homemade dulce de leche from a bonafide Argentine, but alas, said pipeline moved away.  This is the next best thing and doesn't involve me hanging out in the kitchen for hours while my milk caramelizes."
5,"I am so glad I ordered this; it is the best dulce de leche I have been able to find. I had read about this somewhere and am now convinced that many people are not familiar with this product. If you like anything caramel, you'll love this!"
5,"This is a good quality product, which definitely helps tame my tummy.  I have it each evening and it makes a huge difference in how I feel.  Definitely recommended, along with Heather's Acacia Fiber, which is life-changing."
5,I think this is a really good deal. I seal it up in a rubbermaid container and just scoop it out to brew. Good stuff!
5,"The fennel smells fresh, tastes good, and makes a great addition to one of my tea blends. It is packaged exactly as shown in the picture. Came in a timely manner. Thanks!"
5,"These are guaranteed to be a hit with my kids -<br />Like regular gummy bears, but even better - with extra flavor.<br />Perfect consistency....Not too chewy... great all the way around."
5,"My four kids LOVE these, it's great that there's zero nasty stuff in it like grocery store 'fruit' (ie total chemical junk) snacks. A 'safe' kid snack!"
5,These are always delicious & a much healthier alternative to most candies/ kid's sugary snacks. The size is perfect for goodie bags & even fits in large Easter eggs.
5,"You cant go wrong with Rosa Monte Especial! this is one of the best yerbas in Argentina. Go for it. Seller did everything ok, in time and etc.!"
5,"Rosamonte Especial can never let you down. Tastes fresh and strong. I smell Argentina in every sip. Yerba mate is going through an increase in prices, almost double..crazy. But it's worth the value. I will never change Rosamonte ESPECIAL!"
5,Great price and my cat loves this food.  He has been on it for 9 years.  My vet says he is the healthest cat he sees.
3,"Wonderful ingredients list but the peas are whole. If I don't mush them several of my cats just eat around them.<br />The cats & I all prefer the regular Felidae formula and it's a little cheaper, too."
5,"I can only say that this is great coffee, never tried before until recently.. Now I like it better than Folgers!"
5,We had not been able to find the Dark Roast Yuban in any of the stores recently. When I ordered this they gave me a date of receipt. It actually came two days earlier. My husband was so excited when he saw what I had ordered. Thanks for the quick service on a great product.
2,"Warning: it contains food preservatives. Other than that it is fine, but presence of preservatives in dates (!) justifies my low 2 star rating."
5,I found these tubs at Costco and was dismayed to discover that they are no longer carrying them. I buy the 4-pack here at amazon and I am very satisfied. The snacks are tasty; not too salty and offers a variety of chips in the mix that all blend nicely.
5,This is definitely the best snack mix I have ever had!  It got me and my buddies through many movie nights while deployed in Iraq.
5,"I agree with all who have said that this is a great snack, but I just wanted to say that I piad $36.95 for a 4 pack of 30 oz containers from the actual UTZ site."
5,Enjoyed the product and they also provided very fast shipping.  I'm about out and need to order more.
5,This mix is great anytime.  I love it.  Would recommend it to anyone that likes Chex mix.
5,I absolutely love this mix.  We keep it on our home bar and everyone loves it.
5,"This is an addicting, fantastic snack mix. It has a wonderful variety of crackers and blend of flavors."
1,"The taste is great but it gave me a terrible migraine from the MSG.  Those who are sensitive beware.  Also, MSG addition is usually a way to fake true flavor."
5,"This is good stuff.  However, I planted it, and no cats grew up.  Just grass."
5,"YUM, I am SO HAPPY my mom bought this delicious and nutritious cat grass for me!  It helps me digest my food, and is just fun to poke around in when I'm bored.  And I notice that mom eats it too (when she thinks I'm not looking!) because it is so tasty!"
5,Received this product much sooner than promised. Seeds grow as claimed and plant is great. My cat loves it. Highly recommend product and seller.
5,"So, these seeds do exactly as advertised.  I bought 10 paks of seeds, and have so far used 4.  I always get a pot full of strong, bright green grass, which my cat readily devours.  Not much else can be said.  Good deal, good grass. Man."
5,Our cats love the grass.  It's easy to grow and it sprouts within a few days so you have an ample supply on hand continually.  An excellent product to maintain a cat's health.
5,I wanted to grow some cat grass for my kitty to distract him from my other plants in the house. I planted them in a large window sill box with potting soil. I had a large bunch of grass in about a week. My cat loves it and it looks great in my kitchen.
5,"These seeds grow very easy, one seed pack grew about 7 little pots. I would grow using a few seeds about every 4-5 days in 2 separate little pots for my cats so they never was without. A great buy."
5,"Excellent germination!  Only 4 days and about 90% of the seeds are up to an inch.  If I hadn't done this before, the instructions would have been wonderful, they left nothing out. I WILL buy these again."
5,This was the only seed pack I bought of three different brands that came up and the cats are still enjoying.
5,Tiger loves the cat grass..It only takes about a week after the grass is planted to come up..So it grows very fast..I planted it in a pot outside it did very good outside..
5,It was so easy to grow and my cat loved it. I highly recommend this purchase. Your cat will love you forever!
5,"These seeds always grow, unlike some other brands. Every single one of my cats totally loves the resulting oat grass. There is nothing else that all five of them all agree on so unanimously.<br /><br />Thanks for such a great batch of seeds!"
5,Excellent product and price. Would do business with this company again.<br />My cat loves it. Can't wait to plant it again.
5,"the true test is that our cats really loves the grass we grow from these seeds! and they grew very easily in pots, too."
5,I bought 4 packets and planted one of them.  It only took a couple of days for the sprouts.  My cats love it!
5,"My two cats must not be interested in grass, because it grew but they ignored it. Had no problems growing it."
3,"It was hard to grow but once it grew my cat loved it. I haven't found any seeds that work well yet, but I am still looking. I would buy this again is=f I had better luck with growing it."
5,This product is great for growing cat grass.  Gives a hearty grass is easy & fast growing.  Will purchase in the future.
5,"It got here fast, grew quickly and my cats love it. Excellent choice anyone can make their cats very happy by purchasing this product, plus my cats have completely stopped chewing on all other plants in the house."
5,Our cat loves to eat this grass and it was so easy to grow too. I have never been much into growing plants but this was easy and actually useful rather than just grow plants around the house. Recommended product.
5,I have 3 cats...2 could care less..the other one LOVES this so much.  I have it by their food bowls and she nibbles on it every day.  No throwing up like outside grass.
3,"My cat love this grass. Really easy to grow, only 3 days. Im not going to count the seeds but i dont think they are 500 seeds."
5,i have 3 cats here at home and they need to dosome grazing so i baught  this to see if they like it :) even though its just out grass lol
5,"I just picked these up at random at my local Asian market, and I am really impressed. I'd drive the 15-20 minutes there again just to pick these up. They have an excellent coffee flavor and aren't horribly sweet like most hard candies. Each candy is individually wrapped and lasts a good long time."
4,"Great candy! Sweet and intense, low calorie and delightful. Made with actual coffee, not just flavoring. Fantastic. Reasonably priced too."
4,Japanese sweet but strong black coffee candy. Lasts a long time in your mouth and costs alot less on Amazon than elsewhere. Made with real caffeinated coffee for a little energy.
5,"There is nothing wrong with this product, but it is overpriced.  With a little research you can buy this for less than half the price.  Buyer beware"
5,My cats really love this 9 Lives Seafood and Poultry cat food.<br />They prefer this pate to the slices or chunks.<br />They are a perfect weight and have beautiful shiny coats<br />and lots of energy.<br />It is good quality food and is very fresh.
4,We enjoy these peanut butter and jelly bars.  My 5 year old with celiac disease says he can have a peanut butter and jelly sandwich again.  He loves to pack these for school snack.
5,My 2 year old recently was diagnosed allergic to Gluten. These Pb & J bars have saved us. He loves them and these are his favorite flavor.
4,"I tried these bars and they were very good, although I do like the Peanut butter chocolate chip bars better. The bars are a quick and easy to carry snack when you are on the go!"
5,Out of all the granola bars that Bakery on Main makes my 2 year old loves these the most. Maybe it's because she can still get the taste of a peanut butter and jelly sandwhich but in a snack bar :) We always have to have a box of this flavor in the house.
4,"These are good bars for being gluten free.  Not my favorite bar out of everything they carry but still good to keep around for a hunger attack.  If you really want to try something great try their Coconut Cashew Trubar.  Now, that's incredible! It's like you are being naughty but you're not!"
5,"You just can't go wrong with peanut butter and jelly. These were so delicious. As with the apple cinnamon, I had a hard time keeping my gluten free fearing husband away from these! Yummy!!!"
5,One of the best peanut butter bars I've ever had. The fruit jelly is so good and brings the whole thing together in a good snack or dessert.
5,"Of all the flavors I have tried of these bars, the Peanut butter and Jelly is my favorite!  Everyone loves peanut butter and jelly and it is just as delicious as a bar!"
5,This is my favorite granola bar! Being vegan and gluten-free is difficult when it comes to finding granola bars that meet my  needs. This one is absolutely delicious! I love the ingredients and all the strawberries throughout the whole bar.  Highly recommend!!!
5,"My sweet daughter loves these.  I mean what kid doesn't love PB&J, and what mom loves not having to make it!  They are sweet, and make you feel like you are not missing out on anything being gluten free.  Highly recommend it!"
4,"Wonderful! My son loves these granola bars! He has celiac and we wanted to try something different, these were a hit!"
5,"My girls love these bars!  They are nice for lunches or quick snacks on the go!  Good flavor!  Gluten free and Dairy free is difficult, but Bakery on Main does it right!  YUMMY"
4,Peanut butter and jelly together. How can you go wrong? It is great and without the worries of gluten makes it even better.
5,"I love these.  They really taste like a soft PB&J sandwich, and you can bring them anywhere!  Kids would love them too.  I hope they're available again soon because I'm running low!"
4,It is cubes for our horses. They came in on time and the horses like them. There is not much more to say about sugar cubes.
5,All my horses love a sweet reward. Dots hold together nicely in the reward bag.
3,"Just received a case of this tea.  It tastes good and a bit on the sweet side, but not overly sweet.  I would give it a higher and better rating if it is not made in China though."
5,"If you can get over the high price, why not enjoy some of the best coffee in the world, right here in the good ol' USA?<br /><br />Warning: once you get spoiled by this coffee, you might not ever settle for less!<br /><br />Bottom line: great product, would recommend to a friend."
3,"I enjoyed my 1st cup very much.  The aroma was heady and the flavor was pleasantly mild.  But, ultimately, it is too mild for my daily morning ""kick"". I'll be going back to my Lavazza mornings when this is gone."
4,"Tried this because it is 100% Kona and much cheaper than the other national brands I have been using. What can i say i am greatly surprised. Mild, no bite too it and no discernable acidity. This is on my shopping list from now on."
2,Spent $29  for real kona coffee and didn't want the kona blend sold here. The Hawaiian roasters was disappointing. Tasted nothing like the kona we had everyday while honeymooning in Maui. Not good
5,My son was on vacation a couple of years ago and brought back Hawaii Roaster Kona Coffee. They have a different technique the way it is grown then most coffees. I thought I would check to see if it was on Amazon. This is the best tasting coffee I ever tasted.  Well worth the money.
5,This coffee has a smoother and milder taste than a dark roasted coffee.  I like to have this coffee and a dark roasted on alternate mornings.  The daily contrast in taste keeps me appreciating the delicious coffee favors of each type.
4,"This jerky is quite pricey for a 6.5 ounce bag, but it's one of the few I've found that is salty enough and doesn't contain a bunch of sweeteners.<br /><br />The smoke flavor is also pronounced.  Unfortunately, the price is the only thing that keeps this product from getting 5 stars from me."
5,"I've reviewed this before - this jerky is fabulous. Great salt, great snap, great flavor. So tasty. I want some now."
5,"These were a wonderful surprise, more delicious than anticipated and guilt-free. I liked the smaller size pouches. Easy to carry with me; nice to give as a gift. The bonus is that they are organic. I will be buying more."
5,The walnuts and chocolate are very high quality. They are rich and decadent. It seems strange but when I'm eating just a small piece it tastes like I'm eating a brownie. Highly recommended.
5,"These smell so good I'm tempted to try them myself!  I have to keep real chocolate locked up in my house because my two chocoholic dogs will raid cupboards and chew open drawers to get to it, but they are very happy with these instead.  I'm so glad I found this safe alternative for them."
5,My dogs (and some other dogs I like to spoil too) just love these.  They are their special treats.
5,I must say that Vitakraft has put life back into my dog. He is old and Vitakraft offers him more vitamins and minerals than what he was getting from his food. Now he has more energy and begs for these choco drops.
5,I found these at a local pet store and couldn't locate them again.  Great price and dogs love them.  I rec'd my shipment quickly with no problems.
5,I bought this product because my dogs were having accidents in the laundry room overnight.  I'm not sure how or why this works...but it stopped them from peeing.  The dogs love em too.
5,"Have been buying this product for over a year and 'MAX' would eat  it as fast as I could give it to him. However one or two drops at a time for a reward, is his limit ! yogurt is his favorite."
5,"My dog loves Vitakraft Dog Drops with Carob so much, he'll do any trick possible to have one!  Sadly, they're getting harder and harder to find, so I was thrilled to find them here - and the price was great!"
5,"My puppy, Megabyte, is a very picky puppy.  After spending hundreds of dollars on finding treats that she will eat.  These are one of only two."
1,We ordered the product...our dog loves them...but no one cares if its 100 degrees outside.  recieved in one big melted ball.  thought they would ship in dry ice.  If its summer or hot in your area dont order them !!
5,My Pug absolutely adores these treats and will do anything for one.  I can get anything away from her and get her to go anywhere.  They are a big help for me and a wonderful treat for her.
5,My dog loves these treats. I can get him to do anything using them. They were much cheaper using Amazon even with the shipping charges.
1,BY THE TIME I RECEIVED THIS PRODUCT ALL 3 PACKAGES WERE MELTED SO ALL HAD TO BE THROWN AWAY BECAUSE EVERYTHING IN EACH BAG HAD MELTED TOGETHER
5,"Key Lime Pie is getting rave reviews throughout my office!  I bought a pack of it to share with my co-workers, as well as the Mint Chocolate Chip and Strawberry Shortcake varieties.  All have been tasty, but Key Lime Pie has been the star.  Excellent!!"
5,"never did I think I could put a piece of gum into my mouth and actually experience pie.  You can seriously taste the crust, the filling, and even the whipped cream on time.  I don't know how they did it, but it's amazing."
5,"I am addicted to this gum. It tastes so close to the real thing and doesn't lose flavor compared with the apple pie or strawberry. This best flavor of all of this series, along with the mint chocolate chip."
5,I couldn't find the gum at the grocery store. So I ordered it from Amazon. The order came quickly and the gum was great!
5,"Thankfully I was able to order quite a supply of this gum. My sister and I enjoy this flavor the most and was sad to read it was discontinued.  I paid a responable price so, I thank you."
5,"Wow,  I like the flavors! I've tried the Apple Pie, Mint Ice Cream and the Strawberry Shortcake (not too fond of this one..) but the others are great! I love the Apple Pie and this Key Lime Pie<br /><br />it says hydrogenated starch... not oils.. difference?"
5,"I did NOT expect this gum to be more than just your typical ""lime"" flavored ""candy"" type taste. But I was floored. This gum literally tastes like key lime pie. I swear I can even taste a graham cracker crust. The flavor only lasts a short time, but it's an amazing taste! Floored!"
5,This is the absolute best gum flavor ever.  It really tastes like Key Lime Pie and the flavor lasts a long time. Yummy!
3,"Not bad, but there are better gums than this one. At the beginning is a big explosion of flavor and sugar like sensation, but after 5 minutes is gone."
5,"Not being a hard core gum chewer, I was thrilled with this gum. A great taste in a gum that last plenty long without any loss of flavor or any kind of after taste. A pleasure in my diet routine."
5,"I really like this gum. like all of Wrigley's gum products I've tried, this is absolutely great. These Dessert Delight flavors are truly delightful."
5,"In this age where even basic service no longer exists, I was pleasantly surprised when my transaction actually came off without a hitch. Shipped on time, and the product was in good condition. Well done!"
1,"On top of the delightful aspartame, this comes complete with hydrogenated oils and is a dead ringer for Country Time Lemonade mix."
5,If you like salt and vinegar chips but want to avoid carbs then pork rinds are for you especially this brand. I'll eat these instead of chips any day!
4,"Would've rated 5 stars if it had more of a vinegar taste.  Overall, not bad at all, good snack"
4,"can't find them anywhere where I live, so glad I found them here. Not too salty or vinegary just the right amount> thanks"
5,The customer service was beyond compare.  I would gladly do business with this company again.
5,"This is a wonderful product, I was happy to see I could buy it on Amazon because our local stores quit carrying it!  We use it mostly to sprinkle over chicken wings to make a cajun wing..yummy!  It can be used on almost everything. Love It!"
5,"I grew up using this seasoning on steak, and pretty much everything. Could no longer find it in stores so ordered a case off amazon. Very happy nice spice and flavor. Highly recommend."
5,I love this product and can't get it locally anymore.  It was a fair price and the item was in stock and came quickly.  I would buy from them again.
5,"This is the best cajun seasoning ever! We use it on seafood, steaks and burgers. Seasoning enhances, not overwhelms, whatever it is put on."
5,This seasoning adds just the right amount of spice to almost any dish! If you want something with a little kick you will love this seasoning! Can't beat the price for a top notch product!
5,"Oh man, I, like many of us have tried so many Cajun Seasoning, but this company does it Right!!<br /><br />Thank you Folks at the Heart-Heat of Southern Seasoning!!<br /><br />All my love,<br />Roy Watson,<br />408-464-0100"
5,Luzianne Cajun Seasoning is a great way to spice up anything you make. It adds a nice amount of heat to your food without being over-bearing. My whole family loves it!
1,"I ordered this from Amazon and they were pure liquid. Like water. I did not feel at all comfortable feeding them to my daughter. Amazon customer service, however, was awesome and gave me a full refund"
1,Bought this after reading the good reviews - not sure if it has to do only with my package but rice and lentil mix literally has a smell of mold. I actually opened two containers to make sure it wasn't just my nose playing tricks on me. I love this brand and I am very disappointed.
5,I'd continue to buy but I'm moving over to more home made finger foods and away from glass jars...shattered too many. They like all the flavors though. Great textures too.
4,"I love the thought that these baby foods are organic.  The shipping is quick, well packaged, and easy to open.  Baby likes ALL flavors so far of ANY type of Earth's Best baby food.  However, this brand is always more watery than any other brand I've tried."
5,My one year old loves this product. She eats one every day and never gives me a problem. And I trust the ingredients which reassures me that she's eating something thats good for her.
5,"I like the variety in this pack-nice to not have to pick out individual jars and my baby likes them all! The only thing I would suggest is if you have a picky eater, maybe buy one jar at a time to test them out before you buy a huge box."
4,I purchased this food on Amazon then saw it at Babies R Us for 30 cents less per jar.  I like the product but AMAZON is overcharging!
5,My baby loves these dinners. They are very flavorful and not bland like other baby food that we have tried. I love the fact that they are organic and Amazon sells them at such a great price.
5,I used this variety pack to introduce protein into my daughter's diet.  She loves all four of the varieties!
5,"Great value if you buy it as a subscribe and save item, and I love that it automatically comes to me.  These are great and they taste really good, making me think that we bought a very high quality product for our child."
5,My son loves Earth's best baby food. He enjoys his vegetables as much as he does with his fruits. He has no problem digesting his food and never spits it up.
4,My son really enjoys all these flavors- eats them all!!! Fast shipping. No shopping in stores. Great prices. Would recommend to all.
3,LOVE earths best but my 8 mth old daughter only liked one of the 4 selections. i highly recommend buying just one of each from the store and having your baby test them before buying these in bulk. walmart usually has them for .60 each
2,"I was excited to try this product after reading all of the good reviews. I wasn't really impressed when my son tried the food. The consistency was WAY too thin, and my son would hardly eat the whole jar. I would recommend making your own baby food, or use the Gerber organic."
3,3 of the flavors are pretty good but the Sweet Potato & Chicken is pretty gross. I was wondering why my daughter didn't want to eat it until I tried it myself
2,"My baby didn't seem into these dinners, so I tried them. They're not terrible, but not good either. We'll stick with the EB fruits and veggies until she's ready for table foods."
4,This is great!  Organic baby food options - delivered to my doorstep!  The dinners are a good combination and receive a raving review from the bib wearer at the dinner table.
5,we love grilling all year long but can not get this in markets the price is great and they ship fast now i can get them year round with no salt
5,"Since being diagnosed with high blood pressure, this product has been a staple in our home. I especially enjoy the grilling blends. For the price I got it for online it was a great deak, usually much more expensive in store, so buying in bulk from Amazon is the way to go."
1,"Received 6 bottles of concentrate from Paragon. Mixed EXACTLY to their specs., and was extremely disappointed in four of the six flavors.<br /><br />I am truly saddened to have to encourage you to NOT purchase the Watermelon flavor.<br /><br />This item has be returned for a refund."
4,"100% ground Arabica beans. Not my favorite, but not bad for a light/medium brew...smells WONDERFUL as it's flowing out of the Kaldi machine. Smooth and not bitter, slight floral(?) aftertaste."
5,This jelly tastes heavenly. You wont find anything this good at the grocery store. All I can say is I'll be ordering more shortly.
4,"Awesome baby food, I bought it online to save a few bucks, but some of the jars were broken when they arrived. 5 stars for the food, 1 star for packing and shipping quality."
5,My little guy ate this all up before I could even write a review!  :)
1,"Packaging was fine but the baby food were rotten. However, Amazon.com does not let me return it. This is not right!!!! I have put the pic of the food on packaging review page. Buyers should all take a look at it."
5,I love Earth's Best products. That's the only product I use for my baby! My baby loves it and I never had any problem with it. It organic which makes it all that much better!
5,I'd continue to buy but I'm moving over to more home made finger foods and away from glass jars...shattered too many. They like all the flavors though. Great textures too.
1,Several broke during transit causing mold to grow over all the other jars. Jars are cheaper at Walmart.
5,"My 8 month old loves these. He hardly swallows one bite before he's already opened his mouth for the next bite. I make my own baby food when I have time, but when I don't, this is a great alternative."
4,This was a good buy. The variety is still close enough so i didn't have to worry if baby will like the next one
4,"I love getting this case. It actually saved me money by buying it this way...and my son loved the fruit varieties. I felt good about giving him this, because it is organic. The price is also good for the product."
5,My one year old loves this product. She eats one every day and never gives me a problem. And I trust the ingredients which reassures me that she's eating something thats good for her.
5,I have a habit of trying everything myself before offering it to my LO. With this product I am sure that I am providing my LO with Good nutrition and Good taste.<br />He simply loves it .
5,It's gift for my princess.It tastes good and  baby love it.Packaging is also very carefully so they arrived home safely.
5,Our baby LOVES LOVES this food. We actually mix a jar with 1-2 scoops of rice cereal for breakfast and he gobbles it up. Earths best is the best!
5,"Great variety of fruits, and my 8 month old loved them all. We bought this assortment pack as well as the vegetable one and it lasted well over two weeks."
5,my son can not get enough of these fruit purees.  i can not think of a higher standard of praise for this product!
5,"I was very pleased with the price of this product. And the shipping speed was fast! I like that I didn't have to lug this back from the grocery store. Thanks, Amazon!"
5,"The bananas are a little runnier than most brands, but overall, my son loves this stuff.  And what a great price!"
4,"Liked the Baby food(yes for myself ;-P) really tasty and smooth consistency for an organic treat,except the Peaches and Apricots not soo much nice flavor and such.Really good though and timely shipping excellent buyer!!"
5,My baby loves Earth's Best product.  The food is tasty and doesn't cause her constipation problem.  I'm happy that I can find the organic and affordable food for my baby.
4,The flavor combinations are good and taste pretty good too.  I did not give it 5 stars because I thought the consistency of the pears was a bit thin and runny for stage 2.  That is easily solved if you mix the fruit with some cereal.  My little girl loves them.
5,"Great value if you buy it as a subscribe and save item, and I love that it automatically comes to me.  These are great and they taste really good, making me think that we bought a very high quality product for our child."
5,"We love Earth's best. Its hard to beat their variety of flavors and organic offerings. You can also buy a vegetable variety pack, gourmet meals, or my favorite, the seasonal! Good Price on Amazon too, especially if you do subscribe and save!!"
5,I like this one better than all the other ones by Earths Best. The variety is good and my son seems to enjoy them all.<br /><br />If i am going away for a weekend this is perfect for feedings. It is packaged well and again the variety helps!
5,The variety pack is the way to go when buying in bulk. My 9-month old daughter loves all of the flavors.
5,"I bought this for my 1 year old and he loves it just as much as the other organic brands we've purchased, but I got this one for 30-50% less!  Great buy."
5,"My son happily eats all of the fruit/veggie varieties of Earth's Best, unlike the Organic Baby products, none of which he likes at all.<br /><br />Be careful to only get the fruit and veggie variety packs, not the dinner packs, as they have meat in them."
5,We are huge fans of earth's best.  My daughter loves them.  It's a great variety.  I would definitely reccomend this
3,"I like their variety package, but also heard that there is BPA in the lid. I will switch to other BPA free products."
1,There is BPA in the lids and company claims it doesn't touch the food so it's okey. Why do they even write ORGANIC 6 times around the lid? Not honest to their costumer. I wouldn't even give 1 star if l could.
1,"This food is phenomenal but WAY overpriced. I pay $7.99 a case in New York City and it is often on sale for less than $6 a case at BabiesRus in New York City. Grocery prices are obscene in NY so if I am paying less here, this is no deal."
5,"They have a bad taste,i finish giving them away because my son started to cry everytime i tried to give these.I prefer Beech nut or Gerber.Yuck!"
5,"Unless you can use it all, plan on sharing. Great ingredient for my southwest spice mix recipes, and any dish you might want to spice up."
5,"Happy with this purchase, it's a good deal. It's the most fragrant coriander ever! Coriander is a super spice, tri-dosha (and a health supplement as well, research it, it's a ground cilantro seed). We use it in lots of dishes.<br />Thank you!"
5,This is the best-tasting brown rice I have ever had.  Kind of a nutty flavor.  This is the only rice I have ever had that tastes great all by itself.
3,"This is OK rice.  It cooks fairly well in my cooker, not as good as some other tho.  But the taste is really very earthy.  I don't mind that too much, but this is almost too strong tasting."
5,"This product is very good. I have really been pleased. As usual of Amazon,it arrived in good timely fashion. Thank you."
5,It is great thin and tasty brown rice. Just follow the recipe on the packet and it cooks perfect. Thank you.
2,I love fact that this drink is neither too tangy or tos sweet.The combimation of both is perfect and therefore quenches yor thirst  without leaving an unpleant after taste. t
5,My entire family and my extended family (Cousins) love the entire product flavor line. Why have they taken this product out of the stores? Several large food store chains have taken the products off their shelves. Why?
5,We absolutely love the sugar free cherry Kool-Aid but have a very hard time finding it in stores.<br />When we discovered it on line we bought a bunch. It is a wonderful product! Hope they keep making it!<br />Delicious!
5,I was going through about 2 litres per day of various soda drinks.  Switching to this has really brought down my caloric intake and I have dropped about 5kg with this being the only change in my diet.
5,i cant keep enough of this in my house. my kids drink it like its going out of style. i love it cause its so easy to make just water and the packet the best part is that is sugar free.
5,"The Tropical Punch flavor tastes just like I remember as a kid.  Easy to use, and fully dissolves in cold water (although I'll use a chopstick or knife to stir the mix while the water is filling)."
5,I love this kool-aid mix and they stopped selling it at my local Albertsons (boooooooooooo) luckily I found it here and it is even cheaper than it was in store!!
5,I chose to purchase in quantity as it is cheaper than the grocery store.  I liked the product so I knew what i was getting.
5,Great basic hydration for summer. Satisfied with the amount of sweetness. I mix with water and ice cubes for instant satisfaction.
5,My local Harris Teeter stopped carrying and said they could not get this product any more.  So happy to find it on Amazon.com!!
1,I would never buy this cake. It looks horrible. Some of the fondant work on this seller's other cakes is shabby the piping is horrible...worse than a cake you would buy at the grocery store. The flowers look like red and green blobs. How can you possibly think you should sell these to people?
4,"I have two indoor small dogs, Poodle and Maltese, and they have high anxiety, especially my maltese and these seem to help! Even if it doesnt they sure love 'em. My maltese before he ate it set it down and rolled all over it, I think he likes it! I'd give it 5 stars but its just a little pricey."
5,"This product is very flavorful and you don't need much of it in your recipe it's really strong, it's organic."
1,"Maybe it's just me, but I have used this extract in my oatmeal (same amount as McCormick extracts) and I can't taste any flavor at all.  Very disappointing."
5,I used this in making a wedding cake for some friends.  It tasted awesome mixed into the fodant!  I would purchase other flavorings from this vendor.
5,"arrived on time,smells like a good addition to my baking supplies.  came in excellent condition.  will use in syrups, etc."
4,We have been looking for pesto that tastes as good as what we had in Tuscany. This is from the same region as our favorite. The consistency is just a bit runny. It has moderate chunks of garlic. It was quite tasty!
3,"Good stuff, but may be a bit expensive in relation to more local products.  Love the no sugar added, but found product at local store for half the price.  Would continue to purchase if I did not have cheaper option."
5,This hit my sweet cravings perfectly. Definitely keeping this around. Yum.  I would definitely reccomend this to anyone wanting a quick snack that isn't a lot of calories.  Get the 94% fat free and it's only 100 calories.
5,"This popcorn is great, and even comes in Smart Pop at lower calories. I always have both for the me and the grandkids."
5,Our pediatrician recommended we feed our constipated 6 month old prunes. He wasn't too thrilled with the taste but it did the job:P
4,"I think BJs has a better deal on mixed fruit packs by Gerber, but if your child really loves peaches, this is great!"
1,I believe gerber may have mixed apricots with the peaches. It now has a sour after taste and my son hates it.
5,"These baby gummy bears are by far the best I've ever had. I had first purchased the 1.5 lb bag here, on Amazon, but I realized as soon as it arrived that it wasn't going to be enough. However 5 lbs on a subscription basis? Oh yeah."
5,These are the best gummie bears I have evvvveeerr had. We sell them where I work so I had to get my hands on some. The flavors are so vibrant and just pop in your mouth
2,They have some textured powder stuff on them that makes them taste bad.. bad after taste. I guess it's so they don't stick together. Never again
2,The taste is not horrible but it is not very good. There is not a very good mango flavor. I would not buy again.
5,Fennel tea is the best herbal tea I have been able to find and Seelect is the best-tasting brand of those I have tried.
1,This is not for me. It was like eating a bowl of fat. Not my preference. Everyone is different. Personally i dont like this at all.
2,"this egg pasta ingredient was ""powdered egg product"" and as such not as tasty as those containing the real thing.  i don't like anything powdered, but price was RIGHT.  can't have it all i guess."
5,My 2 cats really like this cat food best of all! I have regular deliveries in order to be sure to have an ample amount available.
3,"The cats don't like this flavor. I would have preferred an assortment of flavors. The product itself is good. I just have finicky cats. And I am weaning them off wet food, anyway. My older cat is getting too big! Notice I didn't say fat!  ;-)"
5,"This product is positively wonderful!  Use it anywhere you might use ordinary balsamic, but use it sparingly as it packs a very fruity punch.  Apply just a bit to some fresh berries and pour it over vanilla ice cream for a fantastic desert treat."
5,"Although I like olives, often I only want 3 or 4 due to their intense flavor. These olives have a great flavor that keeps you coming back for more. I love to snack on them at work and have no problem finishing the whole package each time."
1,"I was really disappointed in these olives. The are very mushy and I prefer a more firm texture. Cat Cora's olives are much, much better."
5,"The smell alone will make you salivate, it is that good. It comes with rock sugar mixed in, so I don't ever use any added sweeteners."
5,"It's difficult to find 20 words to say about Mauna Loa Macadamia Nuts, Milk Chocolate Toffee, other than DELICIOUS. They didn't last long. I'm not sure if that's a good thing or a bad thing."
5,"First, Yuban is my favorite coffee. To be able to buy a case and save is great. The coffee was in date, the seals on the cans were excellent, and the freshness of the coffee was excellent. I will definitely buy more Yuban coffee when I need it from Amazon groceries."
5,"This is the coffee we crave in our house. It is a strong brew, yet not bitter. Yuban is the best ground coffee we have tasted, yet."
5,And a great price from amazon. My wife and I had dinner last night at a very high end restaurant and while everything was magnificent we both thought the coffee wasn't as good as our Yuban. I often wonder about Starbucks whose coffee I find undrinkable. My son says it's an acquired taste.
4,"Great Price, The best Maxwell House makes. It is a very good coffee for the price, less then $3.50 a can."
5,"I love the taste of this coffee.  It does not have a bitter taste and the size of the can, which per ounce is the same as if you bought the large can, keeps it fresher as a smaller amount is exposed to the air."
5,"Yuban is one of the best coffees available, but not sold in all areas. Amazon's case price is unbeatable!!  I get a case every 8 weeks, always on time!!"
5,"I love cofee.  Yuban is one of the better ones. Maxwell House is also not too bad and there are some other ones that are pretty decent.  Yuban is rich, robust, and stronger than most other coffees I have tried yet not bitter. Overall, I highy recommend it."
5,"What can I say.  It's our favorite brand of coffee, it's affordable, and it's delivered to our door!  I think that pretty much sums it up."
5,We've been drinking Yuban since 1979 and find this the most convenient way to get it. The price is great and it faithfully comes every month.  If we are having guests we can bump up the order.  Fantastic.
5,Best coffee in the world.  When you open a can and sniff ---- ahhhhhhhhhhhhh!<br /><br />Can't go wrong with Yuban.
4,"Very good coffee.  Can't always find it in our local stores, so I order it thru Amazon every 3 months"
5,"This particular type of Yuban coffee is a mild, flavorful coffee that can be enjoyed in the morning or anytime.  It's the coffee my mother seems to prefer over all others.  Not always available in stores, I was thrilled when I found it for sale by Amazon!"
5,Yuban has been my coffee of choice for 20 years. The price at Amazon is very good. I recommend this product for any coffee lover.
5,I can no longer find Yuban on the Grocery shelfs.It is by far the best coffee Delicious flavor and no acid I would highly recommend Yuban
5,"Very good product, will purchase over and over again. A convenient way to purchase."
1,I've read the reviews and I agree that Yuban is absolutely the best coffee but at $100 for 12 cans comes to over $8 a can.  That's $3 more a can than I pay at my local store.  I don't understand the high price?
1,"I have never tasted this coffee.  But when people brew it in my house, it makes my house smell like farts.  It might taste really good, but I can't get over the fart smell.  You've been warned."
3,"The jar is much smaller than I imagined via pictures - I thought it was going to be the size of a mason jar, but it was instead much smaller. It is spicy though! Lots of jalapeno, not a lot of honey mustard!"
5,These sunflowers seeds are of a great quality in every bag and the flavor of the Salt & Pepper is very bold.  I love these and the shipping service from the company has been great every time I have ordered.
5,I have ordered this product twice now and the service and product have been great.  Would order again !!!<br />Price of product was comparable to others. Thank you....
4,"I gave these packs out as Christmas goodies, but saved myself one.  Delicious!  The gifts were well received also."
2,"The picture and description was Pure Butter Mini Shortbread Round, then I decided to order it because I love them so bad. But when i got the package, it came out at Mini CHOCOLATE CHIP shortbread which I don't like."
5,This is a terrific deal for a coffee lover that needs to cut back on his/her caffeine consumption.  Great tasting coffee and great deal.  Can spend over $5 for it at the grocery store.  I get mine by the subscription plan for a little over $4 plus no tax.
2,When Habanero is in powder form it doesn't taste the same nor does it have the same heat. It's almost physically impossible to get a Habanero powder to taste decent. Go with Habanero flakes instead. They taste better and pack a lot more heat.
5,"These are very healthy 7 grains and very light and crispy, perfect with dips or salsa.  Tastes just like rice cake.  They are very easy on the teeth too, for those who have dental work that they don't want to chip. Hard to find in supermarkets."
4,We are trying to curb our carbohydrates.  The Wasa Crisp'n Light is a big help.  Especially when you need something crisp.  We have and will continue to order this product.  Thanks Amazon for selling this tasty cracker.
5,"These crackers are very delicious, have a wonderful texture, adapt well to any spread, and they are only 20 calories each--great for people watching their calories.  They are very satisfying, and they contain whole grains in a tasty form."
5,"I really do love these crackers. They are crisp, tasty and low in calories. I have been eating them with a small bit of mayo and potted meat in the morning with my cappuccino. They have helped me lose weight. Regardless of that fact, I just like the taste."
5,My daughter absolutely loves this stuff and she is a very picky eater.  It is also hard to find in the supermarket.
5,"these crackers are perfect...you know why?<br />because they have a subtle light flavour that doesn't overpower whatever you're eating on top of them...whether it be guacamole, hummus, or mustard and cheese...  :)"
5,We love these crackers for our salmon spread.  They have just the right flavor and crispness to enjoy the taste of the spread.  And they're healthy!
5,"We love this crisp bread because it's made from 7 whole grains, does not contain any corn syrup and stays fresh for weeks after being opened. It's soft yet crunchy and tastes great. Can only recommend and will definetly buy again."
5,Since I am counting calories I find Wasa crisp'n light very tasty. You can eat three of them and feel like you are eating a lot more than you really are. I think the taste is great and have told all my friends about them.
5,once I tried these I was hooked. good healthy food that tastes good alone or with tuna or seafood salad. light crispy and melts in your mouth.
5,"Great low-carb alternative, they arrived fresh, and unbroken, I'm satisfied with Amazon and with purchase again."
5,"These little gems are only 20 calories each and almost fat free, and taste way better than a rice cake, IMHO.  I'm glad they come in packs of 10 boxes because otherwise the husband and kids would eat them all and there'd be none left for me!"
5,I love these crackers.  They're perfect when you want the light crunchy snack without the calories of other crackers.  They're good topped with lox or cinammon and sugar.
5,I order these peas and they came fast. the product<br />has a good flavor and I am very happy with the peas.<br />I will order with them again
5,"Great snack and good on salads.  It's dried peas, what else can I say?"
5,"Just wanted to compliment this company on their great, prompt service and the freshness of the cookies.. Bought them to give as a gift, and when i brought them home my kids ate them lol. I would recommend these cookies to anyone and everyone.."
5,"This is absolutely the best sauce for making Carolina BarB Q. I,ve looked for a long time and am glad that I finally found the best."
5,This mix makes a gravy that taste like your good ole southern grandmother made the gravy. No more lumps and everyone thinks you made it from scratch. If you are thinking about it you have to try this. It is the best thing since the invetion of peanut butter
5,"My wife always made her own gravy from scratch and is good at it. However, this gravy is fantastic, idiot proof (even I can make it) and reminds me of my grandma's cooking. My wife loves it and this will definitely be a new staple for our cupboard."
5,"Forever for the perfect easy peasy gravy mix.  This is my fave!  Tastes just like the restaurant ones I love so much;  Like Bob Evans, and IHOP."
5,"This is a very delicious gravey mix. I add a pound or so of browned, drained breakfast sausage after it is heated and serve over bisquits. It is super fast and easy. I serve with cut up fresh fruit and there you have a simple, quick breakfast or brunch meal! I would highly recommend."
5,The gravey is wonderful.  It taste just as good and the one from Scratch.  Except it is not as greasy
5,"Very good taste and a good price, no sales tax, no shipping charges and delivered to my door"
5,The Southern Mills gravy is  a very satisfying gravy for an easy fast topping for either bisquits or hashbrown potatoes.<br /><br />The mix is easy to use and there are never any left overs. It hits the table and it is gone.... everyone seems to love it.
3,I'm a huge fan of the McCormick brand gravy mix and I assumed that this would be as good.  It isn't.  It's not bad enough for a 2 but i'm annoyed that i convinced myself to buy a case of this stuff instead of the McCormick.
5,"This is such a nice change from ordinary ketchup. More pizzaz! I've been putting it on everything...... it's great on eggs and hash browns. I'm glad I bought 6 bottles. Shared some, and am going through the rest pretty fast. It's hard to find locally."
5,"Really good quality tea.  Much superior to Twinings as tea.  The releasable plastic lined paper bag is much superior to the tins to keep excess air out.  This is important so the tea won't oxidize.  The tins look nice, but they hold too much air and don't reseal like a plastic zip seal."
5,"Beautiful clear reddish in the cup and delicious with no off taste or ""bite"".  Recommended without hesitation.  Just opened the bag, and I'm ordering some more already."
2,"The price is right. Organic Tea at a great price, but that's as far as it goes. I've tried about 5 of the Davidsons so far and they just lack character."
5,Perfect mid morning snack for someone like me who is currently doing a meal replacement drink for breakfast. One of these and piece of fruit is just what you need to get you to through to lunch.
5,"These are wonderful!  But, they are small, so I usually eat 2 at at time.  And... will melt easily and are hard to get off the paper.  So, I keep them in the fridge.  LOVE THEM!!"
1,"While the product is delicious, it's annoying that the peanut butter stays on the waxy paper instead of on the product. You need a fork to scrape the peanut butter off the protective top sheet."
3,"First of all, these things are delicious. However, opening them without making a mess is nearly impossible. They're super crumbly, so open the package with care. I won't buy them again. There are too many other good options that are way less messy."
5,We have been trying several chilis by small companies via Amazon and this one so far is our favorite.  I added some non-soy meat substitute crumbles and that gave it a very nice texture.
5,Purchased this product at a local store in NY and my kids and i love it. Its a quick easy meal. You can put in a toaster oven on toast for 6 min. and its ready to eat.<br />strongly recommend
5,"I really love this oatmeal, it is such a lovely treat. Quick and easy to prepare and delicious as an ingredient for smoothies and even in flapjacks, a must buy!!"
5,"My 2 GF/DF girls love this instant oatmeal. We have tried MANY MANY brands for a quick breakfast option and this one is by far the best. It is a bit sweeter than old fashion oatmeal, but not overbearing by any means!  Great start to the day!"
5,Yay an all natural Kids Gum .  NO BHT Preservative ! No dangerous artificial sweetners .  Tastes fine and not bad for you !
5,It's all natural real food that you can see the difference. My cat loves it so much that now we call him the tiki kitty.
4,The cats love it. I could live without the smell and seeing the pieces of cut up fish in it but the cats love it.Wish I would have purchased more the price was right and it is good quality food for them.
5,My finicky calico just LOVES this food.  One of the few wet foods she will actually eat. It is loved by our other three cats as well.  Will definitely be buying this again.
5,My cat Tigger eats this stuff up fast. Then he asks for more so I figure it must be good. This is not your typical cat food!
5,"My cat loved this food for a long time. However, he has been picky lately. It's been harder and harder to get him to eat this, but the variety offered in this cat food is good and seemed to keep my cat healthy!"
2,She liked the food a little at first but didn't want much to do with it... The price is very high and not worth it if she'll only eat a couple of bites. She had tried most of the flavors and would always have the same reaction.
5,Tried this in a turkey burger and it was sooo good. I definitely recommend faery free. Salt can be added or better yet add a sprinkle of Goya Adobo.
5,"There are a ton of vanilla beans in this package. They are supple and so fragrant, you can smell them without breaking the seal. Truly a fantastic deal."
5,"Just received my beans today and wow!  There's an amazing amount for the price paid, they smell absolutely fantastic and came vacuum packed so they'll keep practically forever."
1,This product smells so bad that I couldn't even try to consume it.  It smells sour and rancid and is detectable even before the package was opened.  The seller has a no return policy so I'm out the $ I spent on this as it will go right into the garbage.
5,"I just got these, they are moist and gooey and fresh.  I actually got more beans than the approximate ammount.  They came faster than expected.  Great transaction!"
5,I was very happy with the quick delivery of this product and how fresh the beans were.  I am looking forward to my homemade vanilla extract once it is done brewing.  I would definitely buy from this seller again.
5,Got 58 beans in the 1/2 lbs package which is a great value. They are moist so they are super fresh. Great Find.
5,I received my beans quickly and they smelled great!  I used all of them pretty quickly.  I purchased three 1.75 l bottles of vodka and split the beans evenly among them. They were plump and looked great.  I'm excited to give my homemade vanilla as Christmas gifts.
5,I received these wonderful beans today through Amazon.  I have not opened the vacuum sealed bag yet but the fragrance is divine.  They are about 6-3/4 inches long and plump and soft. It looks like there are maybe 60-70 beans.
5,"Arrived very quickly and packaged safely.  They are vacuumed sealed and then put within a thick plastic ziplock bag.  Even with the packaging I could smell the vanilla when I opened my UPS box.  There are so many beans in here, a very great buy for my homemade vanilla extract!!"
5,"I got these 2 weeks ago, for the price i wasnt expecting much, but they are really fresh and fragrant<br />i've used them to make bavarian cream and creme brulee and they taste great."
5,"The beans smell great and you get a lot of them. If you get a 12 pack of jars and you put 2 beans in each jar, you will still have more than half of them left over. Im trying to figure out what else I can do with them before they go bad."
5,Great price.  Wonderful product.  Everything was as described.  Shipped quickly and was priced great as far as I can tell.  I use these to infuse vodka. (slice the beans down their length first).  Wonderful!
5,This is the buy of a lifetime.  $25 for about 50 beans instead of $10 for 2!  And the flavor was great.  Made ice cream that everyone raved about.  I vacuum sealed portions for future use to keep them as fresh as possible.
5,"These are unbelievably fantastic!  I had to share them, I had so many!  simply the BEST! I put the leftover pods in my sugar, smells amazing!"
5,"These beans are trully wonderful and wonderfully priced. Split a few down the length toss in a bottle of Vodka or Rum or some Bourbon for a few days and you have a wonderfull drink. Great for baking , make truly amazing vanilia bean cookies."
5,These will last a long time the way we use them but could not pass up the deal..came sealed and you could still smell the vanilla...stick one or 2 in your favorite vodka and wait a few weeks...we also make our own extract from them.
5,"well packaged, and alot of beans for the price(50+).  using them to make home made vanilla extract.  wounderfull flavor. will buy again."
5,"The beans arrived in good time, moist and supple, no mold, very good flavor.  What else is there to want in regular bourbon vanilla beans?  I was very pleased with this purchase."
5,Can't be the price!  The beans have a strong aroma and tasted GREAT in creme brulee!  Just be sure to have an air-tight jar and a vacuum sealer isn't a bad idea either to keep them as long as possible.
5,"I got these beans based on the good reviews and wasn't disappointed. I also got 70 beans in my pouch, nice moist and supple pods that will make a gallon of vanilla extract. Great beans for a great price!!!"
5,I could smell the vanilla even through the packaging!<br />There were lots of vanilla beans and they were all in great shape.  I'm excited to see how my homemade vanilla extract turns out!
5,"Cooking with fresh ingredients always makes your dishes taste, and smell, more delicious!  Highly recommend purchasing these vanilla beans, they arrived vacuum packed and ready to use."
5,"These beans were amazing for the price.  Plump, moist and delightful smelling. Made 1.5L of extract with them using silver rum for the alcohol."
5,I was very pleased when I got these vanilla beans. They were shipped in a timely manner and arrived vacuumed sealed. There was a mix of some very plump beans and a few that were thin. I was very happy with my purchase!
5,"These beans were vacuum sealed, very fresh and supple.  My only problem was that there were so many I had way more than what I needed for a dozen jars of vanilla flavoring that I'm preparing as Christmas gifts. Highly recommend."
5,"Better than expected! Well packaged, moist, fresh and fragrant beans were just what I needed for my recipe. Perfect. Would not hesitate to order this bargain-priced, excellent product again."
5,"These bean smelled so fresh, they were moist and plump.  I'm very impressed with the quality of the beans that were shipped to me.  I can't wait to use them in all of my baked goods!"
5,I LOVED this . The beans where fresh and the smell heavenly. I most definately would buy this again. The more expensive ones in the supermarket are dry and way over priced. These were very juicy. Loved it!!
5,I like to eat frozen vanilla yogurt but the catch is that I have to make it myself or it doesnt get done.<br /><br />These vanilla beans are amazing if you are really into vanilla.yougurt or icecream
5,"I have always liked the oskri bars... but these with the fennel in them are even tastier.  A great gluten free, no cane SUGAR, no cornsyup, treat for those being health conscious.  Also get a little protein to boot!  MMMmmmm MM!"
3,I don't really like the chunks of cherry and pistachios.  I'd just rather have the plain dark chocolate.  I think the plain dark is the best dark chocolate sugar free bar available today.
5,"I babysit for my good friends' kids, to give them a 'date night' every now and again.<br /><br />These things are always in their freezer b/c they know I am a horrible cook. I always thought 3 year olds were picky eaters, but the twin boys beg me to heat up 2nds for them!"
5,"My daughter loves them. They are easy to heat up and good for the body and earth. It's the perfect weekday dinner for us busy mums. And it's so clean to eat, that's the key. Not as messy as mac n' cheese. Thanks Peas of Mind to make my life easier."
5,Universally popular with all dogs and is the only treat my pets will eat.  Great that it is all natural.
5,The best treats available. Your dogs will go bonkers for these. I buy a tub a month for my little munchkins and they just love it. Good value online.
1,Anyone see where theses are made? - I am avoiding treats from China because of all the problems lately. and I do not see a country of origin here.
5,"My 3 Boston Terriers LOVE these treats!  They are natural, wholesome and soft enough to break into multiple pieces.  We keep a steady supply of them in the house ... I order at least 2 containers at a time since we don't want to run out.  Amazon's seller -- All Pets -- has the best price around."
5,"At an early age my Beagle (yes, a beagle) was picky about eating.  crushing a little freeze dried chicken liver on his food gave him the incentive to eat.  Now it has become part of the routine."
5,I buy chicken livers for my cat. She has now learned to speak English persuasively in order to get these treats.(lol) They are economical and obviously well liked by my cat.
4,"My dog absolutely loved these, and he would have given them a 10 rating if he could.  Unfortunately he is nolonger with us, but he thought they were great for years, and this was the best price I ever found.  Very prompt shipping, and adequate packing"
5,My pugs are picky eaters and only like the chicken liver which is hard to find.  This is a great deal.
5,"It came promptly, dog is very happy.  For some reason, this batch has much smaller pieces than those that we have ordered in the past.  I guess the dog thinks that is better he gets more treats at one time (even though the amout is about the same)."
5,"This is a very very good tea, bearing the name Sibu. English tea is really nice and really really really really really good."
5,Awesome tasting Tea in a 16 oz. can!  I highly recommend this product because it taste great and doesn't cost a lot.
4,"Prince of Tea brand teas are great. The premium oolong tea is good, but I found that I like their organic oolong to taste better than the premium, and it generally costs less too. Prince of Tea is a well known and environmentally concious company and you'll do well to buy their products."
5,"I drink three cups of this each day, made with one Oolong tea bag and one green tea bag, in a large mug.  I believe this has helped me to lose about 8 lbs. in the last five months.  I drink it without sweeteners, and also cold. The price for this is very reasonable, and the taste is mild."
5,Unexcelled as to price and equal in quality to the best !
5,The tea tastes great hot or iced.  Very good for the price.  I recieved the package fast with no problems.
5,"The Natural Balance Alpha Grain-free Trout, Salmon meal and Whitefish Formula is working very good for my dog. There is no digestive problems. It also keeps the fur shinny. Be sure to provide a lot of water for the dog as he always drinks a lot an hour or two after the meals."
5,Works good in the blender for shakes and ice slush.<br /><br />Can not find decaf in stores.<br /><br />Can add other flavors and spices to  taste.<br /><br />Good for nutrition builder.
5,"These are so good, my next order will be on the monthly schedule.<br />Very easy to make and super delicious. We used milk and chipped<br />ice, along with the mix. I might try water one time to see how<br />that is. I wish I could rate this product higher than 5 stars."
5,"I used to go to a local coffee shop to get these drinks for about $4. Now I can make them at home for a fraction of the cost. They are delicious! I like the single serving packets, but my husband and I end up using three packets to make two good size drinks."
5,This product is delicious!  It is the frappacino mix a lot of independent coffee shops use.  You will not be disappointed.
5,"Always a fan of La Tourangelle oils, this time the hazelnut oil was received as a gift via Amazon.<br /><br />Not only is the oil wonderful and delicate for salads, and some sauteeing, Amazon now packages the cans to come dent free and protected.<br /><br />Great buy!"
5,The toasted flavor is so much better than regular walnut oil; the price is the best I can find and we store it in the fridge for longer life.
5,"So happy I got this on a subscription. I might even have to increase the frequency that it is delivered. I've used it in everything from scrambled eggs to brownies. It's not mild like olive oil, but it has enhanced the flavor of everything I've cooked!"
5,The walnut oil is really good. I later will often come to buy it.I hope you will like it too.
5,"Enjoyed the product, pleasant flavor,  used it to in all my cooking, i will be purchasing it again. Cans were dented on arrival... but did not harm the product."
5,"I had bought small cans previously and they arrived inadequately packaged, so they all had tiny dents. These, however, arrived undented, well-packaged in bubble wrap. I have not yet opened them, but I have used the small cans. This oil is great quality, and the price is not overblown. Recommended."
5,"the walnut oil has a wonderful taste to it.  I have used it in salads, salad dressing, couscous, and a variety of other things.  Thank you for a wonderful product.  Definately worth the money."
5,We ordered this on our Doctor's recommendation and take a tablespoon every day as a supplement. It's supposed to have several omega acids.Also tasty on salads.
5,Walnut oil is an essential ingredient in our favorite waffle batter. This oil is the best we've used for the price. GREAT aroma!!!
5,"great product and priced well, we've ordered this several times over the past few years and really like their walnut oil,  packaged well and ships on time, will keep ordering this product from the same seller"
5,I love the walnut oil. It came in cans which i like a lot because you hardly see them any more. The walnut oil was better quality than any of the walnut oil I bought in my neighbourhood and cheaper even with the shipping charge. I recommend it to anyone.
5,La Tourangelle makes some really good oils. I like this company alot...try the sesame oil too.
5,"what a fresh smell and a very pleasant taste.<br />it,s very good for you too. I use it in place of olive oil, for salads and cooking."
5,This is a great oil for baking it gives a nutty flavor. It also works great in dressings much better than olive oil.
3,I found the oil a bit weak in taste. I had expected a stronger walnut flavor. I hope it is not chemically produced like most truffle oils.
2,"I really wanted to like this, as it was organic, and came in a glass bottle, but there was hardly any flavor at all. I could barely smell it, and even when I poured a generous amount on my dish, it imparts little to no truffle flavor/aroma. My truffle salt is much more potent."
5,I enjoyed the carbonation with a hint of blackberry and liked the fact there are no calories or artificial sweeteners.
1,This was not good. The flavor was lacking and barely came through unlike the Hint water -- which I really enjoy. I wanted this to be good and was so excited to get it but it just disappointed.
5,This is awesome! it really helped my daughter gain the much needed weight for a reasonable price. Will do business again :)
5,"Glad to find this for a birthday present as hard to find decaf ones in store.<br /><br />Makes good ice slushy and milk sakes cold.<br /><br />For those who can not take decaf, these are , and making them at home sure beats Starbucks prices."
5,This coffee mix is so easy to make and taste great.  I enjoy ALL their flavors as my kids do too.  Hard to keep around.  Buying a box of it at a time helps.
2,"Personal preference... too sweet.  Tastes like General Foods International Coffees.  Price is great if you like that, though.  And makes up very easy."
3,This product was okay tasting. My problem with it was the 10 oz container with less than 6 oz of sprinkles. Really?!?
5,"Strong, dark, intense. Strong enough for a man but mellow enough for a woman. It really is a good coffee with no bitter after taste. I just love it. It's good with cream and sweetner with no watered down taste or just plain. Wish they made a decaf then I could drink it 24/7."
4,"If anyone is looking for delicious and healthy snack, Doctor Kracker is an answer.  However, the hard crispiness is for people with good teeth."
5,"Have tried many crackers, including some other Dr. Kracker, and think this tastes the BEST.  It's hard/crunchy with lots of seeds on it, so if that's an issue, it might not be for everyone.  Buying it in Amazon's 6-pack makes it less expensive than purchasing in the store."
5,"I eat them just like this!  I like something with substance to it, and when you eat these, you know you're eating something.  They're healthy, taste good, and are reasonably priced."
5,This is one of the best dried organic crackers around. Highly recommend them compared to other available types of similar products.
5,"Could not stop eating these after the first taste!  High quality ingredients make a big difference.  Love the crunch and the seeds.  The subtle sweetness is nice too, much less heavy-handed than in most products."
5,Love these crackers and all of the Dr Kracker products.  I use Subscribe and Save to save a little bit of money and to insure that I don't run out.  I pretty much eat one every day instead of bread.  My current favorite topping is goat cheese!
5,These are delicious and filling. I first had them in Hawaii a few weeks ago but then couldn't find them when I got back home to Philly. Amazon had them and a good selection. If you are a seed and nut eater and like a crispy cracker you will love these. Enjoy!
5,These are the only crackers that I buy.  So Healthy and so good.  Eat them with a salad and you have the perfect lunch.
5,These crackers are a great healthy snack without anything spread on them. My only dislike is that they are a tad too sweet for me. I'd like them without the molasses.
5,Outstanding product...I am always going to have them around.  Far and above most crackers for taste and good nutrition.
5,"This flatbread is just delicious. I love all the various seeds, very crunchy. There is a hint of sweet but in a delicious way."
5,"This is an excellent product. It is healthy, delicious, has a great texture and feel in your mouth and goes perfectly with hummus or other spreads!"
5,Just tried the Doctor Kracker seedlander crackers today and they are delicious! I'm going to try their other flavors soon. Can't believe how good these are.
5,These crackers rock.  Wish company would let you buy assortment since you have to buy minimum of 6 boxes at a time.
5,"These are the best crackers I've ever eaten.  two crackers spread with cheese feel like a meal to my belly. I spread them with aged bleu cheese, omg good!  Why have I never tried or even seen these before?"
5,"I make a bowl of McCann's every morning in the little crockpot for my breakfast; add a banana, and it's perfect!!  Try it and you'll never eat 'the other stuff' again!!"
4,Purchased case of 6 cans from Amazon.com for [...]  bucks including shipping.<br />Good quality slow cooking oatmeal. Good shelf life on cans. This is the slow cooking type 20-40 minutes depending on preference. Taste is good.
5,Very satisfied with this product ; excellent flavor and texture; recomment for those looking for good  breakfast choice
5,I ordered these for my upcoming wedding candy buffet. I am doing all navy and white and these go perfectly. They are individually wrapped and a true navy color. The packaging was great. Each lollipop is wrapped in bubble wrap. Love them!
5,"These lollipops are are well done, look exactly like the picture. Not a single one was broken! They packaged each lollipop so nicely, very impressed!"
5,Perfect! These are great vintage looking lollipops for our vintage wedding. Good quality. Pic on Amazon selling page is what you get.
2,"I don't think it's EB, I think it's Amazon. I buy EB from Babies R Us, Target and Whole Foods, and haven't had any problems. It's only the shipments from Amazon that come moldy."
5,"If baby likes that's what matters! Happy baby! Happy mommy! Only thing is the color of food that stain anything, but, oh, well, just washed right the way!"
3,"I've read other reviewers comment on the calorie content of this flavor and it must be high because when I was trying to wash the dish I served it in in was quite oily.  Also, it has a bit of a grainy texture and I think my 6 month old son finds the spinach a little difficult to digest."
4,"I purchased this product from B-R-US when it was on sale and my son seems to like it. I was scared of previous post of mold and I ALWAYS double check the food before I stir and serve. He seems to like it, but I recommend the Chicken Sweet Potato dinner."
5,My picky eater LOVES this flavor.  Each jar is 110 calories & 5 grams of fat so this momma LOVES this flavor as well.  I'm ordering more because it's the one flavor (besides green beans) that I know my son will eat.
5,This is a terrific baby food.  It has beef and spinach AND tastes great!  It was the first meat baby food my son would eat.  I tasted it myself and it's quite good.
5,My baby is 8 months and I purchased the gourmet meals pack. She really liked this one best out of all of them.
5,My daughter loves this!  She is picky so she doesn't always eat as many healthy foods as she should.  This flavor gives her the vegetables and protein that she needs.  It is a little bit grainier than other stage 2 foods but still very usable for babies over 6 months.
5,"I have never had a problem with anything from Amazon.  I have ordered about 30 cases of Earth's best baby food.  This is the most tasty and nutritious variety they offer.  5 grams of protein, and 15% iron! I have it on my subscribe and save.  He can't get enough of this, he eats it everyday!"
1,"Earth's Best is supposed to be one of the best baby foods, but apparently my son does not have a palate for their food.  Maybe he did not like the texture of this stuff (it looks gritty).  He normally eats anything but was very sluggish with this food...turning his head after a couple of bites."
1,It was bad before we open them. I saw them when we got. I did open. It had some spot green color. I did not know what it was. I was very upset. Do not buy this product.
5,We live in the middle of nowhere so we end up ordering a lot of spices etc. that can't be found locally.  This gives great chipotle taste with just a little sprinkled on.  I'm going to order a few more of these because I never want to run out of it.
5,"The breeder of my puppy uses this, and I continued to feed with this supplement. Dog loves the taste, and makes her boring dry food more interesting- she gobbles it up. I notice her coat is beautiful. Good ingredients. I would recommend this."
2,This is for puppies the bag is super small!!!The bag didn't last more than a day. I thought it was funny when I got the bag I thought it was a gift to be honest!!!
5,My dogs love these and even my allergy dogs can eat them too !!<br />thanks for have these on your site again 5 stars! and paws up for old mother hubbard  & Wellness treats<br />thanks<br />Pepper Love
5,Use these as treats for my five labs.  Use only this type as they contain the ingredients I am looking for and are a great size for labs.  Ordered them for years.  Dogs love them.
3,My dogs really did not care for these. were not real p-nutty.
5,"I'm not much of a chocolate and peanut butter person, but these chocolates are the perfect combination of both.  The different flavors have definitely made me a fan."
5,Bought this for my chocolate lover boyfriend and he loved it ! he shared it with me and they were delicious. Thank you!
5,some of the best chocolates i ever tasted. If you are a chocolates lover then you have to try these
5,"You can taste the quality and care that goes into these chocolates. Great flavor, I highly recommend it. You have to try for yourself!"
1,I am big coffee lover.  This was some of the worst coffee I have ever had.  It smells wonderful but the taste is horrible.  I would not recommend purchasing this coffee at all.
5,"i love that i can get both flavors in one container. and at the asians store around where i'm at they go for about a buck, sometimes more. so this is definitely a good deal and even cheaper when you subscribe and save"
5,"Same stable and good quality of Meiji Yan Yan. When I got the good deal from Amazon.com, the price is even better than those available in local Asian store, which is really rare."
5,"I bought these for my son's 12th birthday party favor/goodie bag.  It's hard to put together a goodie bag for 12 year old boys, but this is something that everyone likes!"
5,"It's exactly what I wanted. It's yummy. Make sure you eat your chocolate dip before the strawberry, because you won't like it the other way around. It's perfect."
5,"This mix is easy to prepare and very tasty. The only prep work consists of cutting up a zucchini which takes less than a minute. The seasoning is excellent, very flavorful but not too spicy. Sometimes low-salt mixes are spiced up with a lot of pepper but not this one. Excellent for vegetarians."
2,"Several of the seller's listings indicate 20% Kona blend.....but the delivered product does NOT have this package printing.<br />As a long-time Kona coffee drinker, the contents are more indicative of 10% (or less) Kona coffee. Have ordered twice....and completely disappointed."
5,My dog loves this flavor. Quality of cookie overall is very good. This particular smell drives him crazy!! On Amazon I get much chipper than in a store.
5,"Dogs love them and they are made the best way, They are about $4.00 cheaper that the pet stores and no tax"
5,"Old Mother Hubbard treats are the best and at a reasonable price. Their treats come in a lot of different sizes and flavors. They offer a variety of products that all dogs will love. My three black labs love the peanut butter and Bac'N""Cheez."
5,We live an hour away from any stores that would carry this product so it's easier and cheaper than making the trip.
3,"It definitely smells like dark chocolate but the taste is just average.... I can't say I taste the ""dark chocolate decadence"".... And it's not that strong but usually I like stronger tasting coffee."
4,We like to mix this with regular coffee because it's so strong and rich by itself that it makes it go further and isn't too overpowering.
5,"Another great hit from Coffee masters!  This one has a rich, dark chocolate flavor that's not too intense but just right.  The coffee is foll-bodied and very smooth.  I will definitely order more from Amazon."
5,"I have really fallen for flavored coffees and I consider these to be some of the best-- so much so that I'm on the regular shipment list now.  I'm sure I drink too much of this but I love the flavors.  Try it, I'm sure you'll like it."
5,"We really like this coffee, it has great flavor and we make it strong. We do the subscribe thing and it works out about right."
5,"This like yummy homemade hot cocoa, with the benefit of being a delicious cup of coffee, too!  This is a GREAT deal!  Get it while it lasts!  Good to the last drop, you could say!<br />Enjoy!"
1,You have to put a lot of sugar in  this to make it taste good. The coffee just by itself kind if has a stinky smell like a poopy diaper or a pee pee poo poo puppy in a cup. Next time I am going for raspberry flavored coffee...cause the chocolate is like poop. YUCK.
5,"My female Pixie Bob cat, Pawnee, is extremely finicky about her canned food.  She will touch nothing but Instinct's rabbit formula, and licks her plate clean each morning.  The Instinct brand is nothing but the best, whether it is a canned formula or dry."
5,"The vet recommended rabbit-based food for my cat, and that is difficult to find.  She seems to be allergic to chicken and the regular cat food menu.  Unfortunately, she's not crazy about this food, but that's just because she's a spoiled brat cat."
5,"This is a great source of essential fatty acids without the unpleasant tasting burps of fish oil or flax seed oil, which also doesn't agree with my stomach.  I also think it helps my IBS symptoms."
5,"I take it every day. I used to take fish oil but when I made the change to plant based oil for my body, it was like night and day. I felt the change, and loved it."
5,I purchased the hemp oil for my mom to help with pain relieve. The Omega oils are suppose to help with join movement and pain. I have noticed that when she takes the vitamin her pain is less than the times that we are out and she has to wait.
5,I Love this brand....and please tell EVERYONE you know...Hemp oil is sooooo beneficial for you...do your research...you will understand that getting 3 Omegas and some
4,It is hard to tell most of the time if supplements work but I just have a greater sense of well being when I take this product. It really is a good source for essential fatty acids. I expect to keep taking it.
5,"I've tried most of the Virginia chutney Co. (VCC) product range and particularly like their spicy plum chutney. It is good with cold meats, salads, cheddar cheese, and curries"
5,"One of my favorite restaurants serves this tea iced. They were kind enough to share the brand name with me when I asked. It makes wonderful, refreshing and healthful iced tea. Highly recommend."
3,Have had this gum from other sources and always liked it. This particular shipment seems to have much less peppermint flavor than before...could be it is older gum(there is no expiration date on it) or they are making it with less peppermint now. Otherwise I received this order very quickly.
1,The advertised regular price of $99.99 is ridiculous.  5 hour energy drinks are widely available for $2.00 each.  Don't buy from sellers who inflate prices and charge ridiculous amounts.  You can get a case of 12 for $20 right here on Amazon.
5,"although the taste leaves something to be desired, 5-hour energy worked very well.  i drank one halfway through my workday, and pepped up enough to go out and wash the ambulance.  my arms hurt later that night, but the product itself worked for me."
5,well u get the energy u really want for the 5 hours and it really boast u a bit but that u will be calm again and need to rest.. not bad great product
4,"The energy drink is a great product. The shipping price is crazy tho. I paid more for the shipping then both products together, so not a great deal."
5,"Finally, a product that gives you that extra boost you need for anything from travel delays to the overdue stack of paperwork. You feel the effects instantly with more energy and a higher concentration level.  It stays with you and does not leave you feeling dopey or spent when it wears off."
5,This is the best energy product I have ever used. It starts working right away and keeps you going for a long time.
3,"I took it at 5am yesterday. It is now almost 3am the next day and I am laying in bed and skin feels tingly, can't sleep at all. I feel like I am at super sayan level 4, power of the red monkey. I could shoot ki blast out the window if I wanted too. Maybe some kame hame wave's too."
5,"This is the moistest, most delicious cake in the world.  if you like almond tarts, marzipan, that kind of taste, you will be in love with this cake.  Normally I think packaged cake is awful, by the way.  This one is amazing."
5,Put two tablespoons. in a large cup of fresh coffee and you have a great coffee mocha.  I have recently tried several others that have been recommended and got great customer reviews online.  None are as good as this one.
5,This is the best hot chocolate next to Cadbury bought in Europe.  Our 13 yr old would never drink her chocolate milk until we switched to this (unfortunately we don't have a steady supply of Cadbury's).  It's great!
5,We appreciate the short list of ingredients on the Ghiradelli hot chocolate mixes.  The Chocolate Mocha flavor is rich and chocolatey with out being overpowered by the coffee.  This is one of our favorite cold weather drinks.
3,I did not expect this hot chocolate to be quite as sweet as I found it to be. It also has more calories than previous Ghiradelli similar hot chocolate.<br />It has a rich taste and if I were not concerned with weight I would overlook the higher calories.
5,"I love this hot chocolate. In my opinion, it's the best on the market.  It has a nice grown-up flavor of chocolate and coffee."
5,Love this hot chocolate. Made with skim milk for a healthier delicious hot drink. Creamy and tasty. Will never go back to supermarket hot chocolates.
5,"This is absolutely the best hot chocolate out there. It is not too sweet, so more for adults than for kids. Easy to make. Just add milk. No intense mixing required. Dissolves easily."
5,"Great deal and great transaction!  Finally, an affordable way to indulge my chocolate craving.  Will definitely buy this again!"
5,"I made this for my 12 year old grandson.  ""Grandma this is the best hot chocolate I have ever had in my whole life!""  You can guess what he got for Christmas.  It really has a wonderful flavor.  Top it off with whipped cream."
5,"Best mix on the market for making cafe mocha lattes, and we've tried them all"
5,"The best hot chocolate,by far.. Not so easily available in my area.<br />Love the mocha & the double chocolate"
5,"Easy to use (do not abuse),<a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000H27NU6"">Ghirardelli Chocolate Premium Hot Cocoa Mix, Double Chocolate, 16-Ounce Tins (Pack of 4)</a> great taste. It makes you to feel good."
3,"love the contents, but two of eight containers were badly dented.<br /><br />jan"
5,"Great product! Love making this during the fall and winter months because the smell goes through the entire house reminding me of Christmas. Taste great too especially when warm and with cream cheese. Have made it for co-workers who always rave about it. It's easy to make up, too."
5,"I cannot tell you how many of these I made between Thanksgiving and Christmas!  Fast, convenient and SO DELICIOUS!  I got rave reviews!  Thanks!"
1,I bought this product and when it arrived it was not organic.  BEWARE!  The package shown in the photo is not an organic product.
4,This is the perfect size for a snack bag for school.  Minus one star because the glue for the straws also glues the wrapper to all of the boxes.  That's annoying.
5,"I wonder if the other reviewer's order got mixed up at the warehouse or something?  We received organic juice boxes, just like the title says."
5,I absolutely love the Peanut Butter and Strawberry Kind bars! They taste just like a peanut butter and jelly sandwich!
5,"oh man, i love this candy! it's super delicious, but its really not that sour. I'd always collect a giant cache of quarters and spend it all on these for 50 cents each! =)"
3,"so anyways, i wished that i could find ginseng tea more easier, but for the price excluding the shipping i suppose its allright. comes in a weird form, not powder kinda like small bits of grass. Taste fine not sour or sweet"
5,Packed poorly in shipping and a few had the seal broken because they were rolling around in the box!
5,"Very good lemonade mix.  Close to fresh in taste.  Love that it has stevia.  I like it so much more than crystal light or any of the other mixes with artificial sweeteners.  I can take it anywhere, mix it in bottled water, and have a refreshing, healthy, safe, cool drink."
4,My dogs loved these...they were cheap too.  Only problem is they are oily to the touch...given they outside is great!
3,This was a christmas present for my son in law who collects super hero stuff. He was surprised but really liked it.
5,"I am hooked on it.  It's just wonderful.  Highly recommended for taste and flavor and price.  I've tried different teas from different restaurants and tea houses, but I just love this one for home.  I use it nearly every day.  Will be trying more of these teas in the future."
5,This carrot juice is the best.  I've tried so many other brands and this is the tastiest.  We love the Carrot/orange and the Super Veggie too. It's healthy and great tasting...can't get better then that.
1,"I don't know how they did it - but this is by far the worst tasting carrot juice I have ever had.  I think it has to do with the long shelf life - expires in 2012, I drank it in 2010 (well I tried to drink it).  It was probably bottled in 2007 or something.<br /><br />YYEECCHH!!"
3,Been waiting for this to be shipped for over 30 days.  Might be OK - hard to tell unless they send it.
5,"They are very hard to find but whenever I do I try to stock up. Great flavor, perfect for munching on and still pretty healthy. Highly recommended."
5,Product contains 70% of adult requirement for iron in one tablespoon; yet is safe and gentle on the digestive system.  Ordered and sent to my 82 year-old mother who had had some problems with diverticulitis.  She took three tablespoons a day for a week then tapered down.  She felt stronger in days!
1,"I bought this molasses at a local grocery store and nowhere on the bottle does it state that it is, 'unsulphered'. I called the company and talked to a sales rep in which he stated that it was not unsulphered. Although it does have a higher percentage of iron, I'm going back to Plantation."
5,"Its a great product.I would recommend this to everyone who wants a tasty sweetner other than sugar.I just started using it,taste so good,the jar is almost finished."
5,"It is a tiny bit grainy .. but it doesn't bother me a bit, my kids really like it - I use this as a ""chocolate syrup"" substitute in my kids milk to make the box go further - they really love it - it's great drinking it full strength too.  Not too sweet.  We love it!"
5,I love this ricemilk.  It has the consistency of almond milk and no soy.
5,"I am a Saba fan.  It is expensive for this but the intensive flavor given to salad dressings, dips, etc is without equal.  Use your imagination for this fruity/astringent addition.  The only responsibily bad results is yours for poor execution."
5,This is the second time that I ordered this product and I've been very happy with it.
5,"Licorice freakin rocks man, i like to take the licorice ropes and choke my self till im blue, then chew my way out. man this stuff is like crack, i just want roll it up and smoke it like a big fatty."
5,Excited to have been able to find this candy as have been looking for ages. Was received very quickly and the candy was well packaged and fresh flavor.Will buy again. Thank you.
5,"I've tried a bunch of them and the taste of this product is outstanding.  Even the folks behind the counter at my gym commented on it and they sell a competing product.  Give it a try, you won't be disappointed."
5,"It tastes delisious, and works efectively if yo drink it at the rigth time. Lean body is the suplement with the best flavor I've ever tasted"
5,"Great meal replacement drink that tastes great!  You get plenty of protein and other vital nutrients.  I prepare one of these whenever I'm on the go and I won't have to worry about missing a meal.  The best bang for your buck, especially if you subscribe to the Amazon subscribe and save program."
5,This product is perfect for my Cavalier King Charles Spaniel puppy. His stools are very regular and healthy. My Vet was very pleased to know I picked this product instead of a regular store brand. It's all natural and my puppy loves it. :)
5,"Flour type 00 is better than regular flour.  Whether frying it or baking it, dough maintains softness and pliability.<br />I like it a lot."
5,This is the best flour for home made pizza. It has the best tasting crust I have found. It works best in a super hot oven if you don't have a pizza oven.
1,I thought the whole figs would be softer for spreading but they are not. You have figs laying in a very sweet syrup. I've only tried it on toast one time and it was way to sweet to eat. The figs just lay on top unspreadable. I would not buy again. Save your money.
5,chamomile tea is great with lemons and Apriva. chamomile tea is caffeine free that's great for pregnant women and those with high blood pressure.
5,Love this coffee.  Have bought this flavor and several others in the past.  Recommend it to everyone.  Will continue to buy it as long as I can afford to.<br />The French Vanilla is excellent as well!
5,"These are a great value, great size snack to have, or even share, great snack..... yummy.  Haven't tried other flavors, but just might have to."
4,Reaaaly hot stuff. Way hotter than Dave's Ultimate Insanity. Rivaled only by some of Blair's sauces. I don't think it is 4 million Scoville though..Maybe 1 million.
5,Listen if you want a good taste and hot. This the stuff! It won't melt your eyes out .but it is too hot to take straight . One dab will do ya on a bite of pizza!
3,"it is definatly not 4,000,000. half the heat of daves ghost sauce, maybe weaker. may be a good dipping sauce"
3,HAs a good taste it is a lil hott not 2 bad maybe just a lil less hotter than blaires ultra death sauces but has a better flavor
5,really not much I can say abut this soup mix it taste great to us. we always bought the canned stuff when making pot roasts or whatever. then tried this well we will never go back to canned again. well worth the money will be buying more.
5,These things are seriously beyond delicious!! Just the right touch of saltiness to go with the sweet. A perfect dessert or cheat snack for those long work days :)
5,"Grilled out brats, chicken, and burgers for the entire family yesterday.  Covered all of it with Country Bob's seasoning and all purpose sauce!  The family loved it.  Best sauce available!!  Can't wait to use it on my steaks tonight!"
5,I am very happy with this tea.  I hesitated to order because of price but it comes in a nice tin with 50 round tea bags.  It is great tasting.  I add ginger chips to it and it really is great when I have an upset stomach.  I just recently received my second order.
4,i got it for under 7 dollars shipped...  i wouldnt pay more than eight because your not getting much cereal.
5,I bought two types of edible glitter to decorate a plain cake.  This one was by far the most stunning.  The other silver went on grey (not that appetizing) whereas this one had tonnes of sparkle and really made a statement.  Highly recommended.  Nice fast delivery too.
5,"I need every color that is available ! Love this product! ! Received shipment very fast! Very happy with this product, will buy more."
5,"This stuff worked out great for my Disco Ball Birthday Cake.  My customer loved it! Check it out [...]<br />If you are looking for a great way to add that little extra something for your treats, you found it."
5,I used this product on a cake topper for a wedding cake that I made. It worked out so well. Bride & groom were very happy and got non-stop compliments!!
5,Simply wonderful! It adds that last little bit of WOW to your cake creations. I will be back for more!
5,Totally amazed at how far a small amount of this glitter can be spread. I bought 3 to decorate a wedding cake & used less than 1/2 of one! It was beautiful & worth the money.
5,This was a gift from my Lil Sis.  Awesome.  Great flavor.  Can taste berries and rhubarb.  I love it.  Most likely will order more.
1,"If I could give this food a zero I would. I tried it out and the dogs loved it until they all had the runs for 2 days. It was horrible, smelled bad, and I would never get it again!"
5,"Vimto, love it. Fekkin expensive here though!<br />That's the problem with no longer living back in Blighty, stuff like Vimto becomes much more difficult to get."
3,"Not much of a lemon flavor for lemon cookies, more on the sweet side.  Coconut is listed in the ingredients, but you certainly won't taste it.  My son liked them, so they won't go to waste.  I would not buy them again."
5,"I was born and raised on the east coast  Trenton - New Jersey ). I have loved Tasty-Kakes my whole life , so its a great present to find some mew flavors or twists on old familiar receipes."
4,Shipping was quite a bit but the bottles were all unbroken and in good shape. Since Dublin no longer makes D.P. I wanted some bottles for a keep sake. These meet the bill. Over all good experience.
3,"This is the new ""Dublin"" dr pepper now bottled in Temple Texas.  This is produced after Dr. Pepper force Dublin out of production.  It is not the same as Dublin Dr. Pepper, that is why it is so cheap.  If you want the real thing, you'll pay more for it."
5,"ESPECIALLY AS WE GET OLDER, THE LINING OF OUR STOMACH GETS MORE SENSITIVE TO HARSH CHEMICALS AND SUBSTANCES.  LOW ACID COFFEE IS A COMMON SENSE SUBSTITUTE THAT LOSES NO AROMA OR TASTE IN THE PROCESS.  HIGHLY RECOMMENDED."
3,I received my 2 cases of Rice Works and the chips are awesome tasting and a great price BUT in every single bag (24) the chips were crunched/smashed into little pieces so i guess I have 24 bags of salad toppers or ..... but not chips.
4,"I was delighted to find this product online, because I cannot always find it in the stores.  However, each package I have opened thus far is at least half reduced to crumbs because of poor packaging for shipping.  I doubt that I will order more using this method."
5,I LOVE these chips.  They are addictive...it's hard to just eat a few.  I tried the Chili flavor that has great reviews and I don't think they compare to the Salsa Fresca.  If you like a chip with a little kick...these are perfect.
5,These are great chips.  I have tried both the Salsa Fresca and Sweet Chili and love them both (if I had to choose one over the other would take the Salsa Fresca - just my personal preference).  Will be trying the Sea Salt in the near future.<br /><br />Can't go wrong with these chips!
1,"These things are like eating poker chips with seasoning salt.  They're remarkably high in calories, too!"
5,"Smells great, looks great and tastes great.  As a guy who likes strong espresso type coffee, I was surprised and impressed by the bold flavor with just a hint of Hazelnut.  With just a little half and half its great first thing in the morning."
5,"My husband loves Hazelnut coffee but the price of flavored coffee is so high, I used to only give it to him once a week, but now I can afford to give him his favorite everyday! He loves the rich flavor!"
5,I have been buying this coffee for at least 3 years and I love it. Smooth taste with a hint of hazelnut. Friends enjoy coming over just for a good cup of coffee.
5,"Trying something new with this coffee. Didn't blow me away but for the price, it's excellent. I don't have anything bad to say about it other than it's a BIG bag and I am mildly concerned with freshness toward the end, but we burn thru beans pretty fast =D"
5,This coffee is good. I have tried a lot of hazelnut coffees and this is one of the best I got from amazon. It has a darker and richer flavor than most hazelnut coffee. It was fresh and tasty and the price was great at about $6 per pound with subscribe and save. I will order it again
5,I love this coffee. I tried it in Puerto Rico on our honeymoon and am hooked! I may even go back to Puerto Rico and get more!
5,"This is a hefty roll of mylar! The 50"" width allows more coverage, obviously, but the 1 ml thickness is what's really nice.  It's not flimsy!"
3,"This cake always turns out consistently sweet and moist, but bland.  Compared to the new deluxe Duncan Hines version of German Chocolate cake, this is not impressive.  It will do when you're craving something different from regular chocolate cake, though."
5,This Creme Brulee is as good as any homemade! Why bother with homemade when you can get just as delicious from a box! Easier to make too!
5,Oetker products are always the best. I've used them for years because they have unique items that are tasty and easy to prepare. You absolutly cannot go wrong with this Creme Brulee. Why spend a ton of money at a restaurant when you can serve it by candlelight at home?
5,This Creme Brulee is better than some of the better French restaurants I've been to. I just wish my local grocery stores would carry it!
1,"It tastes like Jack Links brand, not Wild Bill's.  Even the texture is totally different from Wild Bill's.  Not recommended!"
2,"I blame myself for trying to save a buck - this coffee is way too weak for my tastebuds - they say it's a dark blend but it's not even close to a dark roast I buy at stores.  In the end, I have blend each can with a pound of dark roast and it's OK."
3,I bought this along with the regular dark roast at a considerable discounted price.  Well lets just say you get what you pay for.  The flavor really is not there and this as well is not much of a dark roast.
4,We use this coffee at my office. People like it a lot and I feel good about it being organic and fair trade.
5,"Organic, fair trade, Cafe Altura Coffee brews a great pot of coffee. 'Organic' makes it healthy, and 'fair trade' makes it a responsible choice. The Dark Blend is a flavorful choice."
3,"I prefer rich, strong coffee and this product is a bit bland for my taste"
4,"Nice body and full roasted flavor at a reasonable price for a organic ""fair trade"".  I'd buy the discounted pack again, but full price cost it too much to overcome my desire for an affordable coffee."
5,I ordered this for my Mother-in-law who could not find this product anywhere near where she lives.  She is really enjoying this product.
5,Very fresh and tasty SOFT buns that go well with my Omaha steak burger patties.<br />They store well.
5,"very excelent quality preserve lingonberry,,i will order it again,,but the shipment pack should be covered better with strong materials,,thank u for the great felix lingonberry"
5,Have you ever try bbq chicken wings?<br />Use this glase and it would be delicious.<br />I used it a lot but usually bought it in super market. today I didn't find it there so I came online and order more here price is much better here.
5,For some reason they stopped selling this in stores in Fort Worth.  This is my favorite for chicken.
5,I HAD USED AND COME TO LOVE THIS PRODUCT AND SUDDENLY COULD NOT FIND IT IN STORES NEAR ME. I CAME TO AMAZON AND THERE IT WAS! I COULD NOT GET MY CARD OUT QUICK ENOUGH! I SHARE WITH MY DAUGHTER WHO ALSO CAN'T FIND THIS ITEM LOCALLY.<br />THANKS AMAZON!!!!
5,This BBQ Glaze Shake'N'Bake is great for other meats besides chicken and pork.<br />They made great Christmas gifts for grandchildren in college.
5,We live in Tucson AZ and all of a sudden we can't find this one product anywhere in Tucson. I makes the chicken so juicy and tender and the flavor is beyond compare. So happy to be able to purchase some and looking forward to buying more!!!!
5,this item is so hard to find. i was so thrilled to find i could buy more than just one at a time.
5,"I had not been able to find Kraft Shake 'n Bake at the two (2)grocery stores where I shop.I was so glad to find this product available through Amazon.com. It was easy to order and was delivered very quickly. Great service.<br /><br />Thanks,<br />Laura W.<br />Phoenix AZ"
5,For whatever reason the only 2 grocery stores where I live no longer carry this product. It is my husbands absolute favorite. I am so glad I am still able to buy this product on line.
5,at it's best.  I have been drinking this tea since high school and the flavor has not wavered.  I've tried plain chamomile and it didn't make the cut. Nothing beats a cup or two of Sleepy Time before bed as it calms the nerves and settles the tummy.  What a perfect way to drift off into slumber !
5,We make most of our tea from loose leaf in a press pot. Sleepytime is the lone exception. We've been drinking this tea for many years now and it still rates among our very favorites. It's the perfect blend of camomile and mint. And you gotta love the bear.
5,Have used this herbal tea for sometime now...one cup before bedtime and it always helps me rest better.  Love the discount for ordering the six months supply.
5,"when ordering in bulk with the repeat shipping option, this tasty tea is a great value"
5,"Sleepytime tea is one of those teas that can always be counted on. It's very mellow, with a great taste and smell. Perfect for relaxing after a long day. This is the tea that all other herbal teas should be measured against."
5,This product is so great.  My daughter who is extremely pick loves it and she is also gluten free!!  so she can actually have this!!!!!<br />Not bad for 100 calories per serving!!!!!<br />This will be a great dish to take for Thanksgiving dinner.
5,"Easy and delicious!  Have made it in a 9x5"" loaf pan as well as in a mini-muffin pan;  both methods yield a great-tasting product."
5,I make this product when we have any kind of Tex-Mex meal.  Everyone loves it.  It is easy to make and tastes great.
5,"Seems stange that any item this good and tasty would disappear from stock iun the stores.  So glad  to find it on Amazon...and at the rate we eat this - especially in the winter with chili, won't have any problem going thru the bulk order of 12 pkgs...<br />Thank you Amazon and Chi-Chi's!"
5,I had a taco party and almsot every single guest asked me How do I make the Corncake?.  I run out every year.
5,This little packet makes a whole pan full of sweet corn goodness.  Is it a side dish or a dessert or both?  You decide.  Easy to prepare and delicious on the table.
5,"I made the recipe on the package and my family LOVED this dish. I will make it many, many times. My grandson said he wanted a whole dishful just for himself!"
5,sooo happy amazon sells this! the one grocery store that has it in my neighborhood is closing!!!! this is delicious!!! perfect for a fiesta night!
5,Delicious.  Reminds me exactly of the corn cake they use to serve at their restaurants.  I make this with every mexican night we have at home.
5,I too am so glad Amazon sells this!!  I sometimes add a 1/4 cup of sugar when I want it sweeter:)
5,"All the Chi Chi's closed in my area.  I was able to get this mix at the grocery store, but lately it has not been on the shelves. I am so happy to have found it on Amazon.  This mix is awesome.  Great for taco night!!!"
5,"Our daughter was very unhappy because she could not find Chi-Chi's Sweet Corn Cake Mix in her grocery stores.  Thanks to Amazon.com the ""fix"" was easy.  We had Corn Cake while dining on Lake Powell.  Heard the grand kids were enjoying more Chi-Chi's Corn Cake last night.  Thank you!  SR"
2,so so.there was great reviews on product only made it once will try it again
5,"I've been a fan of this stuff for years.  Make sure you stir it up after you pull it out of the microwave since the grease seems to float to the top.  It is quick, easy, and makes for a tasty lunch when you are short on time or don't feel like going out for lunch."
5,Great for a snack (I eat a 2500 calorie/day diet)... I eat this between lunch and work and it hits the spot.  An entire bowl is 400 calories.  Arrived on time and its easier and cheaper than buying in bulk at ACME or other such (not costco but i dont have my own member card)
1,"When the flowers showed up, they were in pretty bad shape.  I figured that water and the provided plant food would spruce them up within a few days.  Didn't happen.  They went from being dull and wilted to being dead within four days of arrival."
5,i received the box of chocolate and was very pleased . the box was in excellent shape and was wrapped well. the candies were fresh and delicious. would get again.
1,"I got this product ship one day express. Unfortunately, when it arrived and I opened it, all I saw was a big blob of melted chocolate with LITTLE macadamia nuts in the center of the holders."
4,"The actual product deserves 5 stars, the reason I gave it 4 stars is because its like three dollars at asianfoodgrocer.com. That's where I order it from, not amazon. Much lower prices."
5,I didn't buy them here but I did buy them from Buford Highway Farmers Market here in Atlanta and they are wonderful. They are worth a try. :)
5,"Great for risotto.  Creates creamy finished product, while maintaining a good 'al dente' bite, better than any other rice I have used."
3,"Very crunchy and salty, just like described. I can also tell they use a lot of artificial  color. Not the best caviar. Might be really good for sushi!"
5,All the dogs on my Christmas list loved this. They ate it right away
5,"These seeds are awesome, good size with the perfect amount of spice.buffalo to ranch flavoring.  I've only been able to find them here locally at 2 or 3 other gas stations, ordering them via Amazon is obviously cheaper and saves me nearly 4-5 dollars buying the box."
5,"These are jumbo and flavored nicely,  I ended up saving $.40 per pack as well, good deal.  Once u go jumbo u never go back."
4,"It was this or a big tub of spice drops. These are better for diabetics. They didn't last long, and my wife enjoys the mess I make 'round the La-Z-Boy."
5,These are the best sunflower seeds ever the bigger size makes them easier to eat. load of flavor in every bag!
5,"The Maxwell House International Coffee - Vanilla Nut Cafe - is absolutely my favorite flavor!  Seems to be extremely difficult to locate now, though.  Last purchase was made through Amazon and hoping it will become available again soon!"
3,"My two cats used to love this formula, but I guess they got tired of it, or maybe the formula was changed ... I only feed it occasionally now."
5,"Excellent Energy drink, I drink one-a-day before I go for my daily walk, gives me a nice boost!  I like the taste, may take a few too get used to it!  No jitters just a boost!"
5,"I started using Celsius over two year ago. Gives just the right boost I needed to exercise in the mornings. No crash or after affects. Has a great taste, nothing strong or overwhelming."
5,"Great oysters, fast shipping. Can't find them local so I took a chance and they were GREAT! They were frozen when I got them and package was well packed."
4,"With Jack Links buying King B, it looks like they have repackaged the original beef jerky strips in this label with the same great results. I hope they keep up with the demand as everyone else finds them as I did.  Thanks for bring them back Jack Links!"
4,"These beef jerky strips are really good.  Texture is just right.  Flavor is peppery, but also just right.  Could be more smoky for me.  This is a repeat buy on my part."
4,"Just like old style jerky.  Whole strips of meat, not compressed chips. Yum Yum. Peppery."
5,let me tell you that this beef jerky has me wanting more. I have never tasted a jerky with more flavor and taste I recommend it to anyone wanting a little more out of their jerky.. A++++++++++++
4,"Over the past two years, thanks to Amazon, I have been sampling jerky from literally all over the U.S. I finally found a tasty, jerky that doesn't give my jawbone a workout. Great meat flavor, an excellent snack."
5,I miss the King B ripple style and the regular jerky too.  Thanks Jack Links for at least offering this.
5,You will love this jerky if you are a beer drinker. Recommend this product for sure for them nights around the campfires!
4,These are great tasting and have good consistency and meatiness.  Easy to eat on the run (no mess).
5,This jerky is the bomb!!! It is by fare the best i have ever had and I have had a lot of jerky in my day.
2,"The product is a good value for the amount you get, however it is way too salty.  The product is very dry and firm.  I think this would be good if they cut the salt content in half."
1,"I'm really disappointed with the changes in quality -- it's not even the same product that we used to love.  A couple of years ago, the product was consistently fantastic, but now the taste, quality of the meat, and freshness are hit or miss...and recently it's all been a miss."
5,"Great flavor, and texture.  It may not be the best jerky out there, but for the price, I couldn't find any better.  It comes in a few different flavors, so there's bound to be one you like.  I just wish the shelf life was longer, I'd love to keep this with the emergency food/water."
5,This is for all the beef jerky lovers out there. If you like jerky this is the best tasting stuff that Ive found anywhere. All of the flavors are great. The black peppered in my opinion is the best and the wood smoked is a little dry but still good. I would recommend it to anybody.
5,These are the best Jerky Strips I have ever tasted. Our family has been eating them for years and they are typically a Christmas delight.
5,"The Smokehouse Jerky is some of the best out there, a perfect quick snack. It has s great smoke flavor and texture. I even started a subscription to get it once a month....save 15% by doing it.<br />The only con would be a little on the salty side. If you like jerky you can't go wrong with this."
5,"A coworker brought this yummyness into the office and I am so greatful.  I am not big beef jerky fan but this stuff totally falls under my ""much yum"" category."
5,This jerky is extremely addictive!  I have had most every other brand of jerky and this is by far the best jerky I have ever had.  It was originally King B Jerky.
2,"I love all different types of beef jerky, but not this one.  It has the flavor of grocery store bought beef jerky once you get over the overwhelming taste of salt. These sticks are cut thin making them tender and easy to chew, but they're just way too salty and definitely not worth $20"
1,"The Jack Link's 30 Jerky Strips were verrrryyyy SKINNY! Some were only about 1/8 inch wide and counted as one strip. If I had known this, I would NOT have ordered the beef jerky strips - tasty, but totally not worth the money!!!!"
2,"too salty -- enough said. I order the wood smoked 30-count jar. Remember, the price is for only ONE JAR (not two)."
3,"Was hoping that the pieces would be a bit flatter in structure, but they shy away from sausage stick territory fine enough.  Flavor wasn't bad, but nothing to write home about.  I'm just glad they weren't that greasy."
2,"this is a good name and a good value; the texture and size of the jerky is fine,<br />but be prepared for the salt. It ruined it for me."
1,Wow. The hickory smoked jerkey sticks were incredibly salty. I could not even eat half of the stick. I have had 3 different people try them and they had the same problem. They are so terrible it tastes like you are dumping salt into your mouth. Avoid these at all costs.
2,I did not realize when I decided to purchase these that they were boxed and because of that I found them stale and hard.  I had previously purchased these at a local store who packaged them in plastic and they were soft and fresh.  Sorry that I could not give these a better review.
5,"This is the only food my cat will eat.  If I buy another variety or brand, it sits in her bowl until it gets stale & I throw it out."
5,I love lemon pepper--I was amazed with this one--large grain and fresh.  Very large jar that delighted me because I use this in nearly everything.  Good tight jar to keep it fresh.  Very inexpensive.  Good buy for home cooks.
1,This says 4 pack...so I assumed like other purchases that I made that it was 4 boxes each with 4 packs. Big mistake! You only get four little pouches. Who would pay over $2 for a little squirt of applesauce? Don't make the same mistake. Buy elsewhere.
5,"This ""squeezy fruit"" as my daughter calls it, is great.  Convenient, yummy, no added sugar...I love it.  I just don't understand why it is so expensive??  I find it at the grocery store for $2 for a four pack.  Don't pay this price, that's crazy!"
5,My cat is so picky! I've tried every brand and flavor and this is my cat's favorite.
5,Just right for making dan dan noodles and other delicious recipes.  Glad to have this in my pantry.  Flavorful vinegar will be useful for various dishes.  Product delivery was great - just as expected.
5,"milder than most vinegars, but with its own very special taste to add to Ume Plum vinegar, and cider vinegar for that hmmmmm layer of flavor!"
5,"This is terrific honey.  What more can one say about it?  There was a great price when I got it, too -- much better than at the local supermarkets."
5,"Delicious, pretty good stuff. Its sweet and not like chewing on leather like some products I've tried. Deffinately worth the money and for people who dont like crazy hot jerky but still like a little bite, this is for you"
5,"This jerky is flavorful and tender..can't ask for much more.  The only problem I have with it, is that it doesn't last long enough around my house ;)"
5,I bought this product because it looked good not knowing if it would taste as good as it looked. Well it finally showed up by USPS well packaged. It's soft smells great and tastes even better. You won't be disappointed. I've already eaten five strips.
5,"This is the absolute and complete BEST beef jerky that I have ever had. You'll be hard pressed to find better, if you can. It's tender and has a good bite but at the same time you won't rip your teeth out either. It's also not too salty."
5,I've been trying different beef jerkeys and by far I find this product to be the best tasting. nice meaty chunks and very flavorful.
5,"SO GOOD SO PERFECT SO TENDER SO MEATY SO TASTY SO DELICIOUS YOU WILL NOT BE ABLE TO EAT JUST ONE, BELIEVE ME I HAVE TRIED. ALL CAPS IS RUDE."
5,"If you like a lot of flavor in each bite, this is it.  A little messy to handle but worth the fuss!!!"
5,it's difficult to describe herbal type pills. with no quick results it takes blind faith really. i reckon these are ok? i got what i ordered quickly
5,This tea is full of flavor without bitterness.  No additions needed.  You will not be disappointed.  Do not try this Earl Grey if you do not like bergamot.
5,"I ordered this for my daughter, who does not like coffee. She says it is the best tasting tea, and it brews perfectly with the Keurig. Also like the large quantity box."
5,"This is the best cat food- I introduced it to my 16yr old cat slowly and she is much healthier, has a shiner coat and sheds less. Each time I purchase, I switch up the flavors, cats love variety.<br />Great product!"
5,"My two Siberian cats refused almost a dozen canned foods, but THIS, they could not get enough of!  Thank you!  A superb supplement to their dry food diet."
5,"Just like anything else from New Zealand this food is amazing. My cat can't wait for it, and plate is always clean. She loves it and I feel great buying Ziwipeak. They even put green muscles in this food. Overall food looks solid, packed with proteins and kiwi love."
1,My cats absolutely would not eat this food so it was a waste of money..it is just sitting in our cabinets.  I will donate it to a shelter...
5,"I have a friend from England who adores fruitcake. For her birthday i sent her a package of fruitcake. She swooned, Fruitcake in June is so decadent. She loves Claxton fruitcake so this was a no brainer. Now I want some too!"
5,"This is amazing chocolate for most baking. Manjari in general is wonderful, fruity and deep in taste. But the feves in the 3 kg package melt super easily, the package is resealable and you can keep it in the fridge."
5,Never gave much thought to this treat until Marshawn Lynch came to town...Awesome have a big ole candy dispenser at work with a big Seahawks sticker on it...Now we have Matt Flynn beast-mode cajun style...
4,"I've always, ALWAYS loved Skittles! They are sweet and chewy, and they will give you plenty of cavities if you're not careful! ^_^<br /><br />Enjoy them, and buy this 3.5 lb bag today!<br /><br />4.5 stars."
3,The package arrived 3 days earlier then it said it would and they were very fresh. They were also cheaper then the candy. Some of the candy had melted together but it was only maybe 3 pieces per bag. Overall really good.
1,"Aweful! They arrived immediately and still were as hard as cement! The bags' supposed re-sealable zipper,didn't re-seal once and maybe the large amount had something to do with it but again, I cannot believe how stale and terrible the candy inside was!"
5,So this bag of skittles is really worth it. Comes with a load of skittles filled too the top of the bag. Skittles is my favorite candy now I order the 3.5lb all the time. Its enough to share and still have a lot left over
5,There isn't much to say other than the delivery was great and the candy was fresh and chewy. Eating alone the bag lasted me 2 months. Great for the price and I'd order again!!!
5,"I ordered these because I couldnt seem to find this size at the store. There were a couple skittle shells at the bottom of the bag from the shipping of the product, but everything else was fine."
1,"... get this type of sugar any other way than through ordering it because the shipping is INSANE!  The sugar is fine but for the price of the shipping, it was not worth it."
5,Ordered this goat cheese and it is just fantastic! I can't digest cow milk so finding these goat cheeses was a great treat! I would order them again they are that delicious! Looks spectacular on a cheese platter with fruit and selected crackers.
5,"This soup is like a combination of vegetable, lentil and Spanish rice soups.  It has a slightly gelid texture, though I never add as much water as I should.  4.5 stars to be exact."
5,Tried this in a turkey burger and it was sooo good. I definitely recommend faery free. Salt can be added or better yet add a sprinkle of Goya Adobo.
5,My kitties love these. Other Goodlife treats are good. Kitties adore these. Beg and plead for them. I think they must be addictive for cats.
5,"Both of our dogs are fed Bil-Jac. My older dog, Dixie, loves this Senior version. It's nutritionally dense, with meat as it's primary ingredient and without empty fillers and fats. Dixie's weight is easier to maintain with this formula, and she has the most marvelous shiny coat too."
2,"The flavor is decent (berry vanilla), but I just can't handle the texture.  It's like a mouthful of sawdust that just disintegrates when you bite into it.  I've been gluten free for about 6 years, and there are much better products out there.  My kids won't even eat these!"
5,"I have to disagree with the other review here! I love the little bits of crunch in these otherwise really soft cookies. I love the banana taste, and I love these cookies! It's so nice to have a a gluten free cookie option that doesn't suck! I totally recommend these!"
5,My daughter who is type 1 diabetic and has Celiac loves these cookies. Have had a hard time finding them in the local health food stores so was so happy to discover them on Amazon so bought 2 cases of them so now there is enough for the whole family.
3,"These are sort of like brownies.  A little soft, a little dry.  My 7 year old really likes them.  They're good if you are on a restricted diet, but otherwise nothing too special."
1,"I purchased these because they do not contain dairy, soy or corn.  Well, in addition to being dairy free, soy free.... they are FLAVOR FREE!  Absolutely horrible dry tasting bars.  First words out of my mouth were ""tastes like dirt"" so that's what I'm going with.  DO NOT WASTE YOUR MONEY."
5,"I crave these day and night. Best cookie/brownie bar I have ever tasted- not too headache-y sweet, but a rich cocoa flavor with a really great texture. They hit the spot. Wish they were at more grocery stores!"
4,I have a 7 yr old w/food allergies and both he and my 3 yr old love these.  I have compared to several other cookie/snack items made with no dairy & eggs and I think we all liked these the best.  Definitely a must have for restricted diets.
5,"I love love love these cookie bars.  I can't have any sugar or any gluten and happened upon these at Whole Foods.  What a saving grace!  The big cookies are also excellent, but I would eat the whole big cookie at one time.  These little bars are perfect."
4,"I have Celiac Disease, and I try to keep the refined sugar to a minimum, and I was suprised by how good these are! The light crunch is a shock at first, but is tasty. It is a tad dry, so I am only giving 4 stars. But the taste is great considering how healthy it is!!"
5,My kids love these and I feel good about giving them to them. They're all natural and sweetened with fruit juice instead of sugar. We like to pop them in the microwave for about 10 seconds - then they taste like fresh out of the oven chocolate chip cookies. Yum.
1,I was disappointed in the unpleasant flavor and dry texture of Nana's Chocolate Munch Cookie Bars. To me there was an odd artificial almost chemical like after taste in them that cocoa powder can't even cover up. I threw away the entire box after tasting the first bar.
5,These cookie bars are great for packing in a lunch or having alone for a snack. Try all the flavors for a variety.
5,"My daughter is very picky, but she like this cookie very much. i haven't seen any product GFCFEFSF this good. great product."
5,"My 3.5 yr old daughter with Autism loves these! She is on a special gluten-free, casein-free and soy-free diet and these are a wonderful snack for her."
5,"My 9 year old daughter has celiac disease, and these are one of her favorite cookies (other than the ones I make!)  They are a great quick snack for her to bring and have on hand so that she DOESN'T feel left out or deprived when cookies are offered to kids in social situations."
5,These are the best!  What a wonderful way to provide a treat for yourself and your kids knowing how healthy and pure they are.  The taste is excellant and satisfies that sweet tooth.  Highly recommend that you try these.
2,tastes like dry brownie w/ invisible pieces of puffed rice which get stuck in your teeth. come on. we can do better than this for cookie bars.
5,very tasty and the perfect size snack.  Reliable in availability and  shipping time.
4,These were good for a snack but found it a little expensive for the size they come in.
5,"Since I cannot eat sugar, and there are so few healthy options out there, this is perfect for my chocolate fix!"
2,THis product is definitely not as good as some other gluten free cookies!  Try Pamela's!
5,we have a two and four-year-old and they enjoy these cookies.<br />Good tasting<br />very convenient packaging ( individually wrapped)  Great for stuffing in glove compartment for emergencies.<br /><br />the right size for our kids<br />No bad stuff<br />no complaints.
5,"they are fabulous and not bad for you, what else could you ask for!"
5,They taste great and are healthy. We keep our home stocked with Nana's Cookie Bars.
1,be careful...even though this is listed under gluten free section it is NOT gluten free
5,The most awesome cookies on the planet. We need a treat that is not full of sugar and Nanas fits the bill for us.
2,I was a bit disappointed in these.  They crumble very easily and have an unusual texture.  My son (6) does not like them.
1,"I don't think I've ever eaten anything drier than these cookie bars, ever in my life. They taste okay, but I just can't choke them down, even with coffee."
2,This device's lid does not seal.  I am not sure why it is being sold as anything other than a trashcan.  Did work well for beer as long as it was transferred to a secondary right at the end of fermentation.
5,"I used to buy this product at the local WalMart, but they no longer carry it.  It delivers more garlic flavor per ounce than ordinary garlic powder, and I use it whenever fresh garlic is not practical...on my burgers, in potato salad, etc."
5,The garlic granules make cooking with the garlic flavor without adding extra salt.  The Tones quality is exceptional.  Arrived quickly
5,"My baby loves this. It's a great first food to start with when teaching your baby to have solids. The pouch makes it easy to get the product out, without making a mess and the lid is easy to refasten, so you can use it again over a few feeds."
5,"I'm usually a caffeine guy, but I had to switch to decaf while my wife is pregnant.  This is definitely the best decaf out there - full flavored, smooth, and very aromatic.  It's the best!"
3,I love Community Coffee but the batch I received of the Special Decaf was old the bags had lost their vacuum packed state.
5,I got this product a while back. It was very delicious. I love trying to cook Korean food. I would recommend this product for those who are people new to cooking Korean food. The hot pepper paste came in perfect condition.
5,I love all of Joray's flavors. Watermelon is my favorite! Joray's fruit rolls are more natural than other fruit snacks.
5,"These are delicious.  They have the same consistency as a Spree or Runt, and they are sour all the way through.  I'm sure I'll be ordering some more."
5,My wife uses this coffee in our espresso machine to make cappuchinos with cocoa powder and it is great.  She says it has a nice strong coffee flavor but smooth not bitter.  I don't drink coffee but I took some to work for the drip machine there and several of the coffee drinkers love it.
5,I put all my dogs on this food about a month and a half ago. I began to notice my older/overweight dog become more playful and energetic. He has already lost some weight. Also all of the others have more solid stools and they actually enjoy eating this. I would recommend this to everyone.
5,"These are very good. They are very close to home made, but when I'm in a hurry, I really appreciate having them at hand."
5,I was amazed at the actual taste of this product . . . the amount of protein and the lack of fat is really good.  They have a lot more flavors and all of the combinations are really good.
5,"Great tea...I have checked other stores ie: Target, Kohls and they are more than this tea costs plus the boxes you get on Amazon are bigger quanities."
5,"the best, tastiest and fast making ice tea by the glass, does not leave an after taste, like a delicate summer breeze in a glass, fresh ice tea anytime of day or night, great for company"
5,"I prefer to sweeten my own tea and so this is perfect. It makes a strong cup of iced tea, and some may choose to add more water after brewing. Easy to make and great to have around. Taste is very good."
5,I love my keurig and especially like to fix my iced tea with these kcups. They are very flavorful  and every glass is fresh brewed!  I drink iced tea all year so I a glad I found an affordable optuIon!
1,Disappointed.  The big boxes had a very different flavor than the smaller boxes.  I am not sure why but not good.
5,I ordeed this product because this tea is really good. The shipment came as expected. I love the taste of this tea. It's not stong at all.
5,"I adore these K-Cups! On a keto diet, it can be hard to find pre-made drinks that aren't loaded with sugar. With these guys, I can control the sugar content but still enjoy that perfect glass of iced tea."
1,"We recently purchased the K-Cup machine and I was quite excited as I drink iced tea rather than coffee. This blend of black tea is quite bitter and not at all what I was looking for. It works as advertised, just not the right tea for me."
5,"My dog has many food allergies, but these made-in-the-USA treats are free of wheat, corn, egg, and dairy.  My dog can't get enough of them."
5,"My dogs love these !!  When I ran out of them recently, they were ""counter"" sniffing trying to find some.  I have a service dog that has to maintain his weight, and these are perfect for him."
5,These are great treats!  My dog is older and has a few extra pounds so I decided to buy these for her.  She loves them.  Also keeps her occupied for some time while she is eating it.
5,My dogs loves them. Glad to know that I have found a snack that is appealing to my dog but also something that won't have him breaking the scales!
5,My dog really enjoys these treats and the plus is that they help keep his teeth clean too. Will definatly purchase these again.
5,"I just got these and my dogs love them, they smell pretty good and their breath is a little better smelling. They are excited when i open the treat jar and they see these yummy treats. I like them for the low calorie and better breath~"
2,"Not a big fan.  Will not buy this again.  plus she eats it really quick too, other than the throw up part."
1,the product was hard as a rock. i could not even break it in half. both dogs had hard time chewing them. puppy could not either will not get product again. unless the two packages i got were old and dried out.
5,These Dental Sticks are perfect for my two dogs that have food allergies and they LOVE them and i like the price for them here at Amazon.
5,"My dog absolutely loves these!  I try to give one to him everyday, either in the morning or before we go to bed at night.  It doesn't take him long to finish it off... but long enough to put dishes away or brush my teeth.  :)"
4,"My dogs are very tiny and I needed a chew that would have the benefits of teeth cleaning but without any weight gain, and these did great, plus my dogs enjoyed them. If a dog doesn't like the taste and won't chew on a dental stick, then it would defeat the purpose. So these fit the bill all around."
1,We have a year old pug who will eat just about anything but these!  Unfortunately he just would not go near them no matter how hard we tried to peak his interest.
3,THESE TREATS ARE MORE FOR A LARGER DOG AS THEY ARE VERY HARD AND THICK.  THE GIRLS (my maltese) LIKE THEM EXCEPT WAY TOO BIG AND HARD TO CHEW FOR THEM..
5,When I'm riding and hit the wall where my legs are just out of gas (glycogen) I can eat a pack of these chews and within minutes feel relief and renewed energy!  I never go on a ride without them.  oh yeah...they taste pretty good too.
5,"Great seller. The product was as described.  The seller shipped the product quickly.  Good, fair price. Honey Stingers are by far the best training/race day nutrition you can buy.  They taste great, easy on the stomach, and organic.  I love them."
5,These energy chews are absolutely delicious! They hold up really well in your pocket or backpack when you're backpacking or mountain biking! I really couldn't imagine eating any other energy chew ever again!
5,They taste so good. Easy on my stomach when I am running. Help keep my energy up on long runs. LOVE THEM!!!
5,These taste good - kind of like cherry koolaid. 95% organic ingredients make it a bit healthier than koolaid. Better than the Clif Bloks (I say that b/c the cola Clif Bloks have a medicinal after taste).
5,"I love these things.  Unlike other products, this actually tastes really good.  I would recommend this to my family and friends."
5,"A great pick-me-up when exerting energy. I eat these while biking. Honey base is apparent in the after-taste, but isn't over-powering. The chews are great-tasting and provide energy without caffeine."
5,"My kids love these!  They have a great flavor and, for us, are preferred over Sharkies.  My daughter sometimes gets stomach aches from fruit snacks, but has had no trouble with these."
5,We do a lot of bicycle riding in the heat and longer rides as well. We don't want to crash from lack of carbs in our system. Other energy products don't taste as good as these do. They are conveniently packed in little pouches so they are easy to grab and take along when we ride. Good stuff!
5,"I ordered these to use for marathon training. I have a sensitive stomach,but have had no problems with these. They do give me energy during those long runs!"
5,These organic energy bites are delicious and work great.  I use them for golf tournaments or long bike rides.  A few bites every half hour and you will have ample energy for hours of activity.
5,I tasted a few of these and they are pretty good.  I was expecting something a bit flavorless and I can imagine happily snacking on these for a multi-day packing hike.  I will write more after I have taken them on the trail.
5,"Tried the pink lemonade flavor today during my long run...unbelievably awesome. Tasted great, no stomach issues, no sticking to my teeth, water not required to ""wash it down"" and most importantly - it was the best run I've had in a long time. Can't wait to try other flavors."
5,Stingers are better tasting and more convenient than gels and work just as well to provide energy when exercising over long periods of time.
5,"These energy chews have a great flavor, will give you good energy before or during a workout, and are a reasonable price. I would recommend this to any endurance athlete such as a cyclist, runner, triathlete, etc. Strength Training and Sports Nutrition for Cycling"
5,I use Honey Stinger Energy chews on all my long distance bike rides.  I ride over 100 miles a week and love all the different flavors.
5,"Yo soy corredora, y he probado muchos tipos de productos, este es el que mejor resultado me ha dado."
4,If you have been out to Philmont on a treck or as staff these are given to you in your trail meal. They are organic and made of honey. They good and healthy. A+
4,"This tastes great and I like that it's more natural than most other sodas available. Basically, it's a carbonated juice.  I generally prefer a larger 12 oz. size though."
5,"It is so hard to find a nice juice drink that is either too sugary or, even worse, has additives like artificial sweeteners. The Switch Orange Tangerine delivers on flavor. If you like juice and want a full-flavored orangy-carbonated fizzy drink, this one fits the bill. Very good!"
5,Refreshing and light.  A little on the sweet side but not overly sweet.  I enjoyed the orange flavor!
3,"I split this can with my spouse.  I would have given it 2 stars, he gave it 3.  Nice idea, 100% carbonated juice, but the taste is pretty mild.  Not really what I would call refreshing.  Good idea, though, I would try it in other flavors."
4,Perfect size can and a refreshing drink. I think it's proof that simple is best. This would be my first choice for a drink if I were out and about.
5,"This drink is a nice blend of juices (mostly orange) and carbonated water.  There are no other ingredients.  It has a decent amount of natural sugars from the juice, so it is not a low-calorie drink.  I thought the balance of flavors and sweetness was quite nice and would definitely buy again."
5,"This product is like orange juice that is fizzy. It reminds me of another product, Izze , but this product is slightly sweeter and isn't as carbonated as Izze. I would recommend this product, just make sure it is cold because it tasted alot better cold than warm."
5,"I put my Orange Switch in the refrigerator overnight to make it nice and cold, and I had it with breakfast.  I love the taste of it - mostly orange, with a hint of carbonation.  It tastes sweet naturally and I'm sure it's good for you.  I would buy this product  :-)"
3,"This was a weird drink - I had high expectations, but the flavor was just odd - it really did taste like fizzy Tang drink mix.  However, my kids really liked it, and I think it is a great alternative to junky soda, so I will most likely buy more - but not for ME to drink.  ;)"
1,It is a good thing the can is so small. The product is several cuts below Sunny Delight. Terrible!
3,It may be all natural but it didn't have a natural taste to me.  The can size is small and the calories were more than I thought there should be.  I like the mild carbonation ok but I wouldn't switch from orange juice.
5,This is a very refreshing carbonated juice drink with no aftertaste.  I love the flavor and the fact that there is no added sugar.  It's more subtle than orange so really kills a thirst.  The size is perfect for times when you don't really want a 12 ounce drink.
5,"Very nice drink.  I enjoyed it, especially when it was chilled.  The flavor is powerful but not overpowering.  I loved the bubbles.  Great drink."
4,This drink is very good especially after a long hot workout. It quenches the thirst without all the added sugars and preservatives. I highly recommend.
1,"This product taste like an orange juice, an artificial one but with less sugar and less flavor I didn't like it."
4,"This has great flavor, but I am not sure it would be a soda alternate.  I am thinking it would be good for a lunch or mini fridge at work!  Tastes great, but I really did not get the carbonation kick I get from a soda."
5,This stuff taste just like flavored carbonated water.<br />In this case Flavored with orange and tangerine.<br />I imagine it's better for you than plain soda.<br />I really found it tasty. It has a strong citrus flavor<br />that I preferred to some of the other flavors.
3,"I don't like how so many bottled and canned drinks these days (even the low-calorie ones) are so sweet.  This was nicely not-too-sweet, but had a canned, not fresh juice flavor.  It is personal taste, but I didn't care for the 'processed' flavor."
5,Our family is a huge fan of IZZE and this was right in line with that. The flavor was not too sweet and refreshing. My favorite way to enjoy this was with some ice and vodka...obviously that's only for those of you reading this that are 21 yrs or older!
5,"I also got the Cherry one and this is just as good.  It's a break from soda or water or coffee.  I really liked the light refreshing taste and it doesn't fill you up like sodas can.  It's very very tasty and it had a very fresh orange taste, not artificial tasting.  I really liked it."
4,"We are big Izzie fans, but we were excited to try this sode. We were VERY pleasantly pleased. It is a very orange taste, delicious and it feels good to know there is absolutely NO sugar. So, when our children want a soda we serve this and they are delighted. It's a win/win!"
4,"I repeat, carbonated fruit drinks can be too sugary. This drink reminds me of other orange soda brands without the extra sugar that combined with the metallic can always leaves an odd taste in my mouth. Orangina has a bit more flavor, but Switch Tangerine Orange is light and refreshing,."
4,"No harsh after taste, no tangible negatives.  It just doesn't have the ""bite"" that I crave from other carbonated beverages like ginger ale or root beer.  It's a good option for a healthful drink with some fizz."
5,"I think sodas are a big waste of money.  That said, I had the opportunity to try this and it is DIVINE!!!"
4,"I thought the drink was delicious, but too sweet. I mixed it half n half with sugar-free ginger ale and loved it, however, I rarely drink sugared drinks. You need to make a sugar-free version."
5,This drink has a wonderful orange citrus flavor.  It is robust but not too strong.  A great natural alternative to soda.  My 13 year old likes it as well.  Would not hesitate to purchase.
1,"I could not finish this drink, it is like drinking orange syrup. It may not have any added sugar in it but one can of 8.3 ounces has 34 sugar grams and 36 carbs. I'll stick to water when I want to quench my thirst!"
5,"Yes, you should order this drink because it does taste great.  (As long as price is no object)<br />Tastes like orange juice with seltzer water.<br />But dont feel guilty about drinking it because it is 100% juice !"
5,"I usually cringe a little before I do a natural juice/carbonated beverage.  There is frequently something of an aftertaste that is unpleasant.<br /><br />This is refreshing, light, very bubbly and leaves a bright taste after with no cringe effects.<br /><br />I definitely would buy this drink."
4,"The can size is like a Redbull drink's.  However, its sugar content is 34 grams.  Attached is a photo of the nutrional facts.<br /><br />In terms of its taste, in my opinion, it's quite tasty, sweet, a bit tangy and very orangish!"
3,"<span class=""tiny""> Length:: 2:47 Mins<br /><br /></span>Short video review with first open, pour and taste of The Switch Orange Tangerine."
4,"If you want a quick pick me up that is not full of added sugar, then this is a refreshing alternative to a soda. The flavor is more heavily tangerine (which only makes sense). It isn't overly sweet, which is a good thing."
3,"If you like a little fizz with your juice this is a good product.  Tasty and refreshing.  However, like all juice it is not low in calories, so don't buy it expecting it to be more like a low cal fruit flavored sport drink."
2,"This tastes like carbonated orange juice, very tart.  It is very expensive compared to easier-to-find similar beverages.  If one had allergies or health issues, it might be worth drinking."
3,"This orange soda is clearly more healthful, and it tastes tangier, although somewhat less sweet, than other orange sodas.  The one big drawback for me was that this drink lacks caffeine."
4,"This was a very interesting drink! It was refreshing, tasty and healthy! It was very Tangerine tasting, no after taste and very refreshing!"
5,"This is a wonderful alternative to soda pop.  It's delicious, refreshing and most of all, natural.  I ordered the Tangerine/Orange.  I'm anxious to try the other flavors.  My only gripe is that the cans are rather small.  Other than that, it rocks!!"
5,"So, I sampled this SWITCH Orange/ Tangerine Blend. Low on the Carbonation, high on the Orange taste, and worth every sip in Gold! Plus, healthy to boot...Give it a try, and you may discard those ""Brand Names"" once and for all!"
5,"This can of juice was delicious.  It reminded me of the Orangina beverage.  I did find it strange that they chose to package this product in a can normally associated with ""Energy Drinks"" like Red Bull since they market it as ""All Natural"".  Nevertheless, it's yummy and I recommend it!"
5,"The Switch Orange-Tangerine beverage is a mix of orange and tangerine juices with carbonated water, and, I must say, it tastes AMAZING!!!!!!!!!!!!!! It's similar to soda, but without all the unhealthy artificial ingredients and high-fructose corn syrup. If you find it, buy it!!!!!!!!!!"
5,Very Natural flavor. Not loaded with sugars and other things not good for you. Has a fresh taste of orange/tangerine and the carbonation is great. Great taste. I enjoyed this product and would recommend.
3,"According to the side of the can, it's 100% juice with a balance on the carbonation. It tastes great if not for the chalky aftertaste. The low carbonation made it feel less of a soda and more of a juice. I probably wouldn't buy it in the store because of the weird taste."
1,"I have a big sweet tooth and thought I would really like this, but it was too sweet even for me. I even tried adding water, but that didn't help. I haven't tried any of the other flavors, so I can't comment on the brand in general, but I'll never try this flavor again."
2,"If you think this is going to be a healthy product, you are sadly mistaken. It still contains 36g of sugar per can!  If you want to end up a fat diabetic, by all means, try it. Otherwise, try the ZERO CALORIE, ZERO SUGAR, ZERO CHEMICAL naturally fruit flavored seltzers like those by La Croix."
1,"These are definitely not worth close to a dollar a piece.  If they were at my local grocery, I might give twenty to thirty cents per can for them.  I didn't really like the flavor that well, but if you did, they might even worth up to fifty cents per can.  Otherwise, pass these up."
4,"A good drink, about 3 WW points. I mean it's about what you'd expect from an orange soda- expect it's all natural, so you recognize the things on the ingredient label.<br /><br />Downside- really a lot of calories for such a small can!"
3,"The logo on the can states ""0% of what you don't want..."" but that's not quite true. It's quite tasty, but loaded with calories.<br /><br />Next time, they need to leave out the sugar as well.<br /><br />Also, this drink isn't readily available."
5,"I am very fond of citrus drinks to begin with, so maybe I am biased.<br /><br />But what I liked most about this was it wasn't too sweet and it is all natural.  And it has a real citrus taste not a fabricated one.<br /><br />Love it."
5,"I was pleased to discover that Switch Orange Tangerine is actually quite tasty.  More please to find out that it contains no sugar, corn syrup or artificial flavors.  What it does have is several healthy ingredients.  I highly recommend it."
4,"Very refreshing!  Ingredients are 3 different fruit juices, sparkling water, and no sugar!  About 150 calories per can, and they're smaller than regular soda cans.  So the ingredients are pretty natural, but 150 calories might be too much for some people!"
4,Expecting something like Fanta or Sunkist I was surprised how smooth and subtle Switch is. Definitely a good combination of refreshment and flavor. Love the fact that it doesn't tast too carbonated.
4,"The taste says fresh-squeezed quality fruit. The carbonation content is lower than some drinks of this variety. This ratio makes for a heavier juice drink. Though a delicious treat, especially with breakfast on the deck, I prefer to save a few calories (140 per can) and have more carbonation."
4,This tangerine soda reminds me a lot of the drink called orangina but with a pronounced tangerine flavor.<br /> It is basically an all natural carbonated juice. It is very refreshing and pleasant tasting. Over all I like it a lot.
5,"Four people in my family tasted this orange tangerine drink.  It tasted good to all four people, and agreement from all four is difficult.  It does not taste like a soft drink, but much better.  If you are looking for a fiz that is tart, this is your drink."
3,This product has a nice smooth taste with the additional tanginess of tangerine.<br />It also has a little bit of a sweetness to it but syrupy sweet.<br />Not lingering or noticeable aftertaste.
5,"This is a very tasty and refreshing little drink.  One of the best orange drinks you will find anywhere.  I only wish it were bigger, because it's that good."
2,"8.3 ounces and a tad expensive is what I'd say about this drink.34 grams of sugar is also a negative for me. I'm not a sugar lover. All in all not big enough to quench my thirst,and not delicious enough to find me coming back for more.Natural but not that intensely citrus."
1,I tried this along with two of my children and we all agreed that it tastes like spoiled OJ but fizzier. Maybe it would be an acquired taste but I won't  be drinking it again to find out.<br /><br />Oddly enough the black cherry version is quite good.
5,"Pop the can and get sensory caress from the orange scent.<br />The taste is pure citrus bliss. Great flavor. I'd say the flavor is halfway between fresh orange juice and really good orange soda. The tangerine is definitely present, but mostly only as a very pleasent after taste.<br /><br />Love it."
5,Good things come in small packages!! This is an excellent non-soda thirst quencher. No sugar but an outstanding taste!!
3,"How can tang be lugubrious?  If you made it a bit watered down, a bit more aftertasty, a bit less child-friendly.  It's an all right soda, but I don't feel the thrill of drinking it that I did drinking tang as a child.  I can't pretend I'm an astronaut with this.  Sometimes, advertising just helps."
3,"Taste like tang, only more expensive.  I'm not a fan of tang.  If you love tang and want some convenience, this just might be the drink for you."
3,"Sadly, I was supposed to receive this product, but never did.  I imagine it's good given the others I've tried, but alas, that won't happen.  Still, I have to write a review, so there you go."
2,"The carbonation in this drink was way too much. So much in fact, that it over powered the flavor. (Orange-tangerine is usually very good together).  I expect this from a soda, but not a ""healthy"" drink. Lose some of that club soda bite and you have one delicious drink. Until then, I'll pass."
4,Switch is a GREAT alternative to sodas for our family! Love them and I don't feel bad about the kids drinking them.  Great variety of flavors! I just wish they were more easily found in stores.
5,"We really have to limit additives and sugar for our son with Autism. Switch Orange Tangerine really fills the bill. He feels like he's getting ""real"" fizzy soda, and mommy is happy it's not loaded with chemicals and additives and actually has real juice in it. A total win-win."
3,"If you like your drink not so smooth and a bit ""tangy""...this should work for you ....but... alas! ... not for  me.."
5,Switch is a fantastic replacement for sodas. You still enjoy having the carbonation but with fruit juice. It is very satisfying.
4,Seriously a great orange drink on par with Orangina without being super crazy sweet.  I have purchased this frequently since my first taste of it through the Vine program. Also! Goes great with vodka or tequila!
4,Its nice to have a 'treat' to give my kids that they feel like they are getting soda---they love the taste and I don't feel like I'm having to compromise any quality .....<br />I don't enjoy soda but I do enjoy this product and occasionally will grab a can--great product at a good price!
4,"This is the only flavor of switch I have tried.  It tastes just fine and is not overly sweet.  The carbonation is nice.  More importantly though, this makes a FANTASTIC mixer to use with vodka."
4,I have tried a couple different flavors of this soda and found it to be pretty good.Its lighter than regular soda.
3,"It's not bad. Good ingredients for a change so that's a plus. Taste is okay but not great. I would drink it if offered, but doubt I'd buy it."
4,"This is a nice, refreshing carbonated drink. It has no added sugar, as advertised. But its name is a bit misleading. The ""Orange Tangerine"" also has some apple and grape juice added. The grape is not a great addition to the blend, so I wasn't thrilled with the flavor."
5,"Hands down my all time favorite iced tea. I typically prefer loose tea, but the taste of this tea is wonderful!  The pouches are so easy to use and make clean up a breeze."
5,"This tea is to die for.  It hits the spot.  Easy to make ice tea.  All of my friends love it as well.  I am delighted to serve it.  I look forward to drinking it, it is my new favorite drink!"
5,"We go through a lot of dressing and my husband HAS to have this brand only, so I saw this and said GREAT!"
1,"I like the taste of this dressing, but realized that it contains the additive mono sodium gluconate. This chemical gives me migraines, which is very difficult to tolerate. I am sorry to say that I will no longer purchase this dressing unless they remove this flavor enhancer."
5,"The cups to make my own coffee K-cups work fine.  If there had been free shipping it would have been better, but I will order again and look for a way to not pay 1/2 the price of the product just for shipping."
4,Much better than having to fight removing coffee grinds from a metal basket. I love being able to just toss grinds into the trash.
4,These little cups are a perfect compliment to our k-cup varieties!  We use them for our coffees and loose teas.  I was not disappointed and they are much easier to use than the reuseable cups sold by Keurig....
5,"I am giving this as a gift to go along with a single coffee brewer.  Though ratings say there are problems, saving money on easy to purchase coffee is better.  We live in the sticks in Wisconsin."
5,This was a great buy for the money and a hard product to find.  I was pleased when I received it doing it this way I cut my coffee costs down by 2/3rd even after you consider the price of the product I am very happy
5,These were on backorder for a long time but well worth the wait. I can finally use the coffee beans I've had for awhile and have a great cup of coffee with no grounds. I totally love the product and will definately order more in the future. Would like to see them in 100 count.
3,work OK. main problem they leak out the top a bit as well as inside the machine.  is it worth the extra work?  it is if you want to pay a fraction of the cos of a k-cup.  plus you can use any coffee you desire.
4,These coffee holders are much easier to use than the others I have used and make life a little easier!
4,Nice product.  Good company.  Only complaint is that it took over a month for them to ship it after I ordered and they never let me know what was going on.
5,These worked great for us.  We are able to reuse the plastic parts a couple of times before discarding them.  We love being able to use our favorite coffee.
5,The DisposaKups are so easy and convenient to use.  They are a great substitute when I run out of K-Cups and don't want to run to the store to buy a replacement supply and pay higher in-store prices.
5,"shipped in great shape.  I gave these to my son, he is the one who uses reg coffee and he really likes these disposable k-cups.  I guess I will still have to send him coffee beans every mo."
5,"I love coffee that I buy locally and this product allows me to use it in my Keurig brewer.  Getting the lid on is a little challenging, but the end result is worth it.  This is the coolest find of mine this year!!"
5,"Great product - brought it for a gift and will be buying some more for me.  User friendly product, easy to use and works with any kcup machine"
5,I love the cups - I have reviewed this before and said the same thing.  Saving a lot of money using these kups.
5,"This product is exactly as described.  I use my Keurig Brewer daily and now I am able to use my choice of coffee.  They are simple to use and work great.  The delivery from LiquiBuy, LLC on Amazon was prompt and packaged perfectly."
5,This is the second time I've ordered this product and I plan to order these often.  They work perfectly and I am able to use my favorite speciality coffees especially when I run out of the prefilled K-cups sold at retail stores.
4,"These DisposaKups are ""the cats meow"" they serve the purpose thy were intended for very well and were delivered as promised on time and well packaged arrived in good condition I would recommend to all friends."
5,"What a pleasure it is to be able to use my own coffee, even make cups up to take to work with me!  These are easy, mess free alternatives to the apparatus I bought to use with my machine, there are no coffee grounds in my sink now!"
5,I received and have been using my DisposaKups for several days.  I highly recomend this product.  I fill up a dozen or so at a time and just pop them into the Coffee maker when I want a fresh cup of coffee.  The coffee comes out fresh and with no coffee grounds in the cup.  Who could ask for more?
5,"They are just the right size, the filter works fine and so does the lid.<br />They're easy to fill and store for future use.<br />Since its ""all-in-one"" and disposable like the pre-filled Keurig cups, its a good way to enjoy my favorite brand of coffee."
5,"Got product on time - early in fact,  Great Experience!  I would order from them again!  Very good place to buy these from."
5,Easy to use and saves money. Gives you control on the strength of your coffee. I will purchase them again.
4,"Love the product! I can now custom blend my personal favorite coffee blends, and get them CHEAPER than buying pre-fab K-cups!"
5,"The seller was prompt to ship, I receive the disposable K-cup in two days. When I receive them, I try one of the disposable K-cup on Keig, the ease of use and the quality of the cup it made and the saving from pre-fill K-cup coffee brands is worth the price."
5,I love these disposable K-Cups as I prefer to use my own brand(s).  These accomplish the job perfectly and so easy to use.  Thankyou for this product.  Seller was prompt in shipping.  Good packaging.  I will purchase again.  A++++
5,I ordered the DisposaKups because I have several coffees in bags that I had left over and wanted to use.  The cups work great.  I quickly figured out that the filter must be pushed down in order for the lid to fit. Easy to load and easy to dispose.
2,"Caused my cuisinart k-cup brewer to leak every time I used it.  Great idea, just needs some adjustments so that the coffee maker works properly with it."
5,This product saves me money since I can use a regular brand that i like in these kcups and I can still have the kcup convenience of making one drink at a time without using nasty instant coffee.  Great product!
5,I really enjoy this disposable. The only thing that would make it better would be for the cups and lids to be made out of a more eco friendly material. Coffee tastes great.
5,"When I used the k-cup filter that came w/keurig, I didn't like the taste of any coffee I used so I stopped using it altogether.  However, when I saw DisposaKups on Amazon, I had my doubts but took a chance...They worked great.  Plan to keep them in stock."
5,"I love these DisposaKups. They allow me to use some of my favorite canned or fresh bean coffee in my Keurig coffee maker. There is no mess, easy as using the regular K kups, just throw away when you are done making your coffee. LOVE the convenience. I have just place a 2nd order."
4,Great product to tide me over with my supply of Starbucks til they start making k-cups.  Easy to assembl and use with my own ground coffee.
5,"Great product, enables you to use your own coffee in your single brew maker. And I can make up several at a time!!!"
3,"I like the DisposaKups.  If I'm fixing more than one cup, it's quicker to use the DisposaKups than it is to clean out the refillable holder, which came with my machine."
5,I was getting tired from washing out the little refillable baskets to make a second cup. The solutions are to get multiple baskets or the disposable type. The filtering is a little better and the coffee has fewer solids. It is easy to use and does what it says.
5,"Tried the  disposable k-cups and they work great, just as good as keurig k-cups. Put my own mid grind coffee in cups and they worked without problems. They couldn't be any easier to use. Will continue to use them."
3,"Product is, as advertised, a good way to utilize your own coffee blends.  It is easy to fill and prepare for use, however, it sometime leaks at the end of the brewing process."
5,"Like the DisposaKup lids, the DisposaKup set is just as good if not better. If you tossed your previous Keurig Kcups, this set will take care of you. I will definitely be purchasing them again."
5,I love DisposaKups and I'm so glad that Liquibuy provides them to consumers.<br />DisposaKups are fantastic and the vendor does a very good job communicating with its customers.
5,"I have lots of ground coffee and since having my Keurig have not been able to use it.  But, with the disposable cups, I can use up all my ground coffee and get the tastes I want.  I would buy again; convenient.  (Be sure you snap the lid on securely because it is a tight fit.)"
5,My wife just loves these cups.  First off I have to say they arrived a month earlier than stated.  Excellent!  The convenience of being able to use your own coffee and throw away the little cups afterwards is fantastic.  No clean-up.  Excellent.
3,It is difficult to judge the amount and grind of coffee to put in the K-cups. If it is too fine a grind or is too packed full it only give you a half of a cup.
5,"I found these cups to be easy to use, and a lovely way to make pods of your own favorite coffee."
4,Thank God they finially made them I can't always afford the buy the regular k-cups. The only change I would make is to have peel and stick top for them. The peel and sticks could have your own name on them so you could share them with your friends. Ron
5,"We have the K-cup, however, these disposable K-cups are the best ever. I am always rushed in the morning and cleaning out the old K-cup to make another cup of coffee to put in the togo cup, is NOT what I want to do...<br /><br />I'm so grateful to have found this product!!!"
5,This is a great product and would highly recommend to all Keurig fans. You can make your own k cups at a fraction of the cost.
5,this filters are perfect to use with the extra ground coffee I have.they are as good or better than the K-Cups.
5,I really liked the premise of the product so I ordered.  They are not easy to store and therefore assemble for use.  But this overcomes the usefulness of the product.
5,"DisposaKups - Disposable K-Cups for Keurig Brewers - 50 Cups, Lids, Filters - 100% Disposable are handy because you buy your own coffee that you like and just fill K-cups and then throw them out.  I pre-fill them so all I have to do is put them in the machine."
4,"These things work very well.  The only trouble I've had with them is if you leave one in the machine overnight, it sticks and is hard to get out.  Otherwise, a great product!!!"
1,THE LIDS DO NOT FIT. COFFEE RUNS OUT OF THE POD. A TOTAL WASTE OF MONEY. THERE ARE OTHER FILTERS ON THE MARKET THAT ARE MUCH BETTER.
5,"FINALLY, a cheaper alternative to buying K-cups, & I can use all of the half-full bags of coffee in my cupboard from my pre-Keurig days! Works perfectly for both of my Keurig machines!"
1,"The products lid stays attached to the needle on the Keurig, allowing coffee grounds to fall everywhere. Very messy. If this didn't happen, it would work well."
1,These cups were difficult to cap (putting the lids on securely was a comedy show) and they created a mess when used in the Keurig; the water went everywhere.  Add together PIA and MESS with an end outcome of weak cup o' Joe = I'm not a very happy buyer.
1,The lids are impossible to secure.  This purchase was a complete waste of money.  Product cannot be used as lids are unable to be secured.
5,My daughter lives in Hawaii and sent me some great coffee from there. I have a Keurig and  was not sure how to use the new coffee. I got these fast fast and now am using my Hawaiian coffee. Great product.
1,I ordered the disposa kups with the thought of making my own kups. They don't fit together without a big production. The lids won't fit and water comes out the top of the brewer lid as well as the kcup. Just a big mess. not what I wanted at all. want to return them and get a refund. Donna Phillips
3,This is what is needed to use with finely ground coffees. It works well. With none fine ground coffee I prefer using my Solo Fill Cups they are easier to use. I have had six for some time and have had no problem except when using fine ground coffee.
1,"The units go together easily, but no matter how much or little coffee I put in the filter, it caused overflow. It's as if the filters are too thick. I also had a few cups that didn't pierce correctly.  Definitely not worth the money for these!"
1,"These little cups are a waste of money. The Kerug machine had a difficult time processing the coffee through the cup, and as a result I ended up with several half cups of coffee.<br /><br />I tried it about 10 times, and then gave up."
5,I ordered 100 DisposaKups.  They came fast and were just what was advertised.  I will definitely be re-ordering.  Thanks alot!!
5,It worked just as it claimed.  I had no leaking at all and it brewed a really great tasting cup of coffee.  Really happy that I've found these.
5,These cups and filters work excellent.  A cheaper alternative to use your own coffee.<br />Will definitely purchase more.
5,"I looked, I bought, I tried several different types of brewing cups.  For the cost and quality, these are the best! I can make a few ahead of time...using MY preferred brand of coffee. I'll, definitely, keep these in stock at my house!"
1,"The service and delivery from Amazon was great.  However, the product itself is not worth buying.  No matter what I try, coffee leaks out around the Kcup when brewing....it makes a mess!  Wanted the cups to use my favorite coffee (Tim Hortons), but guess I'll just have to get used to other brands!"
5,The pods worked as described.  I did not have overflows. I found the best way to secure the top is to press the raised area in the center of the top. Wish they were sold in larger quantities
5,"Awesome idea!  I couldn't find my husband's favorite coffee in the k-cups, so I bought these to make my own.  Works great with loose leaf teas too."
5,This product is the way to go for making your own favorite blend of coffee and loose leaf tea. I use them for tea and found that I can reuse them for two or three cups.
4,"These cups are simple and easy to use the only drawback is the fact that maybe 1/3 of the cups get caught in the unit when you open. However, they are easy to remove once you just close and reopen."
4,Handy cups were easy to fill using the enclosed stand and performed quite well. Lids fit snugly and ran well through my Keurig machine.
5,Works great. So much easier to use than the one you buy for the machine. Less mess - just throw it away!
5,What can I say - they just work. No muss no fuss. Fill the cup pop the top on and save money.
4,These cups are great. I have been reusing the originals and putting aluminum foil for the top.  These make it much easier and you can reuse them also.
4,This was a return buy. I bought 50 to try and loved them. This time I ordered 150.00. They are fab for your favorite coffee
3,"I'm not happy with these reusuable cups ! They don't hold enough coffee so when using the Keuring system, I get a small cup of coffee intead of the middle button. I hope Keurig comes out with a better reusable k cup holder."
4,"It took a couple of tries to figure out how to snap on the cap and a couple of tries to tell how much coffee to put in it for the strength preferred.  After that, it is economical and not much trouble."
4,"This is a great idea, but i find that the grounds get into the coffee, and the coffee doesn't come out of the maker as nice as the regular kcups.  It is messy as it comes out and misses the mug.  It still is nice but is not quite as good as the orginal."
5,I am very happy with the DisposaCup Single Serve Brewers. The item arrived in a timely manner and was in perfect packaging. Now I can brew my favorite brand of coffee anytime I want.
4,Received the order very fast. The lids are a little hard to get on. But they work fine. It's a good way to use your own brand of coffee if you like.
3,The cups are a little tight for my machine. You have to press down on the handle really hard. Also the lids don't fit properly unless the filter is pushed down all the way into the cup.
5,I picked these up for my wife so she could make coffee out of any brand she likes. They work perfectly in her new Keurig that I got her for Christmas. You couldn't ask for better.
5,These k-cups really save money. I can have the coffee I like and my husband can have his.  Delivery was quick and product exactly as described.  Will be buying more!
4,"I really like them, but they are sort of hard to put the lid on without crushing the cup. Wish that was easier."
5,This is a great product and you provided great customer service. Thanks so much for the opportunity to purchase this item.
5,I was happy to get the disposacups and look forward to using them.  I really like the paper filters. I am wondering if the cups can be used again. I know the lid can't. I will see what happens with this for future uses.
5,"They work great , now I can use my on coffee and that is nice only four littlt steps. Cup-filter-coffee-lid"
4,"I bought these to be able to use my favorite coffess and lessen the expensive of the prefilled K-cups.  It little bit more time consuming than the prefilled cups, but if you make several at a time, they work great."
4,This is a really good product. I had a little trouble the first couple times because I didnt tighten the lid down but besides that it is a good item.
5,"The disposable K cups allow me to use my own coffee with the Keurig single cup coffee maker, better than others I have tried."
5,I really wasn't too sure this product would work.  It has surpassed all my expectations.  I will never buy the ready made K cups again.  This is truly a genius product!
4,"They are everything I expected except for one flaw. I had trouble keeping the lever completely down on the machine.Great product and my brother was excited also and I gave him a box. I hope they are in stores soon. Such an ease to use, great idea, no clean up just throw away."
5,Works great. Seems to work wonders. Lid is tight and some times hard to put on. When you get the hang of it easy. I'll buy again.
4,Purchased these for our new coffee machine. They work very good. No issues. Using these with our regular coffee is a plus.
5,"I am impressed at how easy these are to use, much better than the one that you can buy from Keurig.<br />Great company to buy from when i go through these will reorder again"
5,"I love these cups. My husband and I like community coffee from back home  unfortunately, no kkup in their line yet.  These diapisables are perfect.  They perform just as reliably as the standard k cups with the economy and convienance of your own bulk coffees."
4,"I haven't had a chande to actually try the k-cups to see if they work as advertised.  However the order arrived on time and in excellent condition.  For this a gave the 4 star rating.  If the cups work as advertised, then this rating will jump to 5 stars."
5,"Love these cups!  I hated paying so much for my beloved Keurig coffees, the cups work great, they are convenient, easy to use and I can use whatever coffee I choose!!!!!"
5,"I put this in my dog's stocking for Christmas.  He was very pleased with the snack.  He likes regular sweet potato fries, so I thought a package of dog ones would make him happy."
3,"i bought these for my pittie who is on a sweet potato and fish diet.  i thought they would be a little larger, but they are more suitable for a smaller breed dog.  they were even a little small for my pug who gulped them down and i was afraid she would choke on them."
5,"This was a new product for our 2 ""kids""...They liked them so well we even thought of trying them! Great price, and obviously a new favorite!"
5,These are definitely the best chocolate raisins out there. They are the perfect balance of chocolate and raisin...and my boyfriend won't have any others. Too many brands have a TON of chocolate around an itty bitty raisin. What's the point? These are great and a treat!
5,These chocolate covered raisins are amazing. There is a nice balance between raisins and chocolate. I always pick up a container when I am shopping at BJ's Wholesale.
5,I have ordered these raisins multiple times.  They are always great and arrive timely. I can't go back to store bought chocolate covered raisins now! Love this product.
5,Awesome tasting nuts!  Love them?  Will be ordering them again.  The entire neighborhood wants to eat them all but I am stingy.
5,"If you want HOT peanuts, this is your product.  I have tried several other brands, and these peanuts seem to pack the most punch and have a fantastics taste."
5,Amazon has the best price in town.  Hot nuts that don't disappoint.  I would recommend trying Dave's other items as well.  Great flavor.
4,"these are some pretty darn good nuts with some spicy bite.  they wont change your life, but they are good.  the double entendre in the name is a serious bonus."
5,I've tried pretty much every pepper covered peanut (or cashew) on the market and these are by far the best.  You'd better like spicy though.
5,"Dave's Nuts are fantastic - hot, spicy. crunchy, and habit-forming.<br /><br />No babies, frail women, or wimpy men need to order!"
1,"Well, at least they live up to their name. These nuts are definitely hot, too bad that's all the positive I have to say about them. Other than that, they taste like cardboard, and not very good cardboard either."
5,"This is absolutely the best tasting coffee I have ever drank!  I can't find it locally, thankfully Amazon has saved me once again."
5,"great coffee--this was way too much to pay for it, but i could not find it anywhere else at the time.  i feel a taken advantage of price-wise and probably would not order again."
5,"I just went to Ralph's International Market, formerly Niagara Distributing, located at 3701 N. 29th Avenue, Hollywood, Florida, I got 3 pounds of Sahlen's for 15.99, they also have 5 pounds for 25.99.  They have more Buffalo favorites, Chivetta's sauce, hot sauce ... check them out!"
5,"I figure I would brag, I live in buffalo and just got 3lbs for $7.98! But seriously the best hot dogs ever"
5,i agree with Gary S. it perishable so it need to be ship over night. i ordered 5 pounds and i got it the next day. Thanks Citymade Inc.
5,"This is one of the best hot dogs made, unfortunatally it is not widely available.  Citymade must be off their rocker if they think people are gonna sale hot dogs for such a crazy price.  Granted there is 30+ weiners in a package, still a stupid price."
5,I just loved the tea.  We just add a little honey and sit back and relax.  It has a slight citrus flavor which I find very refresshing.
5,I love Ahmad tea. The Earl Grey is a wonderful tea for an afternoon sipping. The bergamot flavour isn't overpowering like some other brands I have tried.<br /><br />I will be buying more of this wonderful tea
5,"Presentation is yous perfect and product really fresh, tea bags came inside individualized plasticized aluminum bag making them to be ever-fresh. I will buy other kind of teas from this seller, hopefully they must be as excellent as the Earl Grey one."
5,"Having tried a very large number of Earl Grey teas, I've been struck by how particularly flavorful this brand is.  It's really worth trying.  I ended up buying the pack of 6 boxes twice I liked it so much."
4,"This is my wife's absolute favorite Earl Grey.  Me, I find that while the Bergamot flavor is nice, I like a tea base that is a bit brisker."
5,"Nice serving size, good complement to breakfast.  Low in fat, high in protein, and taste great.  I keep the unused portion in the freezer and microwave them, or heat them in a pan if you want a crispier outside.  They are pre-cooked.  Love 'em!"
1,MADE IN CHINA..<br />Even our dog food has gone the way of the Hershey Kiss. I won't be back to this vendor.<br />Will be looking for made and sold in AMERICA only.....
5,"Was surprised of the inexpensive price tag and skeptical when purchased.  As it turns out, it is a charming and unique gift and a great buy for the price!"
5,REALLY good mix. Pleasantly surprised to find it includes macadamia nuts. We will enjoy this mix immensely. I am sure we will order it again.
5,"This is a fantastic product, arrived fresh and it's a good price with subscribe and save. I will be keeping this subscription."
2,The price was comparable to Walmart for same size product.  However these nuts were not as crunchy; and they needed a little more salt.
5,I thought these had avery good flavor.  I took two tubs to work and most of the people liked them.  Two or three people commented that they liked them better than some other brands because they are not salty.
3,"They do not taste like a good high quality nut, i dont know if it was the lack of salt but they were not for me"
1,These are a cheap fake. Nothing like the real Emerald nuts you buy in the store. Its a complete waste of money. DONT get ripped off like I did.
5,The stuff is great but I'll pay at most $4 or $5 for four bottles.
4,"I just purchased this today for 3.99. I can't believe this price. The product is wonderful however. Nice soda like fizz, but juicy instead of cloyingly sweet."
5,"This product is excellent. At my local store, they struggle to keep enough on the shelves. It is usually priced at $4.99 for 4 bottles, which is expensive as it is. I would try not to spend more than this."
5,"This tea was a gift. We are down to the last two tea bags, and I had been unable to find it. Alas, it was on the find anything site-Amazon. This particular herbal blend doesn't sound particularly appealing, but one taste and you will be hooked. A smooth, complex blend. Just lovely."
5,"I just love these - have tried several flavors ..  gives a gluten freer a chance to snack on a crunchy, healthy snack!!"
5,"Sticks and Twigs may seem a little pricey compared to regular pretzels, but the bag lasts a long time and the ingredients, like flax seeds, quinoa, chia seeds and curry, are good for you. They are very crunchy, but tasty. For some added protein, I like to dip them in peanut butter."
1,"Good quality product, but you would have to REAlly love curry flavor to like these... They are so awful I don't know what to do with them, but I know I won't be eating them.... I'll stick to the plain sea salt ones:)"
5,OK this poor guy begged my daughter to make him my pecan pie and well she is a microwave girl! So for christmass what better way to a man than his stomach.  he now has pies he can pack in his lunch box.  They are sssooooo good.
1,Lacks the flavor I was hoping for and the price was a bit high for the satisfaction level.  I won't be ordering this again.  Live and learn.
5,"Snappy White Popcorn is excellent.  It pops up nicely, and has a great texture. It is extremely fresh. As for taste it is 100 times better than the store brands. (IMO) Give it a try."
5,"Although the kernels may not be as large and fluffy when popped, we really enjoyed our first pop. Has a great flavor and consistency.<br />We recommend using a hot air popper over a microwave. We had very few no-pops."
5,"I've always bought yellow popcorn, but after reading the reviews for Snappy white I decided to give it a try. It's tender and delicious! I'll be ordering more, it's now my favorite popcorn."
5,"Snappy's White Popcorn is perfect.  It's hulless, tiny, tender and crunchy when popped, and it always pops.  We keep it in the freezer so it's always fresh, and more importantly, ALWAYS HERE when we want some. As midwesterners, we know corn, okay?  And this is the best!"
5,I tried thhis popcorn in a the Presto Poplite Air Popcorn machine.  the instructions were easy and the results were very gratifying.  I added sea salt and a little Olive oil.  The measuring container made 5 quarts.  I just  couldn't stop eating it.  Simply delicious.
4,"This popcorn leaves very few old maids. It's fresh, so the kernels pop as bi as they should (unlike some other brands I've purchased). My only criticism is that there are lots of hulls. But of the three brands of popcorn I've recently bough for use in my microwave popcorn popper, it's the best."
5,"We are white popcorn enthusiasts, and were very pleased with this product.  Large, tender kernels of poped corn.  Used an electric, self stirring poper.  Worth the cost."
5,Snappy white popcorn is one of the best popcorn I have ever tried. Very tasty and most every kernel pops every time.
5,"I love this brand (I ordered 1st via Amazon). Great, fluffy corn, with very few un-popped kernels in my hot air popper. Didn't try the old-fashioned fry-pan method, but expect similar results. Definitely will buy again when needed."
5,VERY good popcorn!  I believe even better than Orville's brand.  A little on the expensive side but you do get a lot of popcorn.
5,We only like white popcorn and since it's hard to find in the grocery store it's great to order this.  It was yummy and plentiful!  Recommend!
5,This is the best white popcorn yet! I've tried the others sold on Amazon & there's no comparison. It was fluffy & flavorful & almost every kernel popped!(how often can you say that?) I've already ordered more so I won't run out.
5,"Good product.  Almost all the popcorn pops up fluffy and snow white.  With our air popper, great snack with few calories.  Taste great!"
2,"So far I'm not impressed with this popcorn. It's tender when popped, but it's really annoying how much doesn't pop. I'm going to add a little water and then let it sit, closed up, for a while and see if that helps. As of right now, I wouldn't buy this popcorn again."
5,"If you enjoy a rich flavored cheddar cheese with a bite of horseradish, I would give this a try. It was a instant party favorite when I brought this and crackers to friends house.  I would recommend this to anyone!"
5,"Love these Soy Nuts, especially the garlic and onion blend!!!!  Perfect for taking to a party or just snacking on while on the go.  Been happy with every product from Truson."
5,"The onion garlic soy nuts are my favorite.  They add a great hit of flavor to salads, and the added bonus is they're good for you."
5,"I like the onion garlic flavor.  It really tastes good, very fresh and it is much healthier for you than other non organic soy nuts. I like to add them to my salads instead of croutons."
5,These crackers are incredible. Healthy and tasty - you can't go wrong. The Italian and Mexican Harvest are my favorites. The cinnamon are great for breakfast with yogurt. Buying the six pack allowed me to taste all to see which ones I would order again.
3,"The flavors are really good but the crackers get a bit slimy as you chew them. If that doesn't bother you, then they're a great low-carb snack."
5,Nuttzo makes great nut butters. Their chocolate version is like Nutella should be--less sugar and other crap. Delicious and super-nutritious.
2,I bought a bottle of tapatio hot sauce for my friend to have it shipped over to her in the east coast. The order said it'd take 5 business days. It ended up taking over 3 weeks
5,Some people mentioned the loose tea is difficult to filter.<br /><br />USE A FRENCH PRESS made for coffee is a good option - dilute concentrate to desire strength. My favorite flavors are: Mango and Passion Fruit.
5,My whole family is addicted to this tea.  We make it in our Mr. Coffee Iced Tea Maker - it's fabulous!
5,"We are big fans of the Passion Fruit Tea but wanted to try something different. I like all of the flavors but the blackberry is my fave for a change of pace, still got to have the passion fruit as the go to tea though. Everyone raves about how good this stuff is. I can't make enough."
5,"Many food establishments serve Chna Mista tea and I love<br />the flavor, I was happy to be able to purchase it on Amazon.<br />I make it my iced tea maker it's so easy and has a great<br />taste with less caffeine. Try it you will love it too."
1,I'm sorry I bought this brand. It leaves a lousy after taste in your mouth.No wonder Amazon is giving .99cent shipping on this item. STAY AWAY!!! AVOID!!!!
2,"The flavor of Big Train Hazelnut is not significant. One has to add a lot to have a flavor impact. Of the three Big Train flavors I purchased (including Vanilla and Irish Creme), Hazelnut is the least satisfactory. (Vanilla's a little better; Irish Creme is best--I gave that one 4 stars)."
5,"I use this syrup in tea, coffee and over cut up fruit and ice cream.I buy unflavored creamer and add this to it. Much cheaper alternative to pre-flavored coffee creamer."
5,"So i had this cheese on my mind ever since trying it at a restaurant in SF.  This was one of those things that i though when Im bored and want to burn money on shipping i would order.  Is it worth it?  Yes if you are a cheese fan,  goes great with any wine).  Not so much if you are being curious."
5,"Last night they predicted an ice storm and I was going to have the day off for MLK, so I knew that this was the day to make soup.  This one is excellent!  My only addition to the recipe was a ham bone and about a cup of rice.  It made a great, satisfying supper.  Pat"
5,This soup has fantastic flavor. I did not add the canned tomatoes but I did add all the extra vegetables in the my fridge.
4,"This coffee tastes pretty good, and I like the fact that it's organic (coffee has one of he highest rates of pesticides).  However, each time I use Subscribe & Save, unfortunately, the price seems to get raised substantially a few weeks later, which is why I had to cancel my subscription to this."
5,Hooray for an all natural sweetner! Say goodbye to sugar and chemical based sweetners and get your hands on this stevia!
5,"My father-in-law bought some for me to try. Love it! Very sweet. NO aftertaste. Wonderful all-natural sweetener. My new choice, replacing all those other artificial packets I used to use."
5,"I bought this vinegar along with 2 others for my father for Christmas. I wish they could have all been shipped together, but they went separately. Good vinegar though."
1,"Very disappointed, not much pumpkin or spice, just pretty close to plain old coffee.  I was hoping for something like they have at Tim Horton's but its not even close."
5,Excellent product. Exactly what they said it would be. Superior chamomile from what I have ordered before from other companies. Excellent value for the price.
5,"Though it's hardly real coffee, my wife loves this stuff.  She says it's like having hot caramel ice cream in a cup.  Amazon's 4-pk price is much better than store price...if it can be found in a store."
5,"Nice and smooth. Hopefully, GF or Maxwell will not discontinue this flavor like they have my other two. They losing my business!"
5,Love this flavor!  I make mine with vanilla soy milk and 1% milk.  Very nice!  Almost like a dessert!
5,"This is so soothing, smooth, & rich! Love this as my afternoon treat! GF does have a history of discontinuing great favors, I hope this one sticks around. (Kahlua, White Chocolate to name a couple!)"
5,"We have a little shih tzu who absolutely loves Cesar Softies dog treats.  We have tried different flavors, but she seems to enjoy the Grilled Chicken Flavor the most.  They are soft enough to break in half, and that is more than enough to satisfy a little dog's yearning for a reward."
5,"I HAVE SO MUCH FUN WATCHING MY PUPPIES ASKING FOR THIS CHICKEN TREATS. THEY GO CRAZY WHEN I SHOW THEM THE BLUE PACKAGE. THESE TREATS ARE SMALL, EASY TO EAT AND DOES NOT HAVE A BAD SMELL. I RECOMMEND IT, YOUR PUPPIES WILL BE HAPPY."
5,I used this treat as training reward and my dog loves it. easy to break into smaller pieces. will buy again
5,"My Westie - like the picture on the package - loves these treats!  They are the perfect size for a treat or reward and even look cute...we call them<br />""puppy paws"" treats!  Good texture - no mess!  Smell not attractive to humans - but good to a dog!"
5,"The price is very good compared to any retail outlet available to me.  Came in a simple plastic bag, which I plopped in the freezer.  We can pull out a bag, and have fresh treats for our little guy who so richly deserves and loves them."
5,My dogs love the Cesar's softies.  Get best price from this site.  The dog's are a bit picky about their treats and this one is great!  Thanks.
5,"I HAVE A COTON DE TULEAR...I KNOW...WHAT IS THAT??? THEY'RE FROM MADAGASCAR...QUITE BEAUTIFUL,.VERY SPOILED (OF COURSE) & VERY FINICKY...HE JUST LOVES THESE TREATS"
5,This is The best dog food their is because everything is very. Digestible and when the dog does digest it all digested because they use all the nutrition from it. So it is healther and the best out their far as I'm think
5,I've used Natures Logic Dog Food for about a year.  The difference in my dogs is impressive.  Their coats are like silk.  What a wonderful product!
5,"I hate flavored coffee, unless it is flavored with dark rum!  This coffee is awesome.  I got a variety pack of these potful packs and there were ony 3 of 20 that I liked.  This is the only one I reordered."
5,If you like flavored coffee this is one  you must try.<br />Rich taste but not strong.<br />Smells wonderful. So good you will want to stay home and SIP on it all day.
5,Jamacian me crazy is sooo good. My husband who normally adds cream to disguise the bitterness drinks it without cream . Let my mom and cousin try it and they too love it!  Definitely worth trying.
5,"Red mill's pumkin seeds are simply the best! Other seeds or ""pepitas"" don't come even close. Red mill's seeds are crunchy and very tasty. They are product of the U.S., not China like most pepitas. Well worth the price!"
5,"Usually, healthy food is hard to swallow. Not these, fresh, crunchy, delicious pumpkin seeds. I switched from potato chips and my wife tells me they are good for the prostate. What do I know? I'm taking her word for it."
5,"I only ever had pumpkin seeds before in cereal, in small amounts.  These are great; just add them to Bob's granola, or yogurt; even just plain by the handful, they are great."
5,Love Bob's Redmill the best of the best. Pay a little more than the other guys but all american and employee owned!!! Pumpking seeds are high on the calorie chart so just a teaspoon at a time!!
5,These are not only one of the few pumpkin seeds grown in the USA . They are great and  fresh every time.
5,because these are more expensive than some of the other brands. I decided to order since they had great reviews and are a product of the USA. I'm sure glad I did because these are delicious! My whole family likes them straight out of the package. We've not yet taken the time to roast them.
5,I sprinkle these on Oat Groats or just grab a handful and munch.  I transferred the contents of the package to a ziplock once I opened it and keep it in the freezer to ensure freshness.
5,i liked the idea theses were from the U.S.A.  and loved the taste and quality..i will buy more..they are a great source of iron.. and i take them with me everywhere i go for a healthy bit to eat...
5,Lot of pumpkin seeds in this box of 4 packages. Fresh quality product & 24 oz packages made this box a good investment & easy to share with friends & family! Far less expensive than buying these seeds at the grocery store!
2,"The ones I received were mostly yellowish in color with some light green instead of dark green, dry and somewhat stale, they may have been in a warehouse longer that they should have!"
5,"If you are a man this is the best you can do for your health, eat Pumpkin Seeds.  Bob's Red Mill has the best grown here in the good old USA.  The others are from China, enough said."
4,"I like these so well that I signed up for the subscription rate where they mail you automatically every month or so - your choice.<br /><br />We eat a lot of these, but I've not roasted them yet. Most nuts taste better roasted, so why not?  Looking forward to it."
3,The pumpkin seeds I received from the Bob's Red Mill company were stale and contained a lot of small seed fragments.
5,"These came fresh, and sprout well for me. I am very pleased with them. They make a tasty and nutritious addition to our salads. As usual, Amazon delivery and postage was great with the super saving shipping option."
5,They are raw so I put them on a cookie shhet no spray and dry roast them at 350 for 7 to 9 min. Then they have a roasted flavor without any of the oils.Cankeep in freezer to keep fresh.VEry yummy. Great on salads.
5,Just excellent product !!!!. I would buy it again. It is better than I was expecting. I do not have any complain about it.
5,"These Pumpkin Seeds are the quality I have grown to expect from Bob's products. This is the best price I have been able to find on pumpkin seeds and enjoy them on a daily basis, especially in the morning with oatmeal."
5,"Researched a lot on internet before buying these.. great price, great taste... completly happy with my purchase... although a bit expensive, but a quality product does comes with a price tag !!!!"
5,I have only eaten the raw and they were as expected.  I'll be roasting some up this weekend but I'm always happy with Bob's products.  A+ company.
5,"There is nothing better than a huge baked sweet potato with (real) butter and Splenda Brown Sugar totally covering the butter and sweet potato, makes me want to fix one right now!"
5,I use this on my oatmeal every morning.  I can't tell the difference between this and brown sugar.  No 'after taste'.
5,"This taste just like brown sugar with less sugar.<br />I use this for everything , that requires sugar (baking ,est..) I use less of this than is required, like if it says use 1/2 cup I use 1/3 of splenda brown sugar."
5,"This mix of Splenda and sugar works pretty  well for me. A teaspoon of it is enough for a large cup of coffee, and it tastes like a real brown sugar."
5,I just love this. Even on my diet I can have hot & yummy oameal...It is satisfing & without that rich brown sugar flavor its just not the same taste...Love it!!!
5,I've been using this to cook with for over a year.  Never had a problem with it.  Love it!
5,"Love this substitute for brown sugar.  Always stays moist and no one can tell that I am using it, instead of regular brown sugar."
5,I have used this in my baking with the regular splenda and it works great! Always trying to cut calories with out loosing flavor. Works great in my muffins with just a touch of sugar.
5,Baking for my husband (with type 2 diabetes) just go easier.<br />I can adapt regular receipes. I use only half the amount of sugar called for a Bam! they turn out great. The 4 pack is a great buy too!
2,"This is simply a mix of brown sugar and Splenda, I am sure it would be cheaper to make your own"
5,If you are looking to cut out some cal and want a great taste then go with this. I keep getting it sent to me every 6 months. Love it!!
4,"I purchased this item to bake some low carb cookies for a diabetic friend.  This works well for that, however, I did find that there is another brown sugar alternative that is calorie free.  Both options worked well in the cookies."
3,I made the mistake of thinking that this product was simply Brown sugar flavored Splenda. I didn't read the product details stating that it actually has brown sugar in it.. My mistake...
5,"Who ever is making French's Potato Sticks,Keep it up! They are the best! French's should have keep them in their line.Mike"
5,"My 10 month old son has been a fan of Yummy Spoonfuls from his first bite. The Garden Medley flavor is a new favorite. The puree is thick and almost creamy, perfect for a baby who likes his food to have texture. He's always happy when I bring a cup of this to his tray!"
5,"First package was lost in the mail, but JR shipped a backup at no charge with 24 hour shipment!!!!"
5,"Not only are the truffles excellent, but the package arrived in record speed with standard shipping chosen.  We are very pleased with our truffles and with our experience with this company.  We will be ordering from them again!"
2,I though this product lack flavor as I taste different brands far better.<br />There were no real flavor as I expected. Sorry
2,Had no taste and after the heat of the dish it was on turned them to a leathery tecture. Better off buying the high price truffles.
1,There was absolutly no scent or flavor to this.When I brought home truffles from Aosta in Italy they were wonderful and cost less. These were worthless.
1,"i ordered this in the past and was extremely disappointed. they are unlike truffles that i know of. they were hard like a huge seed, had no truffle aroma. i threw all contents out. will never order them again"
1,"I am the biggest fan of mushrooms you'll ever meet, but these are really disgusting. They taste like dirt. I have to imagine better quality truffles (if these are even truffles at all) are muuuuch better. They'd have to be. There'd be no comparison. These are really bad."
5,"This review is mostly about the seller.  They are great!  The product arrived within 2 days, with standard shipping.<br /><br />I have never had black truffles before.  They have a very earthy, smoky flavor that really emerges when lightly sauteed in butter.  They are an expensive, pleasant, treat."
5,This is our second time using your black winter truffles....they are truly delicious. We throw them in with pasta and truffle oil to have the world's best dish...reminds of our stay in Tuscany. This is a quality product and we plan on buying again in the near future.
5,"Recieved the truffles in one day shipping the customer service is over the top...I opened the jar and enjoyed the aroma, I will shop with them again"
5,"Clean taste and clean energy.<br /><br />Packaging is attractive, simple, and elegant as well.<br /><br />Sustainable sourcing and organic cert round out the whole package.<br /><br />Overall nice product."
5,"Wow this Chocolate Raspberry flavored coffee is the absolute best we have ever had and I can honestly say we have tried quite a few in our time. And of course the price can't be beat unless you find someone who wants to sell you some that ""fell"" off the back of some delivery truck."
4,I was surprised how much raspberry flavor the coffee has.  The coffee has a nice aroma and a suddal chocolate flavor.  I will get this flavor again.
5,We really enjoy this coffee. We recommend to store it in an airtight container after opening to maintain it's full flavor. We enjoy it as an evening coffee.
5,Nice small nutritious biscuit. Nice pocket size. Resealable pouch is a plus as well. Will order more in the future.
5,I am so happy to have found a wonderful decaf tea for myself and guests. This tea is nice and full flavored and has a very smooth finish. I usually use the K-cup twice on xl setting and the tea remains true and delicious. The price is the best i have found anywhere
5,"Twinings English Breakfast Decaffeinated Tea was exactly what I was looking for.  I loved the English Breakfast tea but needed to find a decaf version.  The taste is great, the price is right, and I'm sold!"
5,"Great tasting tea - in fact, much better then the bags of same. I'm an Decaf Irish Breakfast tea drinker but can't find that in K-Cups.  English Breakfast in K-cups tastes great!!"
5,I have been drinking Twining's tea for years.  It used to be made in England but now they have a plant in North Carolina for the American trade.  The tea is excellent. I drink the decaf for health reasons and find that it is as tasty as the regular tea.
3,This is a pretty good cup of tea. I just wish PG Tips made pods for the Keurig brewer.  Maybe eventually!
4,i just purchased a kurig and this was one of the first k cups i bought i still use it  but if it was decaf would be better than id rate it five starts
5,"I made the pink lemonade cake mix and used this frosting to frost it for Mother's day, and it was a huge success. My mother, who doesn't normally like cake really enjoyed this. I thought it had just the right blend of tangy and sweet. I hope this flavor sticks around, because it was really good!"
5,"This is my favorite of all the choices of coffee for the new Vue. I don't like strong-tasting coffee - I prefer Dunkin Donuts over Starbucks. Until they come out with a Dunkin Donuts vue pack, this light roast is perfect for me."
1,This is an awful coffee. The flavor is extremely weak and tastes more like a lemon grass tea than coffee.
4,"makes a nice lager that's quite a bit heavier than the domestic lager beers. I don't plan on making any more, but has more to do with my love of dark ales than the quality/flavor of this kit."
5,I have been brewing this beer off and on for the past five years along with many others. When it comes time to pour a glass it has never let me down. Even without using lagering methods it always develops into a a tasty drink.
5,"I got my husband a brew kit from Coopers for his birthday. The Lager is the only beer he's tried to brew, but he says it's very easy and it tastes good. It tastes best if you only let it ferment in the bottles for a week. We're definitely going to try other flavors."
5,"These are delicious and addictive.  They are touted as ""healthy""  but I didn't see anything particularly healthy in the nutritional list.  But they aren't unhealthy, which is good enough for me.  The best thing about them?  Costco is carrying them now.  Can't vouch for next month."
5,"The 180 Snacks Almond Pops with blueberries are the best. I love the bite sized pieces. The flavor is fantastic. Very crunchy, not too sweet, nutty and fruit flavored at the same time. The perfect healty snack."
2,"Love the taste of this product, really keeps you full with just a small amount.  First bought it at Costco, they no longer sell this product.  The reason for the two stars, half the bag was crushed, could eat it with a spoon."
5,SO CRUNCHIE GOOD!  HEALTHY ~ AND THE KIDS LOVE EM!  WHAT MORE DO YOU WANT IN A SNACK.  (BESIDES A 12-STEP PROGRAM TO STOP EATING THEM.)  THEY'RE FANTASTIC!!!
5,"Grandpa Po's Originals are crunchy nuggets made from organic popcorn and organic soybeans. The healthy snack offers the benefits of soy without genetically modified organisms, cholesterol, peanuts or preservatives. In addition, the snack is low in saturated fat and it tastes great."
5,"Indoors, outdoors, wherever you go - Grandpa Po's Originals provide families with a fun, tasty anytime treat! They're perfect for playing; they're super for school lunches...& serious snacking, too!"
5,I love snacks and Grandpa Po's Originals are a great snack to satisfy a hunger craving. They are crunchy and have great flavor. It's hard to stop eating the whole bag in one sitting!
5,Great for the munchies or when you just need something to snack on.  I love popcorn so this was just what the doctor ordered. Just perfect for me.
5,"This is a very good snack and good for you. Price was good. Shipping not bad, but good for distance."
4,"I tried this snack because it looked healthy, so I didn't expect it to be too great. I was wrong --- it is very very good! I'll buy more when my supply runs low.<br />John D"
5,"These are really good!  I find Grandpa Po's Originals to be filling and delicious, and since they're technically whole grain, they are way better to have in the house than Doritos."
5,"Granda Po's are the perfect snack when you crave something crunchy and delicious.  They are also very healthy so you can enjoy them guilt-free.  I love all the flavors.  My son begs me for them, so now he's a fan too.  I even shipped them to my brother's platoon in Iraq.  Everyone loved them!"
4,I bought some of this. Creates an awesome effect on decorated cakes and candies. Love it! Completely edible.<br /><br />But WAYYY overpriced on Amazon. Usually Amazon is cheaper than buying in stores but these are only $4 at any craft store so $15 is SEVERELY overpriced.
5,It's awesome.  The dust gave my cake pops a great sparkle to it.  I used White and purple candy melts.  I would recommend this to anyone.
5,My daughter loves painting this stuff on cake pops. It add just a little color if painted on dry but the color is more vibrant if mixed with extract and painted on.
5,"we enljoy having Loumidis greek coffee every day.Iam an expert making the coffee. When my mother in law was alive she wanted to have greek coffee every day at four in the afternoon, so kept the trantition"
4,"Not as tasty as some of the others out there, but for the bulk, I'd pay again."
3,"The product was fair, not as ""country"" as I would like, but better than you find in a grocery store."
5,Cant make corn tortillas or tamales without masa harina. These folks ship their product in sturdy boxes. Great for making a long journey overseas.
5,these make a good and very filling lunch with a little bit of lemon juice squeezed over them.
5,"With cayenne pepper, it is about the quantity you get for a price and I believe I got a very very good bargain.  Doesn't happen often, but it is so nice when it does.<br /><br />Thanks"
5,"Yes, there are higher HU products but this is exactly what is advertised.  I use this to make a tincture to reduce high blood pressure.  Comment if you want more info."
5,good product and fast delivery with follow up.<br />90k is very hot and I'm drinking it 3 time a day :)<br />Will buy again.
5,"Good stuff, take it easy if your not used to it. it improves taste of food, better breathing, better circulation, helps with arthritis a bit"
5,"This is the best cayenne that I have used.The taste and aroma is a bit more mellow than other 90,000 HU cayenne powder from the past,but definetly delivers the kick!!!"
5,I actually bought this to use as a squirrel repellant (which it worked fantastically) safe to treat your gardens with. HOWEVER i found myself using this to cook more than anything else. Tastes great when sprinkled over wings
5,"The pepper is great!!  Plan on using it to keep squirrels off of suet, but will try it for cooking also. Price was great.  One note though, product is pictured in a jar and although it says packaging may be different, it should say sold in pouches somewhere.  I thought I was getting a jar."
5,much better than the stuff you get from the grocery store and so much cheaper...i'll be buying more when i run out...i use it on food and i put it in gel caps to take as a supplement...
5,"I recommend this product & timliness of the delivery. I especially prefere Cayenne ground with 90,000 heat units. This is a good one.<br />I highly recommend.<br />Stanley E. Ford"
5,Please correct my original review as I made an error<br /><br />My experience was completely satisfactory-----Excellant product and service!<br /><br />Sorry about the error.<br /><br />S G Lilly
5,THIS SELLER WAS GREAT!!!RECIEVED MY ORDER IN ABOUT 4 DAYS!!! THE CAYENNE IS GREAT!!!NICE FLAVOR AND HOT JUST THE WAY I LIKE IT!!! wILL BE BACK FOR MORE AFTER THE 2LBS ARE GONE!!! THANKS FOR A GREAT PRODUCT AT A GOOD PRICE!!!
5,"One, one, wonderful ... from the Beach Boys ""Smile"" album.<br />This tea is that ... wonderful aroma and taste.<br />Try it and Smile !!!<br /><br />And .. It always ships on time !!!"
5,"I absolutely love Lana's Snowflake tea! I received a sample when I ordered the Finum Permanet Filter through Amazon (which, by the way, is the best filter I have ever used!). I fell in love with the Snowflake tea and had to order some for myself. It's fantastic!"
5,I bought this at a shop because it sounded good (I love coconut) and it was awesome!  It's become my favorite tea.
5,"This tea is my favorite, I've never had any tea that could match it.  Please consider making it in a decaf version so I can curl up and enjoy it in the evening also!"
5,"Recieved the tea very quickly with very  helpful, detailed brewing instructions.  Tea is absolutely delicious!!!!!!  Like dessert in a cup!!!!"
5,"Although Dundee's orange marmalade is stocked everywhere, their hard-to-find ginger preserve is truly incredible. I have tried many other brands but this one is truly classic with the intense ginger flavor I love. Try it on a warm English muffin, crunchy fresh waffles or as a roast chicken glaze."
5,Found these locally in Chicago about 6 months ago.  Amazon's price is high but these are definitely the best I have ever tried.  My wife and I cook with it and just spread it on toast or crackers.  The white jar is also distinctive.
5,"For those who enjoy ginger, the Dundee preserves taste great on crackers and bread.  The texture allows for easy spreading, but it is not runny.  It also stays fresh if stored in the refrigerator."
5,"On an English muffin, the day starts off best with the mild taste of ginger!"
4,"Always used the Robertsons ginger, This production is almost as good, but the price is inflated for the size of the jar.the product was packed well (glass jars) and arrived promptly."
4,This spread is just right but costs only about six dollars locally.<br />price with shipping here is ridiculous!
2,Second time I have reported this. One jar broken and order<br />Not what pictured. Jam same but jar different. I know my ginger<br /><br />This not same.
4,"great coffees & I enjoyed the most when friends come over for coffee, it gives lot of fun to try out all the flovor"
5,"This stuff is pure, natural, creamy goodness. Perfect for using in recipes and for eating straight out of the tub!"
5,"Since Swanson's Sun Butter only contains roasted Sunflower Seeds and no other ingredients, it is the only nut butter product we buy!"
5,"This is a sun butter with absolutely fresh roasted-sunflower-seed taste. I was pleasantly surprised from the first taste. Shipping is very reasonable also. I trust Swansons, but still I was astounded by how good this tastes!"
5,"When a peanut butter addict like me says this is better, it is saying a lot<br />Wonderfull flavor, Very creamy texture, almost to creamy, more like a puree.<br />Not to oily or sweet, just right. doesn't stick to the roof of your mouth.<br />Organic makes it even better and healthier"
4,"No sugar or anything added to the product. I have to add honey to it when I eat it and it tastes fine with honey.<br />Quality seems fine to me, it seems a bit oily compared to peanut butter, but it never gets hard like peanut butter does even keeping it in the fridge."
5,"Although Sun Butter tastes like sunflower seeds and nothing like peanut butter, it still tastes great and has a smooth creamy texture.  The only drawback I noticed was that it's a little runny compared to peanut butter."
1,"tastes - burnt, roasted, slightly rotten sunflower seed taste; gritty, bland - no salt,sugar only seeds. would not eat if it was free."""
5,Just received this butter yesterday and we are already using it to make sandwiches with jelly. Tastes great without having any salt or sugar added. Highly recommend!
4,This organic sunflower butter is the only one I can find with the least additives. My only alternative is to make my own and this saves time.
5,I ordered this product because I wanted alternative to peanut butter and it is organic. I actually prefer the creamy sunflower taste over peanut butter now...definitely would buy again!
5,"This stuff is great!!!!! I'm allergic to peanuts ( just happened over night ) and I miss having a PBJ, so this is the next best thing to it. :-) Truly, this butter is all that and then some...."
5,"Per the manufacturer, the product is organic and only made from Sunflower seeds.  It tastes very natural and fresh.  I would highly recommend if you like the natural taste of Sunflower seeds."
5,"I really like the fruity taste of this tea - so much so that I can actually drink it without sugar.  If you like fruity teas, you should try this product."
5,My husband and I absolutely love this gum that is actually good for you!!! It keeps flavor for a long time!!!!
5,"A bit pricy, but well worth it to avoid the garbage found in other gums.  Made in USA and delicious."
5,"I love B-Fresh cinnamon gum! It tastes great, it's good for you and it temporarily freshens your breath. Now the flavor doesn't last a long time but with 100 pieces you have plenty to chew on."
4,"I love this gum, but i gave it 4 stars because the flavor does not last long...  You'll enjoy it though."
4,Great for when you're pregnant or nursing...no artificial anything....INCLUDING NO Aspartame.  Yay!  The Bubble gum is the best gum in the whole world.  LOVE this gum.
5,I've been buying these at the grocery store every week for a year. My husband and I eat WP's soups every day for lunch. I am so happy Amazon can deliver to my doorstep.
1,"This soup is advertised as ""creamy,"" however when it arrived it was ""signature.""  Puck changed the recipe of the Creamy Butternut Squash Soup and is now calling it Signature Butternut Squash Soup.  It does not taste the same (and is not as good) as the original recipe."
5,"Very good soup, light and creamy. Added curry gives just right spice to the  taste. Love it! Highly recommend to try it, you won't put your spoon down until you ate it all."
1,"The soup is rich and tasty, but DON'T buy it from Amazon.  The packaging is so poor that the cans arive dented as did the replacement shipment. I got my money back but now have to pay more to buy this wonderful soup from my local grocer."
5,This Mac & Cheese is really creamy without tasting processed and it has the right amount of salt. Very good product overall.
5,I am a big fan of anything Annie's so it is no surprise I give these 5 stars. There is simply no comparison between 'the chessiest' and the truly chessiest mac & cheese - which is Annie's. I enjoy the white cheddar the most.
1,This is twice as expensive as basic box Mac and Cheese.  It is just so so in taste.  If you check the ingredients it is not much different than other Mac and Cheese.  The cost does not justify the ordering.  I will not be ordering from Amazon again.  The cost is much cheaper at a big box chain.
4,"Annie's has a great line of food, and this macaroni and cheese is great. Kids like it; grown-ups like it!!"
5,"Our family really enjoys this shells and cheese. I love the convenience of Mac and Cheese, but usually the flavor is horrible. Annie's tastes great and is better for you. Can't beat that."
5,Very yummy!  My kids and I loved it!  Cute story on the box too!
4,My whole family really enjoys Annie's mac & cheese! The reason I gave it 4 stars was due to the high salt content---common to all boxed dinners.
5,All Annie's products are excellent. Beats the other name brands<br /><br />for flavor. It's organic with no additives. Good item to keep on hand for a quick lunch.
2,"I love Annie's, but this had no taste, very bland and unappealing. I would not purchase this again, but worst of all I'm stuck with 6 boxes...boo!"
5,I could not be more pleased with the bread machine mixes.  They are delicious.  The service was outstanding.
1,The bread has a good taste but does not rise properly and only makes 1/2 loaf.  I checked the temp of the water as suggested with bad results.  After raising the temp to 100 degrees I got it to rise to 3/4 loaf.  Pretty expensive for the quality and I won't buy again.
5,Earthborn is the best grain free dog food and it is reasonably priced. This food is calorie dense and so good for your dogs.
5,"My puppy loves the stuff.  His poo is proper consistency since switching, his coat is beautiful, and he treats the stuff like, well, a treat.  Can't wait to try the other flavors with him.<br /><br />The ingredients list is tough to beat for the price.<br /><br />-Jim"
5,"Since switching our golden retrieve from his regular dog food to grain-free, his skin allergies are much lessened.  And this grain-free dog food is great.  It smells good even to me.  And to see it available at Amazon with the Super Saver Free Shipping is wonderful!"
4,"I have to disagree with another reviewer; I did not find this PB gritty at all.  I always but natural PB without any added sugar and also did not find this too sweet.  It has a nice, not overpowering, taste of maple.  Great snack on rice cakes!"
5,My vodka tonics have never been so refreshing.  I wish I would have ordered two cases now as my husband and I are going through far too much.
5,"My Venus fly trap arrived promptly and in great condition! Thanks for the great service! Amazon is forcing me to write more words against my will because they are fascists.  Have a great day, everyone!"
5,"Healthy plant received on time.  No issues, just the way I like it.  :-)"
4,"There was a little damage in shipment which might be expected, but it is growing and catching flies...with a little help!"
1,"Plant was dead on arrival and was mangled in its container, probably better to buy one locally. I dont think its gonna make it...."
4,it came in good shape altho the plant came a little twisted and two were dead but worth every penny and six head were still alive very happy
1,The plant was upside down in the box and I had to put the roots back inside the planter.  It never came out of shock and turned black and died.
4,I received my plant it was in great condition!!!  I have a question the box says its supposta stay in box for terrium. im a little confused how is it supposta catch flies if its in a box.. can anyone tell me the direction in  a not so confusing way lol
1,"Hi  - ordered the Venus fly trap...very quick service, nice vendor, but the plant died and turned black...over the next 3 days after we got it..."
1,"i had a second plant to replace the first one. it to came in sad shape,<br />i should of went to a local nursery at least then i would of got a good plant.<br />dont waste your time with this vender."
5,this plant arrived packaged Excellently.  it was very healthy and came with good instructions for growing.  we will enjoy raising these.
5,I was very pleased with my venus fly trap when I received it.  It was in good shape and came very quickly.  We have been having a lot of fun feeding it bugs.
1,The plant arrived dead.  It cost as much to ship.  I did not want to hassle with any kind of return.  I should know better than to buy a plant on line.
1,"I received an undersized, sickly plant that could not be nurtured back to health. What was I thinking ordering a plant over the Internet? Never again!"
1,"It only lasted 2 days. Came mostly dead. Glad it was only 10 bucks. It was also very small so. The flies I wanted it to eat , it couldn't."
5,I bought this as a gift for my sister and her family who live in Arizona. They were so excited when it came and it was small enough to not be a bother but big enough to be interesting and pretty. They were pleased. It came almost right away (days!) and the package was in good shape.
5,"We love the little Venus Flytrap,<br />it's healthy, hungry, and producing new shoots.<br />It arrived quickly and in good condition.<br />Altogether a positive experience."
5,Fly traps were for a science fair experiment. They arrived promptly and were in very good shape.All approximately the same size-important for the experiment.
5,"We live in the country so flies are very bothersome.  This plant is probably stuffed, its working overtime. Each mouth has about three flies, I would think that is too many to digest but hey its eating flies like its suppose to."
2,"I received the pant faster than expected, but it was brown and considerably smaller than advertised. I have very little hope that this plant will live out this week, but if it does I will update this review with a higher rating."
5,wen the plant arrived it was kinda small. but now it is starting to grow new traps and its getting bigger every day. i have enjoyed feeding it bugs and i an very satisfied with the product.
5,This review is based on 9GreenBox taking care of their customers.  If you receive an item that you consider to be subpar they will make it right.  Highly recommend this retailer.
1,I ordered this plant as a gift for a friend and was not told until recently that the plant had died shortly after she received it.  She said she followed care instruction but the leaves started to fall off and it wilted and died.  I wish I had known sooner but she just told me last week.
1,Two of the three plants were dying and are now dead. They all were tiny!!! They are suppose to catch flies but not one fly has been caught because they couldn't even fit in the bloom.  Rip Off!!! Do not do business with this vendor...
1,i recieved the fly trap and it seemed fine i put it in a nice sunny area it did good but then 2 days later it just died so i paid 15 bux for a plant that lived 3 days lol
4,"My son asked for this plant for his birthday and he is very happy with it.  It seems to be doing well thus far, hopefully it will continue to thrive.  It was packed well in the box and incurred no damage during shipping."
5,I love white polenta but most of what I find in the U.S. is very coarse.  It still tastes great but the texture leaves a lot to be desired.  Moretti Polenta Friulana Bianco is amazing - the creamiest and finest I have ever seen.
5,"Whipped peanut butter isn't for everyone; it's basically just peanut butter whipped up so it has more air in it.  For some reason, however, I LOVE it.  It spreads easier and seems to taste sweeter, lighter, and fluffier.  If you're a peanut butter freak, definitely give this stuff a try."
3,"On the label it says, ""1/3 less sugar"" than regular peanut butter.  If you read the fine print, it is because it 1/3 less peanut butter!  That being said, it is very tasty."
5,"There is no better sauce and I think it's even better than most homemade sauces. One can will make two large pizzas. It's seriously amazing. Unfortunately, it is hard to find but when I do find it... I buy all the stock. ;)"
5,I was looking all over for milk in a paint can and I found it! Thank you Amazon. The only down side is that it is the sweet milk from a goat's teat. Once one gets over that it is by far the best powdered milk in a paint can that I ever ordered online.
1,I was given a track number and told it was delivered to my POBOX.  It never happened.  I received a refund and am now in the process of wating for my new reorder.
5,"My three-year-old daughter has been drinking this brand of goat milk for the last 2 years because she is dairy intolerant.  This is a great product. Easy to carry (because it's a powder) and mix it when you need it.  And, this is an awesome price. $10.00 less than I usually pay for three cans."
5,we have been using this stuff for our baby for three years and she loves it.
5,"This is by far the best tasting thing that's come from a goat in years! Bullsburg Creamery, Man Chowder Dairy or Goat Coat can't hold a candle to this stuff. Drink it, bake it, snort it...it's all good."
3,"It's OK,but it is not as good as Meyenberg's fresh goatmilk in the carton.It sort of has a waters down taste.!"
5,"My one year old daughter drinks this every day and she loves it! I haven't accustomed myself to the ""gamey"" taste as other reviewers call it, but I'm thrilled that she is getting a whole fatted milk, free of hormones and overflowing with nutrition. Get 'em started early!"
5,my daughter is allergic to all dairy and cannot have all the extra iron they pump into the poisness formulas that they say are sooo healthy for your babies growth. this goats milk gives her all the nutrients that she needs. i would suggest to any mother even if the baby is not allergic to dairy.
5,"We started with fresh goats milk and after 2 weeks transitioned to this product.  I prepare it with warm water in the blender and add some strawberry flavoring.  My son (17 months) loves it.  Very easy to prepare, and compared to baby formula - VERY reasonable in price."
5,The flavor is very good. 45 seconds in the microwave and one measure of this milk and you are done (stir). I can noticed the difference between the whole milk from cow and this goat milk...it is much much better to digest.
5,"After shopping around, this is by far the best deal on powdered goat's milk."
5,This product is very easy to use and is good for people (and pets) that are lactose intolerant.  I use it as a treat for my ferrets and they love it!  It can help sick ferrets feel better and gain weight.  Thank you for offering something so easy to use!
2,Too bad this stuff in general ranks high on the inflammation triggering foods.  I'm trying to follow a low inflammation diet.  I do love the taste of goats milk.  It's very rich and creamy.  The liquid is better than the powder.
5,"El gastroenterologo pediatra recomendo este tipo de leche para mis hijos, ya que las demas formulas lacteas le causaban una alergia que les hacia vomitar."
5,Works well instead of formula or soy milk for my daughters bottle. Easy to mix as long as water is warmed. And she loves the taste! Plus much more affordable than buying goat milk cartons in the store.
4,"The kids like to drink, drinking a can of the fast.If the formula is better.and...But to shake to mix evenly."
5,The can looks just like the pic and it really helped my son with his constipation. I love it and he started drinking it with no problem at 2-3months old!!! Love it
5,"Now that my LO is exclusively formula fed, I use it once a day to supplement his feeds. He took to it after the first two feeds and now likes it very much. The only problem i had was with the powder- it doesn't blend well or instantly, but great product none the less"
5,we used to get this from our local grocery store for our 10month baby girl but it was $2 more a can and with prime there is no shipping charges as well as no taxes YAY!our baby loves this and it really has cut down on her spitting up.
5,"I use this for my twins and they love it, never had any problems. I just wish it were cheaper!"
5,I use goat milk for everything.  I use it to replace cow milk in all my recipes and for coffee and it works well for me.  The price is great!  Highly recommend it.
5,"Decent price...arrived on time.  No complaints here.  We will continue to purchase this item.<br />My daughter loves her ""goat milk"".  :)"
5,"I use this to make goat milk yogurt.  Very tasty.<br />Needs to be well stirred, but well worth the time."
5,My daughter is sensitive to cow's milk so we tried Goat milk and it works well. Amazon is the cheapest place to purchase this stuff! The powder sometimes has a hard time mixing with the water.  But not too bad.  Recommend to anyone needing a healthy alternative to cow's milk.
5,This is a really good source for goats milk. I found this online at Amazon and it is the least expensive price I've found. I order it regularly.
5,I am very pleased with my recent purchase of Meyeberg powdered goat milk.  I have shopped around locally and this is by far the best price per can I could find.  It was delivered as promised.
5,"We put this (in powdered form) on our dogs' food as a supplement (according to breeder instructions) with great results.  It sort of stinks, but the dogs love it and they're both better eaters with it than without."
5,Excellent service. Goat milk is delivered in premium condition.I will continue to order online. Thank you.
5,"My son is allergic to cow's milk, and this is a great nutritious alternative!  Plus, it's more like breastmilk."
5,"This is a great price, and easy way to purchase powdered goats milk.  The cheapest I've found, and the quickest shipping I've ever experienced from Amazon."
5,"We love this product. We've also got our little grandbaby hooked on it, when she comes to visit. She's now 2. We feel more comfortable with her drinking goat milk than cow's milk - much easier to digest. Love that Meyenberg.  Sometimes, though, we find better prices elsewhere on the Internet."
5,My baby is allergic to cow's milk and this is so much cheaper and better than the hypoallergenic formula.  He loves this stuff!
2,"Arrived in good condition, looks like well-made cans. Tastes nice, and I would love to use this product, but unfortunately, i got an allergic reaction from it."
5,"I love this product. It is so easy to make and it's done in minutes. It has a great flavor, and I love that there are so many packs because as soon as you finish one you want another."
5,Love this because 1. it is easy to make<br />  2. You get a good amount for your money!
3,"I love Jell-o No Bake Cheesecake but was disappointed the shelf life was so short. I got it after Christmas and the expiration date was April 8,2011.  Had I known that before I ordered I would have never ordered.  12 boxes is a lot to use up in only 3 months. I will not order again."
1,$136 for 12 boxes?<br /><br />Is this a rare item?<br /><br />That's $11.33 a box.<br /><br />I think the item might be a bit overpriced.
5,chrysanthemum tea taste great with lemons and Apriva. chrysanthemum tea is caffeine free that's great for pregnant women and those with high blood pressure.
5,Great on the go snack to take in the car for my 3 and 5 year old! NO MESSY HANDS like other snacks. Keeps the car much cleaner! :) Also great for me as a Weight Watcher snack with a wedge of Laughing Cow Lite Cheese! YUM!!!
3,"My husband says these pretzels are great and he loves them.  However, on the box I saw a warning that says the pretzels are made in a facility that produces peanut butter.  Therefore, I can't eat them.  So for those of you with peanut/nut allergy I would urge caution."
5,"They're not hard as a rock, or so soft that if you dip them, they'll break. For a diet pretzel, these are great (but then again, Snyders of Hanover has been at it for a long time)."
5,"As a motorcoach tour operator, I'm always looking for high-quality, reasonably priced snacks to offer to my customers on my trips.  Snyder's is a respected brand and I appreciate being able to purchase bulk quantities of their pretzels at such a great low price."
5,"This is a great deal for the amount of pretzel packs that are given. We love these since they're only 100 calories each and perfect for a snack, pair with a sandwich, or just to stick in your purse if you get hungry."
5,"Great buy but it seems that they are not very popular in my office (less healthy chip snacks are more popular) Still a great product, fresh and tastes like a pretzel should without any additives."
5,"I personally think these are the best pretzels on earth. I have to admit, that when it comes to eating pretzels, these are the first in my mouth."
5,"For coffee drinkers who buy Maxwell House coffee, this is a deal!  Buy two cases for just over $50!  Free shipping, too!  Seriously, you know I stocked up!"
5,"My husband is a big coffee drinker, and with a deal like this I can order ahead and never have to worry about running out. I hate to have to run to the store because I am out of one thing."
5,what can i say... great cookies. the only way to improve it is if it came with some cold milk.
5,"What's to say about Oreos?  The originals are still the best & I don't get them often because gluttony overcomes me.  One, two, or even a few isn't possible for me."
5,"I've tried many different cheeses, and I have to say Gorgonzola is my most favorite.<br /><br />The texture, aroma and flavor is both bold and pleasant yet not overbearing.<br /><br />A highly recommended cheese for novice cheese enthusiasts."
5,I love this mix. i use it  in several different recipes. Its moist and has a good consistency. The only problem is that  its difficult to find and I end up buying it on line!  Any suggestions???
5,I have been drinking V-8 juice for many years. Ordering it from Amazon by the case with free shipping(Prime) allows me to have it on hand in a convenient can with the right amount for my needs.
5,"He says it tastes great and is a great snack for his diabetes.  Good source of vitamins for him.  Great shipping, on our second order."
5,Great price and we did not have to leave the house and shop.  I really love the fact that there is no trouble with ordering.  Great product.
4,"Yes it is mainly a tomato juice and yes it has sodium in it, but it is definitely still better than drinking coke and its just a better alternative of drinks to bring to school or work =)"
5,tastes like v8 cuz it is v8 :o) ... delivered on time... my doctor says i dont get as much nutrition benefit as i thought i did because of the pasteurization process... but i dont eat lots of veggies and i like this stuff sooooo i drink it anyway...
5,Very meaty texture for a vegetarian product.  Looks like fresh ground beef after you mix it with water.  I would recommend this product.  I also want to try the sausage variety.
5,"I'm a meat eater, my wife's vegetarian.  She picked some of this veggie burger mix up to try, and we both really like it!  I'm not saying it tastes like beef, but I don't believe it's supposed to.  It's really good!  And I'd recommend it to anyone:)"
5,We just received a package of the hamburger mix from one of our dearest friends as a gift. We loved it. I am vegetarian and my husband is a meat eater. I whipped up some stuffed bell peppers using the mix and it was delicious. I love that it is a great price as well!
5,"good tea -- good for blood pressure. tastes good and smells good too.webvitamins good place to order from. fast and efficient, especially with amazon as the go-between."
2,I tried many teas and thought would try this kind. Saw it on Dr. OZ show. Didn't like its taste.
5,Tastes great.Does not need sugar.I am trying to see if my pressure goes down.I will update later J
1,I do not like sour taste and this has a sour kind of taste which i don't like. The smell isn't that great either
5,Great tasting tea and very healthy.  I was very surprised and will probably be ordering more.  It does cost - but the cheapest I have found.
5,"This is good tasting tea, no need for sugar....I am drinking one cup per day usually at mid- day for blood pressure...........I am not sure how long it takes to help lower BP but if it helps even a little it's worth drinking especially since its very tasty........"
5,"I love to make sun tea with these tea bags, it is very nice on a hot day to sit with a chilled glass. It is tasty and not too sweet, highly recommended!"
5,"I am not a fan of green teas, but I really love this one.  It has a nice ""non-tea"" taste.  It's hard to find in stores so I got the 6 pack.  Great price and shipped really fast."
4,This makes great iced tea. More flavor than regular tea. Refreshing. Recommend it. Hard to find in stores. Get it here.
5,"I have always enjoyed this particular tea, plain and simple.  A great green tea with a hint of ginseng and honey!  I buy it on Amazon because I can't find it in my area, so it's worth it!"
5,This product was difficult to find in stores but easy to find through Amazon.  I will order items by this method again.
1,"i got this in the mail nice packaging and all opened it up to see its single serving bags 3oz of hot water to a bag ...not gallon size =( so i decided to make some and it tasted like the little pink bubble gum ""double bubble"" i used to get as a kid yuck so not what i was expecting..."
1,"Tasteless, basically says it all.  I love tea.  Drink it every day.  I found this undrinkable.  Great packaging, but not a good tea for me."
3,"I like the taste, but the store does not always has this.  Some-how it tastes different from the one in the store, much weaker caffeine and aroma..."
5,I have had possibly every energy drink and this one is possibly the best. Great energy and no crash. Mixes well with everything and my friends love it. Will buy again!
2,"I didn't order because it doesn't indicate anywhere what size the bottle is, I think that's basic information, maybe you should include that in your description"
5,I ushally get this curry cat. at the store but they stopped carring it.  It helps me remember the tast of some foods from Germany.  I will shop here again when I need some more.
5,"I went to a gourmet store and asked for their ""Chocolate Expert"" to recommend a chocolate among the high-end makers.  He pointed out this brand, which was affordable as well as incredibly flavorful.  If you need a chocolate to melt in your mouth, savor the Santander 53% cocoa."
5,"This 53% percent cocoa semi-dark chocolate bar is the perfect choice for people who dont usually like dark chocolate.  Tasting nothing at all likke common dark chocolates like Hershey's (yuck), Santander's quality is excellent.  I highly recommend this and all other Santander chocaltes."
5,You will not find better tasting soup anywhere.  I initially purchased it because my wife is sensitive to MSG and other kinds of additives that are found in most soups.  After eating some myself I now keep a supply on hand for all of the family.
1,This soup has no flavor. Broth had a slimy consistency instead of a liquid-y one. I was so disappointed.
5,"I normally HATE canned soup but this one is an exception!  Great flavor and the chicken, carrots and rice actually seem 'real' - not imitation or over-processed like all the other canned soups I've tried."
5,"Delicious, organic, full of flavor and a hit at our house! Plump rice, fat carrots, tasty chicken - a great soup!"
5,I love rice and this was good with all kinds of textures! I am allergic to so many things but this soup was awesome and no hives! Win WIN!
1,I can get this at my local grocery store for $2.69 per can ($32.28 for 12).
5,It's my favorite soup.  And you can't beat the amazon price with free shipping.  Thanks for making my favorites available.
4,"I love having a soup that is healthy and not full of bad ingredients.  I like the chicken noodle better, but the rice is pretty good too."
5,This soup is simply the best.  Been ordering for a very long time and will continue to do so.<br />Great soup and product.
2,"This soup is just offensive.  Why does it taste like cinnamon?  Also, it's twice the price of Campbell's and 1/4 the chicken.  Sure, it says it's organic.  I totally believe that, don't you?"
4,"The soup itself was excellent -- a nice, well-tasting mix of meat, veggies and wild and white rices, but surely a few more chunks of chicken could have been added. I bought it at local grocer -- two cans for $4."
5,Very good WHITE CHOCOLATE and Very Fresh too! Ty! Thank you for wrapping securely. Quick shipment was appreciated very much!
1,"I found this exact same product, same size at our local grocery store (QFC and Safeway) for $2.99. So, am not sure why this product is priced so much higher."
1,"$5.00 over the local grocer's regular price. I expected a fair market price when I placed this order, but because I didn't research it I was extremely disappointed to find it so inflated. Live and learn, I hope I can save someone else the trouble of having to make a return."
5,"First quality, dogs like it and it does not have grain as an ingredient, therefore a reduction in ear infections due to yeast infections."
5,"My dogs love this food and with the limited ingredients and low allergins, it makes it great for them as well."
5,"These are such high quality beans, no stones, great taste, cook, and freeze and thaw perfectly! I will order again and again!"
5,That all that need to be said. The best chocolate candy with the best service. And add a great price and it just can not be beat. The item arrived on time and in good shape like most items ordered through amazon.
5,"What I like about these is that they are gluten free, full of flavor and have a hearty corn flavor. They are a bit thicker than some of the chips I've tried out there and hold the salsa!  Love these!"
5,I love the crunch & taste of the corn strips. My whole family loves them too!
5,"This is a mild, buttery scented cheese. My favorite cheese made in the United States."
5,"My son is 7 months old and this has always been his favorite baby food - it is nice a thick, which he loves!"
2,"Purchased two liters... looking for an oil to put in salads, on bread, etc... something with a strong flavor of olive oil... this is NOT it.  This is good for cooking... has little flavor."
5,I mix 2 scoops of this and two scoops of formula in my son's bottle and it keeps him full longer. My mother says she used it on me when I was a child and it kept my cheeks rosy and me full. My son seems to really enjoy it.
5,This the best flavor out of all the others my daugther loves it and it is easy to make and very nutritional too.
5,"sweet tasty but there is not sugar ,baby love it.Better than gerber.Like  Mellin ,Milupa or Plasmon brand."
4,"This is a great product. My son loves it. Still, I like better the ""8 cereal with honey"" that somehow is not available in the US but you can find it in Europe."
5,"Perfect starter tree. It is adorable and the included manual tells you the basics of bonsai. I bought this for my mother-in-law for Mother's Day, a live tree instead of cut flowers makes a great gift."
2,"The tree is nice, but that is the only part besides the pot.  Did NOT come with a matching drip tray, as promised.  Instructions were lacking information and were merely a printed piece of paper."
3,"The product was fair, not as ""country"" as I would like, but better than you find in a grocery store."
5,Both my friend and I love this product. The dark chocolate and the mint really supplement each other. A little expensive but excellent quality.
5,"My mother and father were the recipient of these wonderful pieces of chocolate heaven.  They didn't believe they deserved receiving these, but I know they did deserve to receive these!"
5,Good taste...mixes easy and has no artifical sweetners.  I been using this one for years
5,"If you are concerned about digesting dairy and soy products you can rest assured that this is the protein for you. It's a nice vanilla flavor with no chalkiness and no artificial sweeteners. I love it and I know my body loves it. NO digestion problems, ever. Rock on."
5,"In general, egg protein doesn't have the best taste.  Since it has a mild flavor, mixing with other ingredients (e.g. bananas) work well."
5,"I loved vitalabs egg protein, but I think their out of business.  This healthy n fit will substitute just fine,"
5,"Excellent Product. Great taste and easy to sue in cereal, yougur etc..  That's it in a nutshell.  Very Timely delivery."
3,"Although it is very high in protein, I thought the vanilla ice cream flavor was very bland. I would not buy this again as it was not tasty enough."
1,"The protein powder is ok, not to good as i expected. if you pour hot milk over it will will form substance like egg white, which is very bad in taste, not at all drinkable."
5,"Grandpa Po's Originals Slightly Spicy is a wonderful savory organic snack. Not too spicy at first and ends with a great finish. If I had to sum it up in one word it would be ""WOW!""I would recommend them for young and old alike."
5,hot full of lavor great for jerky sauces love it
5,The product was better than expected and it arrived quickly. I am very pleased with this purchase.
5,I just received my tea..  Thanks for getting it out so quick.. I really appreciate the extra box..  I drink this tea every night..<br /><br />Julianne
5,"I have used this product for over twenty years.  However, it is<br /><br />no longer available in any of the local food markets in the<br /><br />Los Angeles, CA area.  I'm happy that I can order it via<br /><br />Amazon.com"
4,I ordered this candy for a friend as a mother's day gift.  She was delighted to receive it and I was excited to share it. :-)
4,This is not as tall as they advertised. But we kept it and we like it alot. It is the shining star of our indoor Bonsai collection. Just stunning. Like having a forest in your kitchen! We've had it about 6 months now and it's thriving.
2,"Pan Ducale Almond Biscotti were a  disappointment to me, not because they were bad, but because they could not come close to the great Lettieri Prato Belli Cantuccini Almond Cookies.  At best they are low in calories - also in almonds."
5,They have other flavors but the dogs favorite is still the original. I wish they carried it in the local petstore we go to purchase their other flavors!
5,"We love this sauce and are hunting around to find it and to introduce it to others. Sort of a wasabi mayonnaise--and terrific on fish, potatoes, and many other things (we're eager to discover more)."
5,"Was quite pleased with the product. Arrived on time and wrapped well. Would buy again and again !!!!!  Try it, you'll let it !!!!!"
4,"The service was excellent, and the patty shells were delicious.  It's hard to find those things in grocery stores or bakeries, and being able to order them on line is a real help."
5,"I was absolutely amazed at how good this is.  In my opinion, it is as good as fresh ground coffee beans brewed up.  While I only use when I'm in a hurry, or want one cup, I would not be without it.  (And I have NEVER USED INSTANT before now."
4,I use it when traveling or when I'm in a hurry and don't have the time to grind my beans. I was surprised by how much it tastes like drip.
5,I love this coffee.  It is easy to prepare one cup when you are wanting a great cup of coffee.  Highly recommend - I usually use one-half of the package since I don't like my coffee real strong.
5,"I like this coffee.  It's much better than instant.  I keep some packs in my desk for those long afternoons and I also started carrying them when I go camping.  If I can go wthout another cup of instant coffee from a jar, I'll be happy."
5,"This is a great stand-in when you can't make it out to Starbucks.  Love having an instant version at home.  Love, love, love it."
4,"If you want a good cup of coffee and are rushed for time or your household is like mine and you are the only coffee drinker, then you must give this a try. I admit the price is a little high but for that occasional cup it is well worth it. No bitter after taste like other instants"
5,I tried the Starbucks Instant coffee.. Not only does it taste like coffee.. but there is no after taste like you get with other instant coffees. I give this 2 thumbs up!!!!
5,Starbucks has once again proven it is the world's best coffee company. Their new VIA instant coffee packets taste great and are portable which gets me through the day. I highly recommend this to anyone who loves Starbuck's coffee!!
5,"I drink Starbucks drip coffee. The instant tastes just as good, and is great when you don't want to make a whole pot. Friends could not believe they were drinking instant coffee."
5,"Without reservation, this is the best instant coffee I have ever tasted. I have consumed coffee in many different countries during over 40 years of travel. Starbucks has created a masterpiece with this product. It is a bit expensive, but well worth the cost."
4,"After a slow start at our meeting of guests embracing these coffee packets, everyone ended up enjoying them."
5,"Really very good. Taste is great, no weird artificial taste, no little bitty grounds floating about. This is not crunchy brown water, but an actual cup of coffee. I make it in the microwave and it's great. Get the 10 pack for 9.95 and it's less than $1/cup."
5,"Great coffee for the one cup drinker, or the traveler. Especially great for travel where you have to pack it in your suit cases. Wonderful for overseas where US style coffees are hard to be found. Taste is very good."
3,Coffee is good but I don't care for individual pacs. Would rather have coffee in bags like their other coffee is packed.
5,"Sell me more! These things are the perfect breakfast. No, they are just perfect. Better price then the local grocery store and better selection."
5,"Sometimes I just want something hot for breakfast, but don't want to cook anything. This oatmeal pack is great and has my favorite flavors.<br /><br />Recommend it with milk. With water is just too weak."
5,All of these flavors are great and make for a filling and delicious breakfast. I highly recommend purchasing this item!
5,This is definitely a great snack or morning breakfast<br /><br />I tried all the flavors and they were as expected....great<br /><br />if you want a good healthier snack or meal this is the way to go!!!
5,"Can't find this product anywhere locally - thanks Amazon!  Much cheaper than 4 boxes of Quaker Oatmeal anywhere, and these flavors are the best :)"
5,"This particular variety box contains 3 of my very favorite types of instant oatmeal:  Apple Crisp, Cinnamon Roll & Banana Bread."
5,"This is a great marinade for any kind of meat. I use it also in stir-fry or fried rice receipes.<a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B004TGWCBQ"">Garlic Sesame Marinade & Glaze Sauce</a>"
5,"I had this cheese during the summer on a hiking trip through the French Alps.  We were able to go to a small producer and watch its preparation.  It is really delicious, better than Gruyere, to which it is often compared. When oh when can I get it in the U.S?"
5,"WE LOVE JAMAICAN ME CRAZY coffee!!! It's smooth and rich with a hint of vanilla and caramel.  This is whole bean, so you do have to have a coffee grinder, but totally worth it!"
5,"this stuff really works, i love it and cant get enough.  It tastes amazing  Highly recommend trying it, you wont be disappointed!!"
5,"I don't drink soda and have no interest in energy drinks - I love coffee. However, I enjoy chamomile tea before bed. This calming beverage is a great alternative to tea - especially in hot weather. I will be ordering more - wish it were available locally."
5,"I was skeptical at first, but not anymore, did it's job and I slept like a baby.  Great taste and product works wonders, very relaxing"
5,"I love Koma. It tastes great, it works, and the sugar-free version tastes exactly like the original (to me). I just ordered my third case."
5,I was at a Walmart in South Carolina and just picked some up. I was traveling and it helped me unwind.
5,Bought a case to see what it was about.  I am a night owl which effects my day-to-day performance and father-related tasks.  After a can I do feel mellow and finding myself going to bed much earlier.
5,"After 20-30 minutes you do feel alot more relaxed, reminded my of smoking a certain item when I was younger. Tastes great to boot!"
5,Purchased this tea because of recommendation. Product arrived well packaged and quickly. I am very pleased with this product and will purchase it again.
4,I have tried this product before and I really love it. The price is fair and I enjoy it...
4,The tea is good and fresh. We enjoy it. The shipping is fast and cost is reasonable.<br />I recommend this product.
5,You get enough in each package to make a good size cup of drink.  It is consistent in its flavor and the amount you get in each packet.  I have purchased it a couple of times.
4,If you don't have the time to cut up ginger and boil it for it's wonderful flavor here's an alternative.  This tea is refreshing.  True ginger flavor and punch is wonderful.
5,"My dughter used these, and loved the fresh taste of the tomatoes!  Said it was like she had just picked them fron a garden!"
5,"We love this vegetable pouch for our 18 month old, and more importantly she likes it too. I like that it has sort of a dry texture compared to basic blended vegetables. I stir a touch of milk into it each time and it makes it really creamy. She always finishes it, and its one of our favorites."
2,My 9 1/2 month old would mush this around in her mouth and not swallow it.  There isnt much she doesnt like but she sure doesnt like this stuff.  It looks like a weird mushy green stuff.  I am sure it is super healthy but she didnt like it at all.
1,Sent this to my mother to help her out with groceries since she is on a fixed income. She said it was horrible and would be throwing the other 2 boxes out. So I would not reccomend this product.
5,"Have roasted and peeled chestnuts all my life. Since I have less time and energy now, I ordered these in a jar already peeled. Tried lots of different ones and found these to be the most tasteful and clean and fresh."
5,Butterfinger crips is so good its like eating a really fresh butterfinger. I order online because I had a hard time finding them in the stores. If you like butterfingers you will like butterfinger crisp. A light candybar not to heavy on your stomach.
5,"All of my 3 girls - from the black lab, akita, and pomeranian love these treats. I love them because I can disguise any of the dogs meds in them, and they will still eat it!! Great."
5,"Lean Treats for big dogs is a great product and Goldie Loves them, and yes this was the best price and it was shipped on time... Tom (12)"
5,My dog absolutely loves these treats! He's a very picky eater and this is the only treat he will eat.  The fact that they are pretty healthy makes me very happy.
4,"Wellness Pure Delights are very tasty, moist and healthy that most of our finicky cats seem to enjoy. Definitely will buy more in the future."
3,"I have 4 cats, and none of them really like these treats. They will eat them eventually, but the certainly don't go wild for them. I do like that grain and chicken free, so they are good for cats with allergies."
5,"My cat absolutely loves these things. The only downside to them is that they will dry out after a while. Other than that, they're great healthy cat snacks."
5,"The ingredients are good and my cat loves it. She's never walked away from it, so I was very surprised when my son's cats did. I decided to rate it from my cat's point of view."
3,This product is really a hit or miss. My cat does not seem to go crazy over these treats....Sometimes he does not eat these right away.
5,"Great natural treat for my cat, whose health I want to keep strong for many years. And he loves them!!!"
5,"My cat seems to really like these.  As one reviewer said, they will dry out if the bag isn't sealed.  I haven't had any problems with sealing the bag that I purchased."
4,"I like the busy bones.  My pit has to work at it a bit harder than she does some of other ""large"" bones on the market.  I do wish it would last a little longer.  She can finish one in under 5 minutes.  I'm giving it to her because I want her to be BUSY.  Not distracted for 5 minutes."
4,I buy this as a special treat. It lasts about an hour and my large dog really enjoys it.
5,"These bones are pricey but my German Shepard loves them. Because the bones are so dense and heavy they take a lot longer to devour, hence the name, Busy Bone."
5,"Our German Short Haired Pointer goes crazy for these bones.  They are big, tough and it takes our 100 pound dog a good hour to chew through this!"
5,"This quality product is my dogs favorite healthy chew treat.  They enjoy the Purina Busy Bone, immensely.  They prefer this treat to rawhide chews and do not quit on the Purina Busy Bone until it is finished."
2,"Overpriced beans, they are packed in a glass tube that is not air tight.<br /><br />The beans were thin and almost dry.<br /><br />Get the cheaper options at amazon instead, they are much better and way cheaper..."
5,"Very tasty, I used it for years, they recently added more red peppers and that's makes it more spicy that I prefer, but it still very good."
5,"We were unable to find this in any of our supermarkets since April. Finally decided to order it. Service was fast and product was what we were looking for. For any of you who have never tried this, it makes mongolian beef better than any chinese restaurant."
5,"This product is excellent.  Tried it one night for a quick, easy dinner and the whole family loved it, including my very fussy 19 year old daughter!  Well worth trying for yourself."
5,This seasoning is easy to use and delicious.  I recommend you add some sliced mushrooms too.  It's a great addition.  Served with brown rice and broccoli - it's a favorite at our house!
5,"I love this seasoning and actually bought it on amazon after searching everywhere to find it after the store i use to buy it from closed.  I use this seasoning with chicken, too."
5,I bought this once at my local grocer and it was so good I went back to get more and it was gone.  I asked the store to get it again and they never did so found it at Amazon.  Placing my second order today since I am down to my last pack.
5,"This is a simple and delicious. I have made this several times, just add beef and spring onions. It is really delicious, tastes almost like the Mongolian Beef we order from PF Changs China Bistro.  One of my favorites and so easy too."
5,When I lived in Germany I bought this all the time over there. The biggest problem was of course everything was written in German. Since you have a computer just go to a translation website and scan in the instructions and have them changed to English. From there you can use the product.
2,"I would we willing to try this product, and have six envelopes in my cupboard, but unfortunately the instructions are in German.  Maybe I can hire an interpreter??"
5,I now know why so many people recommended this brand. The quality is amazing and you can tell the difference in substance compared to other dog foods. Even the organic type.
5,"Puppy loves the food.  Never has digestive issues.  Love the 16 lb bag, so I only have to buy one per month."
5,"The fat free La Bandarita flour tortillas are great when I can find them.<br />Wal-mart is supposed to carry them in my local stores, but they don't.<br />So I turned to Amazon, and now they don't have them either!"
5,"One of the best mass produced teas I have tried. Light Keemun flavour, delicious with or without milk and can sit in the pot without tasting stewed. A great bargain in the 6 pack."
5,"I had tried this tea in bags before.  I prefer leaf tea.  When the local shop ran out of Irish Breakfast tea, I tried this instead.  Very good flavor that recalls UK trips.  I would recommend this tea to anyone."
5,"A delicious strong black tea with enough flavor to stand up to milk and sugar. Might take some getting used to if you don't usually drink black tea, but for the aficionado it's one of the best."
3,"As a fan of English & Irish breakfast teas, I found this tea to be very weak flavored.  If you like milder/weaker teas, this may be for you.  But if you like more robust flavors, steer clear of this one."
5,"This is my new favorite tea. It is absolutely delicious and even after it's sat and gotten cold, it's good. I'm not a fan of milk in my tea but I'll drink this without sugar, no problem. It has a naturally creamy flavor. Fantastic tea."
5,They were shipped in ICE. That's pretty cool. They arrived in the summer Texas heat without even the slightest hint of melting.
5,My wife is very fond of chocolate covered cherries and has tried just about every brand.  She assures me that these are the very best she's ever eaten.
5,My dog loves greenies and didn't notice the switch from the regular to the lite.  She loves them either way!
5,"This product is very healthy for your body, it is cost effective because is not mixed with other things, it comes with a little spoon with the right measurement for your drinks. I bought it in Peru, and I want to find it in the US.  Is better than other stevia products I have bought in the past."
5,Taste is much superior to the regular freeze dried that you get in the supermarket.  I would bet you will enjoy the taste as much as we do.
5,"I love cherry soda, but this product is the best cherry soda  that I have ever tasted.  Sweet and slightly tart at one and the same time.  Try it once, and you will be hooked for good."
5,"In the winter when fresh blueberries exceed our food budget these dried blue berries are fine for muffins, breads and puddings.<p>  We also enjoy fruit on our cereal.  In the winter it is often oatmeal and we sprinkle these blueberries on a bowl of oatmeal - wonderful on a cold morning."
5,"These are delicious,with just the right touch of mustard and a nice crunch.I would definitely consider buying them again.The bags are generously filled,too."
5,Five Gum is a new product from Wrigley's. I'm always on the lookout for new gum since I like having something to chew while I'm driving. I came across this back in august and was pleasantly surprised. The flavor lasts a really long time and is relatively strong.
5,"Light, sweet and oh so good is how I would describe this tea. I first had it at a hotel at the complimentary breakfast and loved it so much, I went to Amazon and ordered more that same day."
5,"This Passion tea is used at Starbucks. We mix it with two Lipton tea bags for iced tea. Really good, fruity flavor. Great for summer!"
5,The vendor is fast and dependable. The tea is simply the best way to relax and great tasting too. Highly recommend !!
5,This tea is amazing. I drink it iced with sugar and lime. It will blow your mind. The taste is similar to a flavor of kool-aid that I had as a child. I can just drink glass after glass of this tea.
5,I had a difficult time trying to find aluminum free baking soda and finally found it on Amazon.  It was shipped quickly and the seller put in several free samples of natural beverage mixes. (which I really appreciated and will use) Very pleased with this product.
5,"I was real happy to find this. No stores in my area carry it, nor does my health food store. I feel better knowing this is aluminum free. I basically use it to maintain a ph of around 7. Works perfect."
5,"Aluminum-free baking soda is something every IC sufferer should have on hand in case of flare-ups. This baking soda is just as effective as regular baking soda, but without the toxic aluminum. Highly, highly recommend. Super fast shipping, too, great seller!"
4,I have been using this product to increase my PH score after a bout of TA State 1 Bladder cancer.  There is no aftertaste and it leaves me with a clean feeling.  Delivery from Amazon's vendor in Kentucky was slow.
4,"Working to reduce m my body'd PH, helping to reduce the effects of my psoriasis, using twice a day first in the morning, last at night, mixing with a half a lemon and 10 oz of filtered water, seems to be helping"
5,I really like Bob's Red Mill products. This item came promptly and is perfect for my baking needs. I totally recommend it!
5,"All I can say, is that it give me peace of mind, knowing that I am not ingesting aluminum!<br />Can't tell any difference...same taste as the regular Arm & Hammer."
3,"Great product and nice taste, glad they sell it online, not sure where to buy it in the local supermarket, it was a decent price, $2.11, I just thought that the shipping fee of $4.99 seemed high, but the product seems great!"
5,Real salt is good and good for you. Doesnt take much to flavor foods with this product. Try it for yourself today...
3,"Purchased three pounds.  Arrived well packaged.  Am trying to find a replacement roaster of this blend.  This is good, but not great...we'll keep on looking."
5,"This is the best coffee I've ever tasted, and at a reasonable price. Outstanding Coffee ! Thanks, Coffee Bean Direct."
5,This coffee has a taste so good and so distinctive. Great aftertaste and low acid are welcome additions to it. The best I have ever bought on Amazon
5,"These beans are my favorite for making espresso.  I get the most amazing crema from them, especially when I grind them frozen and store them in the freezer.  We have tried quite a few different kinds of beans, but we stopped looking after we found this one.  Using a Baby Gaggia espresso machine."
3,"The coffee was not stale as some have had, but the roast is too dark for a bean such as this.  I believe a better product could be had with the same beans."
3,"We had found some other peaberry coffee previously which had a really interesting, rich flavor to us.  For some reason, this brand just tasted flat to us by comparison.  The search for the perfect peaberry coffee continues..."
4,"This is a good tea that has a nice flavor. My only complaint is that for a rich tea, you have to use extra tea bags. This is sold in bulk which helps off set the price for using more tea bags."
5,"A pack of 18 on any of Horizon's flavors, cost about $15.00 this is RIDICULOUSLY EXPENSIVE!! But the product itself is EXCELLENT!!"
5,I love milk & only organic milk & Horizon is my favorite & these little cartons are great for on the go if not opened can be does not spoil long as not opened great for on the go & packing for a trip
5,"I bought this for a trip and it was so wonderful that I'm planning to buy more. It's a good way to keep your kids well fed with good quality organic milk, even if you are not home."
5,I still like cherry the best but the blue zotz are good. The turn your tounge blue so watch out for that.
5,"I love this product. Tazo has produced a mild, yet sweet and spicy tea that I can only call magic. Sweet Cinnamon Spice has a flavor all on it's own, and I highly recommend it for adventurous spice tea drinkers looking for that perfect balance."
5,"Delicious, flavorful tea.  A must for cinnamon lovers.  It also has a pleasant sweetness that even those of us who don't use sweeteners can enjoy. Wonderful as a hot drink, but I especially like it as a cold drink."
5,I love this tea and I hate that it is so hard to find! I am so glad it is available on Amazon!
5,I tried this first in a sampler pack and was immediately hooked. I put a bit of sugar and honey in it and at that point its basically like drinking a cinnamon roll.
2,"Wow, very weird taste.  I typically like all the ingredients, but this mix just tastes wrong.  It's somewhat similar to sarsaparilla tea, but with a licorice aftertaste.  It isn't so bad that I couldn't finish the first cup, but not my cup of tea."
5,Our small family member loves these slivers every morning. He sits and waits to get one. These are just the right size for him. Thank you for giving us a great produce. Will order again.
5,"I ordered it 2 times and never had a problem like the reviewer above and I gonna compare it with my fav brand"" Crown Prince"" later then i 'll order it again . Delicious for making ""A TROPICAL FISH SOUP"" and more."
1,"I purchased this product to lure black bear to the bait pile. The product has no sweet smell as one would expect. I have asked for a refund or exchange from the supplier, no response."
5,Ordered these seeds for a recipe that I got from my grandmother. Seeds came very quickly and well packaged. Much cheaper than buying all those small bottles at the grocery store. Would definatly use this company again.
5,I love this stuff.  My dad brought some home from his home town in New York.  Love it.  Great marinade.  We skewer beef or moose cubes after letting them sit in marinade.  Love it!
5,"This energy drink has worked for me. I drink one in the morning for my drive to work, and one before I work out at night. Grape is OK, fruit punch is better."
5,Our cats just love this stuff.  They eat the Ultra Premium dry food and Ocean Fish canned food.  We've given them some of the other formulas and they'd slowly eat them but they won't leave the Ocean Fish alone.
5,Very Healthy ingredients..compared to store brands..My<br />cats love this..they are Fussy Eaters..so I think many<br />cats would love this food..Will Buy it again.
4,"Tried this for the first time last night and really liked it , it had a great taste . Good for when you want something but do not want to ruin your diet . bought them in the grocer for 7.99 . I thought that was expensive ..Hopefully i can find them cheaper elsewhere"
5,"Silken tofu is so versatile: creamy salad dressing, sauce, etc.  So glad I purchased it at Amazon.  The price was excellent, packing fine and delivery quick."
5,Morinu Soft Tofu makes the best puddings. I also make vegan mayonaise and salad dressings with it. Works out great.
5,I love silken tofu and use it a lot to make smoothies for myself and my toddlers. This is good-quality silken tofu and I was happy with the price and convenience of having it delivered to my door. (It's hard to find in grocery stores around here!)
4,The quality of Tofu is very good. But it is a little bit more soft than what I expected. I will try the firm version.
5,"This tofu is so silky, my smoothie is the smoothest with this tofu!!  I also like that I can store the extra tofu in the cupboard until I open the package."
5,I was really glad to find this tofu on Amazon. I eat tofu on a daily basis and this is one of the best there is. I will definitely be buying on a regular basis.
5,"I have been looking for Morinu Soft Tofu, Silken. I was happy when I found that Amazon.com had it. I still don't know if I like it as well as the Firm. I have to try it a little longer."
3,When I read the description of this it said mini - these are regular size.  Tastes great but my 86 year old mom wants the mini ones and I have not been able to find the smaller dine size ones.
5,the product was exactly what was described.our dog loves these treats and is given them daily.we will be reordering in no time..thank you
1,"I got sent the wrong item, which happens i know.  I tried to contact the company multiple times with no response.  I finally had to contact amazon and they are returning the item for me..."
1,"Both of my cats (age 11) threw up for an extended period after eating just 3 of these. Into the trash they go (not the cats, the treats). Not sure what they were reacting to but thought it would be good to let other cat parents know the risk."
1,My sweet little Persian looks like she is dying. She's been puking all night because of these treats. How has this item not been recalled?
1,"I've tried it with both my cats, several times. Every time they eat this, and other Whiskas Temptations products, they vomit within minutes.<br />They LOVE it, they WANT it, it's CHEAP but it makes them puke, so, I'd consider this a bad purchase."
5,"Not only kept her clear, she put much needed weight on after diagnosed with a chronic illness she has beaten. I've read some of the other reviews. As a former Vet Technician I do ask, if your cat is vomiting please see your vet asap. Hairballs that are very bad can kill a cat."
4,"Not exactly sure whether it really mediate hairball issue because my short hair Russian Blue rarely vomits while my mixed medium hair toby vomits quite frequently, regardless of the treat. Nevertheless, my cats do love it greatly, always rushing to me whenever I grab it."
1,"I have fed my 2 cats these treats the last 2 days.  Within 5 minutes of eating them, they are both throwing up.  I will be going back to the Three Dog Bakery Treats.  Expensive but have never made my cats sick.  Why is the company not responding to so many bad reviews?"
5,"I received my cat's treats quickly and the product works very well. The best part is that the cats love it, so I don't have to force them to take their cure for hairballs!"
5,"Just like the other reviewer, my cat wants to eat these instead of his actual meals! LOL He's truly addicted. I am glad they have this formula with the hairball control, they have helped out so much and he rarely gets them anymore!"
4,Bought it first at Costco but they recently stopped stocking it. My daughter loves dipping her carrots in this dressing instead of ranch dressing.  Also great for salads.
5,I like to baste this heavily over pork roast and serve extra on the side.  My family LOVES it!
5,"Not sure what anyone else uses this sauce for, but we use it with our roast beef sandwiches and it's amazingly good. Also, I use it for my roasted vegetables or roasted potatoes. It's delicious as a coating with garlic powder, rice flour, and pepper. It is sweet, but not sickeningly so. We love it!"
5,"Excellent product. I use it almost every night. Used to be available through Costco, but they no longer handle it.<br />I would recommend it to anyone."
5,"Vidalia Onion dressing is one of my favorite salad dressings, and Oak Hill Farms beats the other brands hands down! A great flavor, and popular with my dinner guests. I highly recommend it!"
5,"I used this Vidalia onion sauce as a BBQ kebob marinade. Try it by mixing it with 2 cubed pork necks, 2 medium onions (half rings) and 4-6oz of this onion sauce. Mix everything (pork neck cubes, onions and onion sauce) in the mixing bowl and leave it in covered in the fridge for 12 hours."
5,"We used to buy this item at Costo Warehouse, but they quit carrying it.<br />We really like Vidalia Onion  Vinaigreet and therefore looked for a place to buy it.<br />Thanks great product."
5,Can't find this or anything like it in our stores anymore.  Good to know I can get it on here.
5,"This will be great with all that I use it for<br /> Thanks, Linda"
5,"healthy, delicious, and great for food allergies! no soy, corn etc. Only contains wheat, safflower oil, and salt."
5,It's very delicious and I love salty foods .. But I wish that contains olive oil instead of safflower oil :(
5,"Back to Nature Harvest Whole Wheats Crackers, 8.5-Ounce Boxes (Pack of 12) - My wife's all-time favorite crackers - only sporadically available at Acme supermarkets and perfectly delivered by the case by Amazon."
5,"Excellent choice for a high fiber cracker.  These taste great and like other Back to Nature items, don't have all the undesirable ingredients you'd like to avoid if necessary. Whole wheat, safflower oil, salt and Vitamin E -- perfect."
5,"Very closely resembles a Triscuit cracker...except there is no soy!  (And a bit lighter.)<br /><br />You will not be disappointed with the taste and texture, it is a quality cracker.<br /><br />Enjoy."
5,"I love them.  My kids and I eat them a box at a time.  We have replaced chips (and other ""bad for you"" snacks) with these.  Just wish they were organic."
1,Does anyone realize tocopherol usually comes from soy? I'm still hunting for a cracker I don't have to make. Their website is unclear about it's source.
3,"I WAS VERY EXCITED TO GET THIS THEN I HAD A CUP, I NEVER MADE IT THRU THE CUP...<br />IT IS SO SWEET IT IS SICKENING REALLY, NOW I HAVE TO FIND FAMILY TO PAWN THIS STUFF ONTO<br />AND CHRISTMAS IS A LONG WAY OFF...LOL"
5,"My son has nut allergies and US made are not safe for him since early childhood...now 19...The British...Nestle Co. have made a treat for him...thrilled to have his favorite and in DARK, great...and quick service and delivery!"
5,"My cats love the food, and it's on the HAPPY list of ""Companies that Don't Test on Animals"" linked through the PETA site, peta.org.  That is VERY reassuring."
3,"I really wanted this food to work, as it seems to have good ingredients for a decent price.  However, my cats, who are typically ravenous little mongrels, don't even bother to check it out when offered.  So much for saving a couple of bucks--now they eat Organix."
5,I have found this cat food to be the purrfect choice for both my cat with IBD and my cat with Diabetes. Howard and Miss C are thriving on this diet of Turkey and brown rice and  enjoy it so much more than prescription diets. The price was great too for a premium cat food.
5,My cats love this food. They always lick every last morsel of it. I love it too because it is one of the best values for a high-quality canned food.
5,"I have three cats... have had cats for years, this food smells better than most, my cats like it, the ingredients appear to be better than the average cat food. So far, so good! i'll continue to use it for my cats"
1,Used for less then 2 months both cats fur began falling out bad.<br />Stopped using it & the cats fur is back to fine.<br />Back to feeding my cats Nature's Variety instinct.<br />I baught this PetGaurd product at Fairway Market not Amazon.<br />Will not use it again.
5,"i'm giving this a solid 5, because my old but healthy cat loves this stuff and it's wicked good for him, but i'll tell you right now that this stuff looks and smells quite gross; as long as i don't have to eat it, it's all good."
5,"What can I say? It's cat food but without stuff in it cats shouldn't be eating. It is her favorite flavor, but that depends on the cat."
5,"My cats love the food, and it's referenced on the list of ""Companies that Don't Test on Animals"" through the PETA web site."
2,"I felt really good about being a good cat mommy and buying something of such quality for my sweeties... Too bad none of the would eat it, no matter what I did.<br /><br />Donated it to the local SPCA -- maybe a dog will eat it."
1,I used to order this product at 25 per box of 12 cans and now it turned into 50 dollars??? how did it double out of nowhere??
5,We always drink Timmothy's or Emeril's. Thought we would try something different. Not too many decafs to choose from. We were pleasantly surprised that this had a great taste with a full bodied flavor. I like my coffee on the milder side so I can even get 2 cups from 1 Kcup.
4,Good subtle flavored coffee for the mid-afternoon pick me up. A bit of sweetness without being overdone. Wish it was available in whole bean as I like it stronger then the Keurig cup can make it.
2,This coffee brews very weak - like a light roast.  W.P. Chef's reserve pods are just over half full.  Put pod on scale and it's 15% less coffee wgt than normal pods.  Stick with normal pods or extra bold if you like coffee that taste like coffee.
1,"This is a good decaf coffee, but I've never before had a k cup dump the contents into my cup. It's extremely irritating to deal with grounds in the cup and machine when deliberately choosing a system that avoids the mess."
2,Warning: this is a STRONG flavor.<br /><br />I thought that this would be Blue Mountain-y... oh no. It is like... rum flavored or something. Yuk.
5,I admit I don't usually drink decaf but this is a favorite in my office and I felt it deserved a good rating.
3,"With so many choices now, I thought I woudl give this a try.<br />The Donut shop Decaf is by far my favorite and this one falls short."
3,Very good tasteing product but I need to use it the smallist setting on my B-60 to really enjoy the depth.
5,"I am still waiting for Peets to come out with Kcups, but in the meantime, the Wolfgang Puck's coffees are filling the bill. I really like Sorrento AND Rodeo Drive---smooth and full bodied.<br />JS"
5,"Not too bold, not too weak...not bitter.  Good way to start if your not into the real strong coffees.  My husband and I have added the Wolfgang Puck ""Breakfast in Bed"" line and the ""Rodeo Drive"" flavors to our buying ritual."
3,"This flavored K-Cup isn't out of this world, but isn't horrible. In my opinion, it's way more flavorful than the Wolfgang Puck Hazelnut K-Cup. We love flavored coffee in our house, and so I would go with this one again. Worth a try."
4,"Never had Hawaiian Hazelnut before so I didn't know what to expect, but it turns out it's pretty good, not as flavored as say DD, but nonetheless pretty good. I have it on subscription now along with the German Chocolate Cake, another one of my favorite flavored K-cups."
5,"This has made me into a coffee lover!  Very  mild and easy on the stomach, but with a great flavor.  Love it!"
4,"Nice, light cup of coffee. Definitely not a bold brew but it's smooth and gentle on the stomach.....good for those mornings when you over did it the night before. Would buy again."
5,This is a very balanced and smooth light coffee great for a first cup of the day.
5,This is a great cup of hazelnut coffee; smooth and balanced with no chemical aftertaste.  My husband and I like it so much that we've ordered it twice directly from the Keurig manufacturer.  SO GLAD that it's now available on Amazon through subscribe and save!
1,No where in the description does it mention that this is a flavored coffee.  By the name I thought it was a Jamaican Blue Mountain blend but its flavored with a weak tasting hazelnut.  Not very good
1,I was in a hurry and did not read the reviews...I trusted amazon's description and it did NOT indicate it was flavored coffee and that it was NOT Jamaican...it is very lightly flavored with vanilla so it isnt too bad. I feel cheated.
2,I drink about 4 to 6 cups of coffee every morning - I'm always looking for a new flavor - so I gave it a try - I drank it but I would not order again. steve
5,Rodeo Drive is my absolute favorite and I'm ready to order more!  That's if I can find it.<br />I don't know why they are discontinuing it.<br />It arrived very fast.
4,"The Breakfast In Bed coffee from Wolfgang Puck is  a good medium roast coffee.  My husband, the regular coffee drinker of our house, likes it, but feels he would like the coffee more if it were a bit stronger.  The product arrived quite soon after ordering."
5,"The Wolfgang Puck Coffee, Chef's Reseerve Columbian Decaf is fantastic and very delicious.  I definitely recommend this product to anyone who wants a great cup of coffee."
5,Nice round flavor. Not harsh or botter. I enjoy it with French Vanilla creamer.  Lately it has been harder to find.  I do hope they have not discontinued it!
1,"Coffee tastes great, but the cups get torn apart when brewing.  What a mess that is!!  I am quite disappointed because I do like this flavor of coffee!!"
5,This is my wife's favorite. She grew up in Seattle and has consumed countless gallons of various types of coffee in her lifetime so I assume this is good coffee. She is also my wine taster as her palate is much more sensitive than mine.
2,"I tried this product solely for the fact it has Wolfgang's name on it.  I should have stuck with Timothy's brand.  This was way too strong to be labeled a breakfast coffee, more like a dinner coffee.  I will not be buying this again, also way too expensive compared to the others."
5,"Love this coffee, but cannot buy it through regular outlets, so am gouged by SASA Corner. Really sticks in my craw paying more than a buck a cup."
5,"We were given a Keurig for a wedding present, along with several variety packs. So far, Wolfgang Puck's Jamaica Me Crazy is our favorite, and we will definitely be repeat buyers of this flavor."
5,"This is my favorite late evening cup of coffee.  Nice flavor, just right before retiring for the night. Keep stocking this brand and I will keep coming back for it!!"
5,It's a great flavor and makes a great cup of coffee. I fine you can have more than 1 cup of this coffee and not feel like it's too much of a flavored coffee. Puck has captured a great flavor with this coffee.
1,"It sure would be nice if they stated ANYWHERE in the description of this coffee that it is flavored.  I love the Bed and Breakfast coffee, it's just plain coffee, so I was surprised when I received the Jamaica coffee and it was flavored.  YUCK!"
1,"I ordered 3 boxes of 18 each.............and opened one box to find they were PODS and not<br />for Keurig, AND I can't return them!!!?????  Yes,the pods fit into the Keurig but<br />the end product is weak and awful.  I am most disappointed"
5,I love the Wolfganag Puck flavors.  This Vienna blend is very nice.  It is medium roast so it is not too strong.  Has a wonderful flavor without being a flavored coffee.  One of my favorites.
5,We purchased an assorted package of K-Cups (by various makers) and of all the coffees THIS is my FAVE!  I really can't see any reason to ever taste-test another flavor!  It smells delicious and TASTES DELICIOUS too!!
2,"The coffee is good. However, at least half of these haven't been sealed correctly. When I brew them the edge of the foil pops open and coffee grounds go everywhere. Not fun to clean. It may have just been the batch we got, but I won't be ordering these again."
5,"Never got a delivery as fast as we did this time.  We were running low on our special coffee. We have sampled many K-cup coffees, some in assorted packs and decided this is the best.  It is mellow, never bitter and always totally enjoyable."
5,"This is my second favorite after the breakfast in bed flavor. I love Wolfgang Puck coffee. It's a little bolder then the breakfast in bed, but still smooth."
5,this is just the perfect thing to end a tired day.  the taste is smooth and warm and creamy.  i find that i look forward to having a cup while i read for a few minutes. what a treat.
4,This is good vanilla coffee.  I got this and the green mountain and prefer this one.  It has a nice sweet flavor
5,"Wolfgang Puck Hawaiian Hazelnut Coffee for Keurig brewer.  Good medium strength coffee with Hazelnut flavor. Full-body, enjoyable anytime of the day. I really like this coffee."
4,"Coffee quality is as good as expected but, close to expiring. Next time, I will spend the extra few dollars and buy the coffee localy."
5,"If you like a balanced cup of joe, this is a great choice. The coffee is smooth and balanced. There is no bitterness or bite. Thank you Chef Puck for this fantastic decaf coffee choice!"
5,"Smooth with a hint of flavor.  Medium boldness yet rich in taste.  Not a ""wake me up"" but certainly enjoyable!"
5,My second purchase of this  cofee & like the first cup it has been wonderful to wake up to.  Not too bold or brash but a good drink to start the day with
5,"The best thing that I look foreward to every morning . It makes my day ,the best tasting coffee ever"
4,I really enjoy this one and I've tried many! In my top 5. A little pricey but will order again sometime in the future.
5,"Jamaica Me Crazy is an awesome smooth coffee, Light Coconut/Vanilla flavorful taste.<br />a good coffee if you don't like real strong coffee.Highly recommend."
5,"Smooth, delicious, can't wait to wakeup with my coffee! I love all the Wolfgang Puck coffee flavors...never a dull flavor!"
5,This is our first time trying the Wolfgang Puck coffee - so glad we did!!!  It is a wonderful medium blend and great for any time of day!  I would buy it again!
5,This is the best k cup coffee that we have been able to find.  Very rich flavors and a medium + roast.  We love this one!
5,I loved this brand.  It was the best vanilla flavor of others I tried.  I would buy more if it was a better price.
5,"Fantastic taste, smooth ""feel"", no nasty aftertaste, pairs great with creamer. What more can one want from a coffee? This has become my favorite."
5,Best flavored k cup I've ever had! I recommend this for everyone. Great flavor! I've given it to all my friends and they get hooked.
5,"I didn't know what this would taste like, but I'm so glad I ordered it.  What a perfect cup of yummy coffee for a cool summer morning!"
5,"Wake up to a cup of Wolfgang Puck Coffe Breakfast in Bed (medium Roast) K-cup for Keurig. is a great way to start your day, or just sit down and relax. Try it and you will be buying more.<br /><br />Shop Amazon for Wolfgang Puck Coffee, Breakfast in Bed"
5,This is a favorite in the office and in my house. We burn through this coffee. I've tried a few of the other Wolfgang coffees and this one is by far the best. I've seen better prices for this at a lot of other places. This is an excellent coffee to start your day with.
1,"Didn't realize it was flavored and thought, when I had my first sip, that it tasted like chemicals. F-. Gave it away the next day at work."
3,"Good, but the Green Mountain reserve Sumatra is better by 1- 1 and a half stars. Sort of tastes a little stale."
5,Wonderful flavor would purchase this blend of coffee again light flavor not bitter at all and price was great the best I found anywhere
5,I find many of the K cups are a bit bitter for my taste.  I want something simple and smooth.  This coffee is wonderful!
4,Not much of a coffee drinker but this Wolfgang Vienna brand is good. Not strong but a mellow taste.  The flavored coffees are getting on my nerves and this is just a good everyday coffee flavor. Everyone in the family and visitors like it. Would buy again.
5,I truly enjoy a good cup of coffee. It does give me a lift in the morning. Wolfgang Puck really knows how to produce a fine cup. Thanks.
4,"great service and delivery for a really good product. i am constantly looking for a good hazelnut coffee and so far this is the best, along with green mountain..."
5,"My family is full of coffee snobs.  If you like robust coffee and use k-cups, this is the product for you."
5,My favorite Flavored coffee!!! This is not available in any of my local stores.  Better price than I have found at any local stores as well.
5,"If you liked flavored coffees, this one has a hint of coconut to it.  This is my favorite coffee by far. I look forward to my first cup every morning."
5,I love this coffee. Great taste and great way to start your morning. If you like flavored coffee you will like this.
5,"These K-Cups are great! The coffee is mild and yummy, but still very flavorful. I love this, cant wait to get my next shipment!"
1,This flavor is horrible.  There are many other flavors much better.  Hawaiian Hazelnut is great!  Breakfast in Bed is AWesome!
5,"This is great coffee.  I am a coffee purist.  I don't add cream or sugar (unless it is weak or bitter). I truly enjoy coffee.  I have tried many different types of coffee for K-cups.  This is my new favorite. The price was amazing too.  Very smooth and subtle hazelnut flavor, not overpowering."
5,"Take it from someone who was tried a lot of different K-cups, BUY THESE! The ""Breakfast in Bed"" blend is full of great flavor, roasted perfectly, and more importantly I have been choosing it over Green Mountain, which says a lot. It's true to its name, perfect for the morning."
3,"I like dark strong coffee but I just didn't really care for this one.  Not sure what it really was, almost a tad bitter?  Unfortunately I have another whole box of 24 to use up.  I picked up some Sumatran Reserve (also a dark) and prefer it."
5,"I have tried many different k-cups and this has remained my favorite for the longest time. It is the perfect balance, not too weak and not too bold. And since I usually drink my coffee black, the flavor alone is very important to me. It' has a great flavor and not too acidic."
3,"If you like your flavored coffee to taste like coffee, this may not be for you.  I couldn't taste the coffee at all in the travel size brew, but the smaller brew sizes were a bit better."
5,"Amazon had this as buy one get one free and since it was my favorite, I could not resist.  Great purchase."
5,"this product is great tasting and you don't even need sugar or creamer, but if you like sweet coffee i'd say a little sugar and creamer would not hurt, this is a perfect product to wake up to every morning :)"
5,This coffee is so smoothe.  I brew my morning cup with the medium cup size and it is delicious. It is a little weak on the large cup size setting.
4,"This is a smooth not bitter coffee. It's a little more pricey than some which are just as good, but it has a good sweet flavor, and I can recommend it."
5,I bought a small 3 pack of this locally and liked it so much I bought the 48 pack.  Great deal on Amazon.
5,Bought a sample pack today of the Jamaica Me Crazy and love the flavor.  The flavor is not too powerful nor was it  overwhelming.  I'd recommend the Wolf Gang Puck k-cups.
5,"This is the smoothest and best tasting Keurig coffee I've tried.  It's not bitter, not too weak, not too strong, just right!"
5,"These are awesome...as are all of Wolfgang Puck's k-cups. The coffee is smooth, the cups brew perfectly, the taste is unbelievable! My husband and I are hooked on these. The price is great considering what amazing coffee this is!!"
5,WOLFGANG PUCK'S FRENCH ROAST HAS A DEEP ROBUST FLAVOR. I PREFER IT IN THE AFTERNOON... SOMETIMES WITH A SHOT OF GRAN MARNIER... OH YEAH...
4,"This one is my wife's favorite of all the Hazlenut blends she has tried. This is her ""go to"" after a busy day of being retired.<br />Delivery was exceptional as usual, could not ask for much more."
5,"I drink my coffee black,so quality is a must! This is an excellent medium roast with a smooth consistency and perfect amount of kick. I love all the Wolfgan Puck coffee k-cups, but this is absolutely my favorite!"
5,I drink a lot of coffee and I buy several different types. I found this particular one to be pleasant tasting with a nice aroma while brewing. There is no after-taste so you always want another cup.
5,"Wonderful tasty coffee with a nice aroma as it is brewing. There is no after-taste at all and it very satisfying, you always want another cup of coffee. I continue to buy it."
5,A very nice flavor with no after-taste. It gives off a nice fragrance while brewing and has a very satisfying taste. You have to have another cup!
4,"Dark and full flavored, but distinctly Columbian.  This is a great morning coffee. Better cup of AM Joe than you will get at a coffee place."
5,"My favorite of the Wolfgang series discovered when trying all of the flavors in the available sample pack. Very good flavor, consistent with each pod and not overdone with added flavors. Very good dark roast Colombian cup of coffee from the Wolf."
5,We have tried all of the Hazelnut flavored coffee brands.  This is by far the best.  To bad it isn't an auto ship.
5,"I've tried lots of flavors of coffee and this one is my favorite! Great taste, not bitter at all. A great flavored coffee for people who don't really like the taste of coffee."
5,"the aroma is awesome!!  love the flavor, really gets you going in the morning.  prompt delivery, this is definatly my husbands favorite single cup coffee"
4,"After 5 years with the Keurig, this is the best .  If you like a medium blend, it perfect.  Its smooth, and has taste. Not watered down on either setting."
5,Wolfgang Puck makes the BEST coffee! The package arrived on time and in perfect condition! I would definitely order this again.
5,Have enjoyed every single cup of Breakfast in Bed. Just the right kind of brew to wake up these old bones and get me started on the day's adventure. Also enjoy it while watching NCIS so I can join Gibbs enjoying a brew as well.
5,I love this coffee - it's one of my all time favorites - it has the best flavor and I like the light roast.<br /><br />EXCELLENT!!!!
3,"I love my Keurig but haven't found my ""perfect"" cup of coffee yet, although this comes close. I prefer a medium brew, not bold or strong. Breakfast in Bed is my choice so far."
5,Truly not much needs to be said because it's Wolf and to wake up to his coffee here at the house is fantastic!
4,"I expected more flavor from W. Puck. Though this coffee does taste good, it didn't have caramel flavor as expected. This is my opinion. Someone else may feel differently. The price is okay, I would not discount this product at all. It's a good product. Try it, you may like it."
5,I've tried all Vanilla coffee K-cups and by far this is the best! Wolf Gang Puck Vanilla Francaise is a smooth vanilla experience that lasts way after the coffee is consumed.  Try it you'll love it!
5,"I am not a huge coconut fan, so I wasn't excited about trying this, but with one sip it definitely won me over!  The flavor is perfect and is now one of the flavors in our regular rotation.  And it smells so good!!!"
5,This is my daughter's favorite K-cup product. Mild medium roast it is the next best thing to having Wolfgang cooking breakfast for you in your kitchen.
5,"I'm sure this flavor isn't for everyone, but if you enjoy your coffee on the sweeter and more flavorful side then you should enjoy this. It is not what I would call a ""strong"" coffee by any means. I would describe it as mild and flavorful."
4,"I was really impressed with this coffee, it has a nice bold taste, yet a smooth<br /> finish. I would order this coffee again."
5,This is my absolute favorite coffee flavor out there!  I'm so glad it comes in K-Cups!  And I'm glad it is so inexpensive!
5,I find this particular brand as good as the local coffee shop coffee (D.D.) which is a compliment to the maker. I have made this particular brand my #1 choice.
5,"I normally drink only Donut Shop, but when I saw this on sale I thought I would give it a try.  I was quite impressed with it and really enjoy this one.  I have now added it to my list of favorite K-cups to buy."
2,"Vanilla flavor is barely noticeable.  Acidic taste, not at all what I expected.  Breakfast in Bed and Hawaiian Hazelnut are much better choices."
5,I really like the flavor of this one! It has a low acidity but still full of flavor! Now I have to have it every morning and I am having trouble finding another one I like this much.
5,"This is the best tasting coffee available on k-cups!!!! The flavor is amazing, it is more expensive than other brands, but for a reason. Definitely worth trying."
5,This is one of the best coffees I have ever had for my Keurig.  It is a nice smooth coffee.  And the price is the best price I could find.  I will be buying more.
5,My husband and I are obsessed with this coffee...we take Kcups and hide them around the house because we wanna make sure it lasts a long time! Such a bold and delicious flavor!
5,"I had tried this coffee before, it is wonderful.  Smooth and rich, full flavored, but not too bold. I would recommend it to anyone."
3,"The coffee is good,however the k-cup is not packaged well,the coffee machine barely streams coffee,more of a fast drip.  The whole idea is it's fast,right?"
5,"It was a bit of a risk to order this, I mean what are you going to do with 2 boxes of kcups that taste terrible? But this was delish, the flavor was really good, and it was still awesome after it had cooled down. It has a coconutty, vanilla flavor, very nice!!"
4,"I like the Jamaica Me Crazy better, but when it's out of stock, this is my second choice.<br /><br />It's got a nice flavor & strength, without being bitter."
5,"This is my favorite KCup.  I'd describe it as medium-dark, creamy and rich.  And very consistent.  A lot of k-cups seem acidic to me, so i'm really glad i found this one. :]"
5,"Very delicious coffee, thankfully Amazon sells this flavor now.  I have been waiting for it since I tasted this last year.  I like the fact that you sell it in a 2 Pack rather than a single."
5,"Delicious coffee, good medium blend.  Its hard to find something that isnt too weak or too bold with K-cups, but this flavor was perfect.  Will buy again."
5,"Good flavor.  Coconut flavor is subtle and not overpowering.  In comparison, there is another coconut coffee by Green Mountain in which the coconut flavor is overdone in my opinion."
2,"While good quality, it was not at all what I expected. It smelled like caramel and vanilla, but it tasted like straight black coffee. I was pretty disappointed."
3,"The coffee is just OK, a little weak. The price is a little high and it is not worth the extra money."
2,I was surprised to find out how weak this coffee is.  It has a good flavor but even on half cup it is very weak.
5,"To me, this has a good, balanced flavor.  Some flavored K-cups seem too light on hazelnut, or too light on coffee.  This one is just right."
4,This k-cup actually smelled up the office. And it tastes as good as it smells. I found it to be very flavorful.
5,"Light and flavorful definitely describes this K-Cup. I often find it hard to find flavored K-Cups that aren't either 1) so strong you lose the flavor or 2) so light you'd be better off drinking water. However, I have to admit I have found a new favorite in the Hawaiian Hazelnut!"
5,Best K cup around. A must try!  Amazon ships quickly and in one piece. I'd recommend the coffee as well as going through Amazon to order this coffee from.  Thank you for a great experience.
4,Usually do not get the breakfast blends but it was on sale and decided at price would try it out. It was not as weak as some breakfast blends tend to be. Not bad.
4,Wolfgang Puck definitely has the best coffee for the money.  I absolutely love the French Vanilla.  The KCup actually makes a good full cup of coffee.  it could be a tad stronger but overall it is really good.  I still prefer the Senseo Pods to the KCups though.
4,"Jamaica Me Crazy has a slight overtone of cinnamon that is a very nice compliment to the taste of coffee.  The flavoring is strong enough to taste, not just smell, without overpowering the flavor of the coffee.  Very good."
5,I drink my coffee with a splash of half-and-half.  Other hazelnut k-cups are too bland for me.  I much prefer Wolfgang Puck's excellent rich roast with definite -- but not overpowering -- hazelnut flavor.
3,Too bad no one else had reviewed this before my purchase. It's not bold or dark enough to stand up to the Keurig's 3rd button and tasted a little tangy for my liking.
5,"This coffee says medium roast but is actually a little stronger.  We loved it and it has become our favorite.  If you want some coffee to ""caffeine you up"", this is the one for you!!  Also, Wolfgang Puck's Breakfast in Bed is great...not so strong!"
4,"This is very good coffee, but it doesn't have as much flavor as the Van Houttes creme caramel.  If your looking for something that has a lot of flavor, go with the other.  If you are looking for something that is more coffee than flavor, this is it."
4,"By far,this is the best flavored K cup coffee I've ever had. Good body, not bitter, no flowery aroma (like with the Green Mountain flavored K cups). I like my coffee a little stronger than Puck's Hawaiian Hazelnut, but it is certainly a fine, medium bodied,coffee I could drink over and over."
5,These K cups are wonderful! We were pleasantly surprised with the low acidity and smooth flavor! The Rodeo Drive K cups are on our top five K Cup list!
5,Bought this during one of Amazon's Friday Sales.  Did not find too many reviews since these are fairly new.  Took a chance and am very pleased.  We like our coffee rich and strong and this one delivers.  Great tasting dark roast coffee!
2,"I personally did not care for the coffee, too mild for me and a little ""nutty"" flavor in it.  I will stick with Tully's Kona and House blends, also Emeril's Big Easy bold."
5,Exact same as the ones bought at the store only a lot cheaper. Recommended for any Keurig drinkers out there.
5,This is my #1 favorite coffee. Blending of hazelnut and coconut are perfect.  Thank you!!<br /><br />Question:  why was I charged postage on this brand when I have never paid on any other brand of K-Cups from Amazon
5,If you like your Keurig you need to try this K-cup.  Smooth taste with just a slight hint of flavor.  Not overwhelming like some brands.  My new favorite.
5,"This is our favorite k-cup coffee, it is strong - and taste great (although it seems that many of the k-cups) have nearly the same overall taste..."
3,"More than a ""hint"" of coconut! Not very much vanilla. Being a vanilla fan and NOT a coconut fan - this is OK."
4,"This is a good tasting K-cup from a guy who drinks coffee black and prefers a bold, full flavored taste. I would recommend."
5,"I love using K Cups!  Although I have tried so many ""bad"" coffees.  I have finally hit on one dark roast coffee that isn't bitter and has a wonderful flavor.  You don't have to try them all, this is a perfect blend coffee."
5,"Ok - so this is the best flavored coffee ever.  No after taste that seems to always occur w/flavored coffees & its not even really flavored, it has hint of coconut taste but it really still tastes like coffee just the best coffee ever... mmmmmm... add honey.. yummy!!!!!<br />Highly recommend!"
4,Wolfgang puck k cups are under the radar - their coffees are smooth and delicious and Jamaica Me Crazy is my fav and the best coconut flavored coffee on the market. Island coconut is quite poor in comparison.
5,"I've always hated the Peete's or Starbucks burnt-bitter taste. This is a great blend, still strong without the burn roasting.<br /><br />FYI, low quality beans are burned to hide it's bad taste."
5,"I like the darker roast coffees and this fits the bill.  This is every bit as good as Deidrich and Tulley's but typically costs more.  I guess Wolkgang wants a cut.  If you catch it on sale, buy it."
3,"This coffee is a lot like the Green Mountain Nantucket blend.  If you like that, you'll like this.  Generally, the GM product costs less, but this was on sale."
5,"It was as good, if not better, than I was told!  Great taste!  I will puchase it again."
1,"...I will drink this if all other coffee options are exhausted. The coffee has a vanilla/coconut smell but after a sip or two, I can't drink it. Would not purchase again and I'm having trouble even giving it away. I expected more from Wolfgang Puck."
1,"I love caramel and was excited when this arrived. But I AM SO DISAPPOINTED. Hardly any flavor at all, of coffee or caramel"
5,This is an excellent full-bodied coffee without a bitter taste. In general the Wolfgang Puck coffees are quite good although a little more expensive than some of the other K-Cups.
5,"As always, I LOVE this coffee, it's about the only kind I buy for myself.  The turn around time is terrific.  When I have about a week's worth of cups left, I order and have the next batch in perfect timing.  Very happy with everything about this product."
5,"This coffee is a smooth, yet robust taste that does not have any bad after<br />taste. <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B003VXJJ28"">Wolfgang Puck Coffee, Rodeo Drive Blend (Medium Roast), 24-Count K-Cups for Keurig Brewers (Pack of 2)</a>"
5,"Sometimes we have a problem ordering the k-cups because they are way too strong for us--even if you order medium blend.  This coffee was great--just right!  It was a smooth blend, and was perfect for a morning cup of coffee--or anytime!  Would definitely order again!"
5,"Good description of this product. Has the over roasted popular coffee flavor, but, not overpowering. One of my favorites so far."
5,I ordered this by accident and I'm so happy I did. This is a new favorite of mine. It's nice and strong without being bitter.
3,"It's coconut flavored, either you'll like it or not.  I was actually surprised since I'm not a big fan of coconut, but I liked this coffee.  Not my favorite, but nice on occasion."
5,"My friend says she loves this coffee and has never been able to find it in the local stores where we live.  Aha, she did not know that Amazon sells just about anything you could want - no tax and free shipping.  What could be better."
4,"hazelnut being the household favorite favorite, I thought I'd give these k-cups a try. The flavor is smooth and delightful. I suggest trying this brand for your k-cup machine!"
4,"This is good, but could be a bit stronger in the Hazelnut flavor. It is good though and I would purchase it again."
1,I love the taste but have found that many of the cups explode!!  The glue on the side of the cup becomes undone and then the cup explodes.  Very hard to clean up.  Do not think I will buy this brand again!
5,"I love Jamaica Me Crazy coffee. This version is flavorful, the price is pretty good, and it sure beats the office pot coffee that sits on a burner for hours. Fresh coffee, fast!"
3,"This is less of a ""bold"" flavor and more of an acidic and bitter coffee. My wife is easy to please and she's not a fan. I'll finish the box but I reach of others first."
5,"This coffee has become one of my daily favorites.  It's not quite as strong as many of the french roasts, but it's also not as bitter.  A good way to start the day."
5,"I have had all of the various Keurigs since they came on the market for home use. Thus,I have tried pretty near all of the various k-cups. This is one of my top 5 favorites. Love the coconut in it, and the wonderful coffee flavor. YUM!!!!"
4,This coffee was not what I expected but enjoyed it greatly.  I was looking for a stronger vanilla flavor but after trying it I enjoyed it a lot. It was light and smooth and left no aftertaste.  I would recommend this to others.
4,"I like Columbian coffee and this is above average with a good dark color with a nice smell.  The taste is bolder than average but not unpleasant or bitter.  This is my ""strong"" Columbian coffee combining all the good things of the type with a bolder taste."
4,smooth.  I normally drink dark roasts but purchased this on a lightning deal (or maybe a friday sale).  I like it.
3,"The coffee is just OK. It's very mild, almost bordering on weak. Would buy it again if the price was right."
5,I've tried every bold k-cup and this is one is one of my favorites.  Very nice flavor and strength.
3,"Bought this on the recommendation of my son.  Not a big fan of flavored coffee, but a cup a day of this lightly flavored coconut coffee puts me in the islands.  How can you go wrong with Wolfgang Puck?"
1,This coffee says Dark Roast & Extra Bold and.... IT ISN'T! It's weak and barely beats out a cup of Folgers.
5,"This is my favorite coffee flavor and I have not had it in a long time.  Forgot how delicious it was until we ordered the k-cups.  Love them, already ordered more."
5,I bought this coffee for my Keurig coffee maker and I really like it. Smooth  and the best thing it is an organic. Wolfgang uses the the best beans for his coffee's. Buy you will be pleasantly surprised.
5,"great tasting coffee. strong, but not obnoxiously strong and no nasty aftertaste. too bad, it cannot be purchased on subscribe and save anymore."
5,This is the best all around 1st cup in the morning coffee ever!  I love it.  Perfect flavor.
5,By far the tastiest coffee I have purchased from Amazon.  Sorry it isn't in the Shop and Save any longer.  Delicious!!!
5,"Love this blend, so was delighted to find it on your ""Subscribe & Save"" program (at a better price<br />than w/Keurig.  So REALLY disappointed to learn today it was no longer available on said program.<br />Shame on manufacturerer!"
5,"I have tried about 25 different K-Cup flavors, and this is my favorite.  It has a wonderful aroma, and just the right amount of Hazelnut.  Use the subscribe option, and this is a deal that can't be beat."
5,I buy these with subscribe and save.  I like the flavor and aroma.  Going on month two and I am not tired of them yet!
4,One of the weaker flavored coffees but a yummy one.  Almost no need for milk as it is already creamy tasting.
5,"This coffee is awesome.  Kinda bold, with a sweetness.  Excellent my son says with International's Carmel Macchiado creamer you can find in the dairy section."
5,The coffee was great. Spent some time in Jamaica and got to love the coffee. Nice to get in back home as well.
5,I like full-bodied coffee and to try something different to supplement the standard one I use.  This coffee was perfect for that purpose. Timothy's Rainforest Expresso is still my standard one...but I will order this again.
5,"Creme Caramel is by far my newest favorite!  Great coffee flavor, not too weak, with a wonderful caramel aroma!"
5,"I drink alot of coffee and love hazelnut coffee, this brand has the best flavor I have ever tasted. I have bought several different brands and this one is the BEST! It may be a few dollars more but it is worth it. I absolutely love and enjoy it every morning."
2,"I REALLY like the taste of this coffee! My only complaint is that the coffee grinds end up in my coffee. Not a huge fan of that and even though I really like the taste of it I will not order again, bummer!! =("
5,"My favorite, I have it auto shipped through Amazon. The only problem I have is I drink way too much coffee now because I like it so much."
5,This is one of my favorite K-cups.  It's a rich dark coffee without the bitterness of some.  Highly recommended.
3,I thought the coffee tasted fine.  It was not strong enough for my husband.  Several of the pods burst during brewing.  I probably won't purchase this again.
5,This is my favorite of the flavored coffees. I am not usually a fan of coconut but this coffee is deliciously coconutty-chocolaty! Love it!
5,"Yummy, mild, and delicious. My new favorite! Mild in comparision to coffees called ""rocket fuel"" and taste like motor oil, but truly a medium roast. Pleasant in the morning. Makes you glad to have a good cup of coffee."
5,Wolfgang Puck coffees are great and the Creme Caramel is one of my favorites. I would recommend this coffee for people who like a mild flavor.
4,I thought that because of the name attached that I would be wow-ed...its just a good average coffee nothing spectacular.
5,"I prefer mild to medium coffee and I've tried so many different k-cups but I'll stay with this one the other reviews were right on , smooth and not any bitterness. Just a great cup of joe. With amazon prime it came super fast, if you're not a prime member I strongly recommend it."
1,"This is a good French roast coffee, although it could be a little bolder. I've never before had a k cup dump the contents into my cup. It's extremely irritating to deal with grounds in the cup and machine when deliberately choosing a system that avoids the mess."
4,"I am impressed with Mr Puck's different blends, this one is a favorite of ours. It lives up to the ""medium roast"" name, full bodied, not acidic and smells great while brewing, will buy again."
5,Great Deal - GREAT turnaround!  What a difference from other orders I have placed with other vendors!  Got the package the day after I ordered it!
5,"If you like vanilla flavored coffee, this is it!! I put a french vanilla creamer in and no other sweetner is needed. I have it every day and I'll always order ahead so I don't run out."
5,"This coffee is Bold and none of the bitterness that is usually found in bold coffee's.  It also scored exeptional in the single serve coffee ratings and I concur.  There is a lot of dreck out there in K-Cups, this and Wolfgang Puck's Hawaiian Hazelnut are great!"
2,"I got this is a low cost alternative to my normal Jet Fuel and it just didn't measure up. I like strong coffee but this had a bitter taste that I just didn't care for. Also, 3 of the cups had some sort of malfunction and dumped their grinds into my cup-not sure why."
5,Very smooth and flavorful for a medium roast.  I was pleasantly surprised by this k cup and would get it again. The 25% off deal drew me to it and I'm glad.
5,"This is my favorite of all the coffees I've tried. Smooth and flavorful without being a flavored coffee, its a definite treat anytime of day."
3,"I was expecting a mellow caramel flavor, but this coffee is a bit sharp and you really can't make out any carmel flavor."
4,"This product takes getting used to.  Only after using about 3 K-cups did I start liking it.  However, I wouldn't buy this many again."
5,I'm loving this coffee!! It's smooth and bold but not too bold. It reminds me of starbucks coffee but not as bitter. Very very very good cup of coffee. Give it a try. I'm really glad I did.
2,I love Wolfgang Puck products but the coffee is very disappointing.<br />There is a weak flavor - almost tastes diluted!<br />Some troll must have changed out all the real Puck products!<br />Libbie
1,This is the 1st K-cup coffee that I am getting grounds in my coffee. It is occuring about every 3 cups. I have not had this problem with other K cup manufactures. I will not reorder.
5,"Until I tried Vienna Coffee House, Donut Shop was the one I had on automatic monthly delivery.  Vienna Coffee House is a tad bolder than Donut Shop but very smooth without any bitterness.  From the first cup, I knew I had to switch."
5,I love coffee with no bitterness and lots of good coffee taste and this one fits the bill. Holds up well to milk & sugar-I love it in the morning for the first cup and in the evening just as much. Definitely would buy it again.
1,I bought a 24 pack of this an drank almost all of them before realizing what the flavor reminded me of. It tastes like hotdog water.
5,I like my coffe of the milder but tasteful side.  I thought this was a great cup of coffe I compare it to Timothy's dounut shoppe.  Full flavor but not acid.  This is for people who want a lighter cup of coffee
5,Jamican Me Crazy is the best coffee.  It is not too strong and has a unique taste.  No complaints here.  Highly recommend it.
5,This not only tastes great but has the best aroma while brewing. Subscribe and save is the way to go.
4,trying out different pods and this is a delicious one. service was excellent. no hassle at all. will buy from again
5,"I like this coffee, its nice to drink it in the morning. It has medium body and full flavour. Goes great with raw sugar and splash of non fat milk."
5,"I'm a sucker for caramel anything.........love the flavor, the aroma, and most important the taste.  I honestly do not like flavored coffees in the morning, but I have made an exception for this one!"
2,"I thought it had a bitter orange flavor, however my husband and friend liked it."
5,I like a dark rich coffee and this is a tad different.  It seems much smoother and<br />I tend to nearly crave it when I have a slightly acid stomach.  It sounds odd and<br />I know I drink too much coffee but this fills that acid tummy niche.
3,"My husband likes strong coffee.  I like medium.  Neither one of us like this particular one.  There just isn't much flavor of any kind...coffee or caramel.  We like the vanilla one much better.  We'll drink this until it's gone...but it's the last flavor we choose, and it's lasting way too long!"
3,"The taste is fine, but the K-cup container has opened at the seal during the brewing process on more than one occasion, resulting in a mouthful of coffee grounds!  I have never had this happen with any other brand of K-cup before and hope it is not the norm for Wolfgang Puck."
3,"I prefer the ""extra bold"" coffees, so this one really lacking on the flavor.  It's fairly weak, at the smallest cup setting its drinkable, but I won't be buying it again.  I'd recommend the Timothy's World Coffee, Rainforest Decaf Espresso instead."
5,Wolfgang's Reserve Columbian Decaf is probably the best decaf we have had in a K-cup. Very good cup of coffee!
4,This is a coffee that I look forward to drinking as soon as I wake up! Very nice......
5,"Light vanilla favor....not overpowering. Nice coffee, the first box that was purchased was too light on the vanilla flavor and aroma....surprisingly the 2nd box was much better.  One of my new favorites."
5,"We love our Keurig coffeemaker and have tried many coffees.  Recently discovered Wolfgang Puck's new line of coffees and are pleased with all of his we have tried.  This one is smooth with a great flavor, no bite.  We would purchase this again."
5,"This is a mild but delicious coffe....some might say ""a dessert coffee"". I really liked it as a pleasant change from full bodied flavors."
5,"Was looking for a strong K-Cup that could hold up for the perfect Espresso and for a great cup of coffee! Now receiving on auto ship, if you're looking for a great bold K-Cup, this is it."
5,"I read several great reviews on this coffee on another site and decided to give it a try. It's now one of my favorites and I will be ordering it again. The taste is great, sweet but bold enough that I can do a large size and it still have flavor."
5,Great coffee.  Has a nice bold taste for a medium roast coffee. This is my new favorite. Give it a whirl.
3,Taste is okay.  Not blown away.  Hidden is the fact that this is truly a decaffeinated coffee.  Only place to find this out is on the bottom of the box.  Not what I want first thing in the morning.
1,I use to purchase Jamaica beans locally and it was great. This Jamaica me crazy is nothing close to it. The odor is terrible and it tastes like the coffee is flat or stale. Other people in household tried it and couldn't get past the first cup. Pitched the remainder cups in the trash.
1,"this was terrible coffee Wolfgang Pucks Jamaicamecrazy, I received a partial refund but felt I should have gotten a full refund as I can't drink the coffee and had to throw it all away. Also had to pay shipping and should not of had to. I would like a response to this."
3,"We love Hazelnut coffee, but this just didn't have enough coffee flavor in it for me. Kind of on the weak side in my opinion. I'll keep looking."
5,"Love this coffee! The aroma is as delicious as the flavor. My husband would typically have a cup of coffee once or twice a month, now he's having a cup several times a week."
2,"I admit, I am not terribly fond of flavored coffees. But, this one is not for us. We both love the Rodeo Drive. I have a good freind that loves this coffee. I sent her ours."
1,"I am definitely not a coffee connoisseur, but this stuff is bad.  It is a disappointment because I expected a Wolfgang Puck product to have more ""class.""  This tastes artificial and it can't stand alone without tons of cream and sweetener.  Will not buy again!"
1,The coffee tasted bitter and like it was burnt.  I cleaned the machine and it still tasted bitter and burnt.  Will not order this again.
1,"I'm amazed that people are happy with this product.  I'm not a drinker of the dark brews, French roast or anything, but even for a drinker of a milder cup of coffee, this is completely tasteless.  The initial scent is delicious, too bad none of it shows up in the actual coffee."
2,I got this through a Decaf Keurig assortment pack (also from amazon) and while I have enjoyed all of the flavors - thisone was so weak - I had to post a review.
1,This Wolfgang Puck Coffee Jamaica Me Crazy is the worst coffee I've ever had!<br />I threw it out right away after one sip! It taste like all coconut flavoring.<br />Hard to believe someone thought this taste good and was marketable. They should be fired!
1,Ugh... no where on the Amazon page for this item did it state that it was Hazelnut flavored.  I have been choking this down for a month just trying to get through it.  Thought it was going to be a Blue Mountain-like Jamaican coffee...
4,"It is a medium roast pleasant coffee, comparable to green mountain's breakfast blend. I bought it with a very good deal though."
1,This stuff tasted like pipe tobacco smells. My Son didn't like it either and I ended up throwing it out.
5,"Simply Awesome. I love bold coffee and love French Roast Brews. This is a truly wonderful FR blend. Dittos for Deidrich FR, both are awesome.<br /><br />I also tend to like the BOLD COFFEE PEOPLE KCUPS...Most all I've tried have been bold and flavorful, each with it's own distinct flavor."
4,"Highly recommended for those who appreciate a good dark roast coffee, Wolfgang's Sumatra Kopi Raya excites the flavor buds and ignites one's morning... always a good start to any day."
2,No thanks.  Kind of bitter and has slight overtone of cardboard.  Organic Bold and Donut Shop are still our faves.
1,The worst!!! it is just plan awful bitter and strong and you cannot taste the Hazel Nut flavor at all!!!!!  Do not buy this product save your money!!!!!
1,I thought this coffee was really horrible. Had one cup and will throw the rest away because it can't be returned.
4,Definitely not extra bold...medium roast at best.  Not particularly memorable...doesn't have a good coffee aroma...but it's pretty decent tasting.  At this point I'm not sure if I would reorder.
1,this coffee has a very funny taste to it not good you would think wolfgang it would be good dont buy this coffee this is a review of 6 people there are 6 people in my shop we all hate it not good
2,"Wolfgang Puck's ""Breakfast in Bed"" is a much more flavorful and robust medium roast than this one."
4,"This coffee has a very tropical taste to it, so it's perfect for iced coffee on a hot day.  The flavor is not bad when heated, but it just seems a little odd.<br /><br />You don't usually think of tropical beverages being hot."
5,I am not a fan of any of the decaf k cups I have tried but this one is probably the best.I like strong coffee and his comes pretty close to what I would expect although it says medium roast.
5,"I just got my box today and brewed a cup after work. It's one of my favorite k-cups yet!! I recommend it. Smooth, doesn't taste watered down, and no bitter aftertaste. The cups also look pretty in my k-cup rack :-)"
5,"Wolfgang Puck's Hawaiian Hazelnut is the best K-Cup Hazelnut and I have tried them all. We ordered this large pack, because we sadly found out that Wolfgang Puck is discontinuing many (not all) of their K-Cups, including this flavor. Buy this while you can!"
5,"So far, of all the decaf Kcups we have tried, this is our favorite.  Wish it were on the automatic ordering system.  Coffee is such an individual like or dislike but when we use it with an 8oz cup of water it is great."
5,I bought the Kuerig because I love the Dunkin Original and Green Mountain Nantucket Blend.  Rodeo Drive has now become my favorite.  It is very delicious and smooth.
5,"When I feel that I do not need more caffine, I have found that the Wolfgang Puck Decaf is a great substitute.  I really can't tell the difference, taste wise.  I had been having trouble finding a good decaf.  I think this one is it."
5,"I got a 5 k-cup sample box of this coffee from Keureg, and I find that it is my favorite decaf coffee. It brews a smooth tasting cup of coffee every time. I add some 1/2 & 1/2 and a bit of Equal, and it is a treat any time.<br />Glad to have found this coffee."
5,"Wolfgang Puck coffees are very good. This particular flavor of decaf is delicious - doesn't taste like decaf at all, very rich & flavorful. Also, this was a very good value for the price. I've recommended this product to several friends."
4,"I am usually a non flavored coffee drinker, but I do like to mix things up every now and again. This is a lightly coconut flavored coffee. The coffee itself is a medium brew and it goes well with the tropical undertones of the coconut. It is a nice summer drink."
5,I love quite a few coffees but this one is grabbing my whole households attention. It's not bitter but it's not light either. It's perfect. I love it.
4,"I switched to Decaf and was looking for a decent cup on the Keurig machine.  I was only interested in Subscribe and Save options.<br /><br />This is a fairly light roast, which I like.  I brew on the middle setting and I think if it was brewed any larger I would think it was too light."
5,Absolutely love Wolfgang Puck Rodeo Drive K Cups.  It is the best.  Nice rich flavor but not too strong.  Best one yet!
5,I have purchase this coffee several times my husband said it has a great taste and it is a good cup of coffee
5,"I think this is a love it or hate it kind of coffee.  I love it.  The flavor starts out similar to butter toffee, but then sort of morphs into coconut, pineapple, and rum.  I think it's delicious and unique, and I don't ever want to be without some in my cupboard."
5,"We've tried many of the K-cups that are available, and this is in our top 3. We prefer a darker, bolder flavor, and this one hits the mark. At the same time it's quite smooth."
5,"This k-cup is one of my favorites along with Coffee People's Jet Fuel and Black Tiger.  If you like a strong, rich coffee, this will fit the bill."
5,"Not too strong, not too weak...smooth without the bitterness.  Great anytime for those not into the strong ""grow hair on your chest"" types.  We will continue to purchase this as a part of our favorite brands."
5,Wolfgang's Rodeo Drive does make a good ole cup of coffee. It is on the same line as Donut Shop. Very good morning coffee to wake up with.
3,The coffee was more on the light side rather than medium roast.  I don't think I would purchase it again even though it was a good value purchase.
5,This coffee is for those who like a strong robust flavor. Nothing wimpy about it. I like just enough cocoa mix and creamer to take off the edge. My husband goes for the gusto. Great wake-me-up-in-the-morning brew. Love it!
5,"This is an excellent blend perfect for any time. Was really surprised by the quality, flavor and finish."
2,"As coffee, these kcups are just ok.  As ""flavored"" coffee these are disappointing.  I found the vanilla to be barely detectable."
5,"Nice, smooth cup of Joe. High recommend. Not sure why there is not more reviews?!?!"
4,"This coffee was in a ""sample"" selection when we ordered our Keurig Brewer.  It was by far our favorite!  I have ordered this coffee several times from Amazon.  It is a dark roast, but not too strong."
5,You get a consistent cup of coffee with a hint of hazelnut. A cup of hot coffee in about 20 seconds that tastes great... what's not to like about that?! :)
4,These have a stronger caramel flavor although still a medium strength coffee.  The best caramel flavored K-cup I've tried!  I will reorder them.
4,love this Rodeo Drive it has a very drinkable taste is also good and it is smooth! I recomend that you try this one.
5,This is the most delicious coffee ever It does not mess up your stomach it's amazing and tastes wonderful and everyone at work loves it too
3,I really like medium strength coffee but this is a little too bold to be considered medium. It is almost bitter when compared to other medium coffees.
5,Great product to start your AM with as its not too strong but just the right tast for your morning wake us up.
3,This coffee is okay but certainly not as good as Green Mountain's Breakfast Blend. It just doesn't taste as good.
3,"This is a great flavored coffee nevertheless, K-cups are getting too expensive for everyday home use.  I am now using the filler and using my own ground coffee much of the time. It's also helpful to look for other price alternatives."
5,"We recently started eating vegetarian meals, and this product is organic and very solid, you won't get a ton of water like you get in store bought Tofu, you will be happy with the quality and fast delivery."
5,I use this in place of mayo for many recipes when I need something creamy and quick.  This also works very nice for sweet dishes as there is very little taste to the tofu and it does absorb flavors well like a chocolate pie.
5,"Love these tofu as they don't require refrigeration until the package is open! I use tofu a lot in my cooking, so have them handy all the time makes it really convenient! The price is not too bad for an organic tofu."
5,"Good firm texture, comparing to other silken firm, this is just the right consistency. Hassle-free, it is easy to come out from the container Tofu shape as is.  Easy to handle and manage rather than crash or smash it."
5,"1000 island dressing...strawberry shakes...tofu faux omelet...!Convenient..fast..long shelf life..delish and organic,I order several 12pks at a time.I will also use this product for baking."
4,I like this brand and think the shelf-stable packaging is great since I can't seem to find the organic version locally. It's been delicious in my recipes.
5,"These tiny candies are as delicious as they are presentable. Every single kind of them tastes great! They are packaged well. When I am through the bag, I am ordering it again!!"
3,"Eye Bought This Product On A Recommendation. However, Eye Cannot Seem To Get Past The Strange Taste Yet.  Eye Will Keep Using It To See If This Will Pass Or If Eye Will Acquire A Liking To It.  The Package States No Bitter Taste.  If It Is A Sweetener, Why Should There Be Any Bitter Taste?"
1,Product has a shelf life of two years and was labeled as produced in December of 2009. Product leaked from seal in carton.
5,I love passion fruit juice and this is a very good product. Each bottle makes about a gallon. It is low in sugar and low on glycemic index. Has a lot of potassium and is a natural relaxer. Makes great cocktails too if it isn't relaxing enough for you straight up! Fast delivery and great product!
5,"Awesome!  This powder was bought as a media replacement for my Ant Works ant farm.  I haven't tried it as a food supplement, but mixed with a little food dye, Pedialite & sugar; it worked perfectly as Ant Gel.<br /><br />It makes a firm gel clear that holds at room temperature."
4,I agree with the reviewer who said it won't give you 100% the firmness of jello but it does satisfy my cravings!  Wonderful product!
5,Not really much to say about the product other than it arrived similar to as pictured and works as described. I used it as a natural stabilizer for doughnut icing which was excellent. American Wholesale got it to me in 4 days. I purchased 2 oz. USA product.
4,"I needed this for a no-bake cheese cake and I don't use gelatin, kind of creeps me out. But it worked well for what I needed, be sure to read directions."
4,"Product was great, but I ordered & paid for 2 lbs.... received only 2 oz.  I have been unable to get any response from custom service.  There is no way to reach the company by phone.  I just put this credit card transaction into ""DISPUTED""!  :-(  :-(  :-(  I still want my 2 lbs.!"
2,Very difficult to work with - tends to turn to solid rock even when following directions - taste is less than desirable
5,"I am doing the ""subscribe and save"" thing with these crackers. I thought that it would take a while to get through the six boxes, but boy was I wrong. Already we're halfway through the boxes. Time to order more!"
5,The crackers are very tasty and we just tried them out with a little salsa on top for a healthy low cal snack and my wife and I absolutely love'em. We will definitely get more once we run out!
5,I loved this green tea with acai and grape added to it.  It made me feel awesome and gave me lots of energy!  I would recommend this tea to tea lovers who like a bit of an extra boost.  I think the acai extracts help a lot and made me feel wonderful.
4,Can't complain. Taste good and had quick delivery! It was my first time trying this tea out. I usually drink the peppermint one but this gave me energy and sustained me throughout the day.
3,"The product description says you are purchasing 6 boxes of 25 tea bags. I received only one box. I called amazon and they said that the quantity I received was correct and the description is wrong. They made it right, but shouldn't have had to. Beware!!"
5,"I would recommend this tea, it has a fresh taste with an amazing acai grape flavor that I have not had before.  It also gave me energy which I can always use!"
5,My husband and I found this rub in a little market in Philly a few years ago.  We have since purchased it religiously since.  It adds great flavor to steaks that now can't eat a steak without it.  It is definitely a must try!
5,"This steak rub is spectacular. I rub it liberally on steak (usually NY strip), let is sit for a while and then grill.  It has been getting rave reviews and we are already on our 3rd jar. I wish they would sell it in bigger jars. Amazon's price is a bit high though."
5,"This product is OK, I think it has too much sugar and the flavor is not that strong.<br />I enjoyed it, but did not meet my expectations."
5,Fabulous gift.  The blooming teas were lovely and unique.  Packaging was beautiful and perfect for a gift.
5,I bought this for my son who travels often - he's told me the thermos worked well & the blooming teas were good for 6 brews!
4,I am so happy to have bought this tumbler.  It is very handy to have around and works beautifully.  I whole-heartedly recommend this product to anyone looking for a convenient tea-making device.  I love the blooming bulbs and how you can see them while it brews! :)
5,Just be aware that it's quite expensive for the amount that you're getting (less than a pound of pasta per package).
1,"and the expiration date on top of the can says Jan.06,05. I cannot even return it since it is a grocery. Amazon, are you serious?"
5,This walnut oil is the best on the market. It has been roasted which enhances the walnut flavor. I love it with scrambled eggs and in preparing rice dishes. I've even used it to condition my hair! I completely trust Roland Foods because they are superior in every way.
4,"I purchased this to use on unfinished butcher block, which worked fine, but when I opened the first can the Delightful aroma from this oil had me making a walnut apple viinegret that was delicious."
5,This is oil is quite a good value compared to the grocery store prices.  We always keep a can in the refrigerator.
5,"I used this oil for a few years now for almost every recipe. It bakes really good in breads and it smells nice, and good in salads. Highly recommended."
5,"I prefer this to all other brands and types of coffee. Even after having lived in Italy, this is my favorite."
4,I use this for work. It's very quick and easy and much better than the vile coffee they provide.<br /><br />I don't understand the price though. A 2 oz jar at Whole Foods was $4.49 well before the exp. date.
1,"This is a good product, especially for iced coffee, but why is it twice the price as it is in stores?  This isn't a fluke--within the past two months I've bought it for $5 a jar in Seattle and in Nevada, so it just looks like good old-fashioned gouging.  Try harder Amazon."
5,This is a great product when in a hurry!  I'm surprised at the price though.  My store sells it for $3.49 bottle.  When I'm traveling I can usually find this at Mexican markets even cheaper.  I love Amazon - usually their products are less expensive than buying at stores.
5,"I am very fond of this coffee, and I won't accept substitutes for it. Several of my local stores have substituted another brand. I just order it on-line when I cannot get it in a store. HOWEVER, Amazon's price is too high. It's $4 a jar in local stores."
5,"I bought this from safeway for about $5. It's awesome in making those homemade iced caramel macchiatos that cost $4 at starbucks! :)<br /><br />(I don't know if it's just me, but it has this slight chocolatey aftertaste to it that's just absolutely divine)"
3,"This is really a normal taste coffee. I would not buy more after I finish this one. In fact, I will still be sleepy after drinking two cups!"
5,I bought this because none of the instant coffee was strong enough for me and was tired of waiting in line at Starbucks. I tried it and couldn't believe it! I am so hooked on this product and hope that my local grocery store continues to stock it.
5,"There's nothing like a cup of black (espresso) coffee to end a meal. I don't know why it's not on the super market shelves anymore. My favorite way of using it, however, is cold with plenty of ice on a hot summer's day."
5,"This is a great product, but $21 for 2oz. Really? You can get it from other sellers or at the grocery store for $6-7. Show this price-gouger what the market will really bear!"
5,It was what I was looking for.  I had a hard time finding expresso instant coffee.  A little expensive but oh well.
5,"I really love espresso. I cannot find it in the stores where I live so I have send for it.<br />Thank You,<br />Mary E Nevling"
5,"I love this item for cooking--it is especially good in brownies, cakes--and just a little bit in hot cocoa is wonderful."
5,"I am a coffee snob, and this is absolutely a greatest easy way to have excellent coffee. Got really tired of grinding beans everyday, now I discovered this!! And I am Italian, so I should know!!"
5,"I spotted the brand while watching ""Everyday Italian"" on the Food Channel. I drink it alone, as well as, adding it to brownies to make expresso brownies. Wonderful!"
1,Medaglia D'Oro has to be the worst coffee I've ever had. It had an old musty flavor and odor. You get what pay for.
5,"Love this coffee, good flavor. The large quantity lasts longer then the smaller boxes so I don't have to order as frequently. It did ship quickly too :) I would order again!"
3,Not quiet what I was expecting.  The cherries were dried and could not taste the brandy.  The dark chocolate was good but too crunchy.
5,Gravy could be a little thicker but the taste is great. The price isn't bad either. Makes great sailsbury steaks and stroganof.
5,"Great stuff! Wonderful beef taste, very smooth. Could be a little thicker so more of it would stay on top of the potatoes, but very good, and worlds better than other packaged gravies."
5,This sauce has one of the best flavors I've ever tasted.  There's a good balance between spice and garlic.  It has decent heat and tastes good on a lot of things.  I'm not a big fan of most Habanero sauces due to the extra bitterness of the pepper but this sauce blends everything perfectly.
5,"Roses Lime Juice has that lime flavor that the knock-offs do not have.  Roses has just the right amount of sugar so that it's not too sweet. Great for making any kind of gimlet...vodka, gin or even tequila (my favorite).  Since liquor is expensive don't settle for less than the ""Original"" !"
5,This is the only way to eat sashimi. The customer service is just outstanding!!! Thank you so much! Will do business with them soon.
3,Honestly these cookies could have been better. I would buy them again if the shipping wasn't so ridiculous! I think it ended up being like 15 dollars for a few tiny cookies. What a ripoff.
5,"These are the best gluten free cookies around. The Snicker doodles are also great! They are great to serve at parties or have for a snack. I wish they were a little cheaper, but they are worth it!"
5,This cookies are so good. There very close to my grandmothers home baked cookies but gluten free. This cookies are soft which I like in chocolate chip cookies but might be a little chew for some people I think there GREAT. Very happy.
5,"We love this coffee alone or mixed with caffeinated coffee. Our preference is for dark strong coffee, and this is both."
5,"This is great coffee, you cannot tell that it is decaf.  The flavor is just perfect, well balanced, not burned like Starbucks and makes good crema.  Works nicely with my Jura espresso-cappuccino machine.  I bought two four-packs already and going through my 6th jar at the moment."
4,"I've been using this coffee for several years and I am quite satisfied.  For a decaf, it is rich and satisfying, a robust taste for the early morning.  One of the best decaf coffees I've tasted."
4,"I would prefer to drink the regular Lavazza all the time,  but when I cannot handle the caffeine I use this.  It is a very good coffee."
5,I know nothing about this CO2 method of decaffeinating but thought I would give this a try. I usually buy the Swiss water processed. This had a wonderful chocolatey taste. It also claimed to be 99.9% caffein free. Hopefully this is all true because it really is the best I have tried of decaf.
5,Excellent quality product which reminds me of Italy... without the caffeine.  Perfect for after dinner without the effects of too much caffeine.
5,Very smooth and rewarding to have a decaff that does not bite the taste buds. Simply an enjoyable coffee. dz
5,"This espresso is delicious.  It's strong, but not too strong, and full-bodied and it's terrific for making cappuccino.  This brand is probably my favorite."
3,"This decaf is OK.  It is a Medium Roast, not a dark roast (says it on the can, but not in the description here).  Also, unlike another reviewer, I think that it is ground very fine."
5,I just used this to make myself an espresso and it was one of the best tastes of coffee that I've ever had.  I was absolutely surprised but it was sooo good.  I can't wait until the morning so I can have another cup (or two).  Yum!
3,"We've only used this once, but it kept us awake most of the night.  We were surprised because it's decaf, but we couldn't sleep for hours after going to bed.  Tastes good, though."
1,"I was hopeful, but left unsatisfied. The color of the bean grounds says it all; a light brown not the typical dark brown to black of real espresso, even decaf. Taste is weak and odd, not rich and solid. Certainly not worth the extra $$. Recommend Cafe Bustelo instead."
2,"t may be expresso grind, but if you are expecting lovely dark aromatic coffee for your espresso maker: think again. Bitter when drunk on own. Marginally better when combined with milk in cappuchino. I shoulda known betta!"
5,"The Jelly Belly people actually put real licorice in these jelly beans. There is usually only one of the licorice beans in a bag of assorted beans, so if you love licorice, you can buy them solo. These are authentic tasting and really good. You can't beat Jelly Belly for flavor."
5,"I have met the creator/inventor of the Jelly Belly and I can report with full confidence, that this is one tasty Licorice Jelly Bean.  A Jelly Belly is smaller than Jelly Beans and that is why Ronald Reagan liked them so much.  My personal favorite flavor is Licorice.  5 STARS!"
5,"Just because I sent an order of these jelly beans<br />to my oldest son in Roswell, Georgia.  He travels<br />a lot and enjoys a snack while he is driving and<br />he loves licorice jelly beans.<br /><br />This would make a nice gift for any special person<br />in your life."
5,"Baby loves this flavor and great because all organic and no crap in it. I give this to her breakfast lunch or dinner, not just for morning."
5,It is not cheap... probably a little overpriced... but very high quality ingredients. NO meat by products
3,"I was thinking of purchasing these Oakcakes.  However, in reading the ingredients, I don't see Oats listed. Are these Oakcakes without Oats?<br /><br />Wheat Flour, Vegetable Oils, Sugar, Wheat Bran, Invert Sugar Syrups, Salt, Skimmed Milk Powder, Raising Agent"
2,"We tried this formula because it is lactose free, my baby does not have any other issues, just lactose intolerant.<br />We found that it smells bad, does not mix well into water and my baby would not drink a drop."
5,"My baby hasn't died yet.<br /><br />If your baby has food allergies and your doctor prescribes this stuff... and you love your baby, it's certainly worth every penny. As expected, my daughter is still alive and she's doing well."
5,"These are the best chocolate chips I've ever tasted in my life.  Yes, they are pricey but it doesn't matter because they last forever and you use about half the amount of the regular ones due to the richness of them.  So so so good.  If you love chocolate, you will love these chips."
5,"Judy's makes the best sugar free candy available.  So many sugar free candies are overloaded with aspertane, and that has its side and after effects.  These don't."
5,We found these sugar-free caramels to be luxuriously delicious! a pinch of sea salt heightenes the buttery sweet flavor.<br />Price is a little high but worth it for the quality!
5,The quality of this tea is 5 star-it is in sealed bags. We're trying it out to see if helps our nails & skin.
3,"These steaks came out really good, but the bacon doesn't have much flavor and doesn't seem to add to the steaks.  The size of the steaks are perfect though and I would recommend it unless you are looking for a lot of bacon flavor."
5,"After purchasing these steaks for myself. I found then to be so easy to store and very tasty when BBQ'd. I decided to share them with my family and friends as gifts, they just loved them."
5,"My grandchildren LOVE the sour gummy vitamins. They really liked the sour gummy worms by Rhino, but alas, I can't find them. These were a good second choice. The big problem is keeping them from eating more than 2!"
5,"I was glad to know that amazon has this product in their groceries section.<br />Though the shipping was individually priced, don't know whether there was any option to pack the glass jars.<br />Anyway, I liked the fast service."
5,"From taste to texture, Bionaturae makes the best pasta I have ever eaten. I will never buy cheap grocery store brand pasta again."
5,"I have a geriatric mini poodle.  He can't chew biscuits or rawhide textures,but these treats are soft enough and still provide some workout for his gums and remaining teeth.<br />I appreciate the fact that the ingredients are domestic and it is manufactured in the US."
5,My golden retriever loves them. You can chop them into squares if you want smaller treats.
5,"These are not the tough, durable jerky that I was expecting, but small, soft, chewy squares.  They break up easily into tiny BB sized balls (maybe 12 per square) and my puppies will do ANYTHING for them! Best dang training aide on the market!"
5,"My Murphy (soft-coated wheaten terrier) loves these treats.  They are his ""special"" treat that brings him back in a heated run when we call him!"
5,"Our dogs love these healthy treats. I like them because they have no wheat, corn or soy in them. The soft squares make a nice sized treat for our little girls. Notice that the first ingredient is lamb, an uncommon luxury for a dog treat."
4,"These treats are one of my dog's favorites! I like this company, they make a lot of great treats, and the ingredients are from the U.S."
5,"Ernie, my pooch, LOVES these treats.  He'll do trick or command just to get his Zuke!<br />Seriously, these things will make your dog do anything....so, buy two bags!"
5,"Great product, I am new to the brand but have fallen in love with these products. Not as soft as one reviewer states to replace a pill pocket. Very hard to findbin stores, so the best place to buy is here."
5,My dog loves these treats in all varieties.  They are easy to break in half as well.  The resealable bag is a plus.
3,If your dog likes Naked bars then this is the same consistency. It's hard and sometimes my dog will eat it sometimetimes he'll just leave it. It's quite hard.
5,Great! I have a dog who is very allergic to lots of stuff and this is safe for him because of no grain corn wheat etc....  the dogs love the taste  I use them for training<br />...
4,This is a good product with great price.  I received the treat and was very pleased with the product and package.
5,My dog is a service dog and she is kind of out in the woods lots so this is a very good training tool and treat Plus I can share them with other dog's if I see fit
5,My dog lives for these treats!  Can't wait to see us leave in the morning when I give him a few.
1,"We have two cats and four dogs. The cats seemed to like this treat but the dogs turned up their noses at it. One of them, a Chiweenee, eats just about everything and he would not touch it. He tried it and left it laying on the floor."
5,"They smell rather smokey, so I wasn't sure my dogs would like them.  They are rather particular.  But they love them.  Just re-ordered more!"
5,"My Boston terrier loves these!  They are great Kong toy fillers.  Besides being tasty, they are made in America... and they are nourishing.  Highly recommend!"
5,My dog loves Zuke's treats and this one is no acceptation. He did not like them as much as the chicken but they still keep his interest. I will be cutting them up to use at puppy class. Zukes are the only thing other than hotdogs that will get his attention.
4,"I use this to train my dog and while he is a picky snacker, he usually likes these. They go a longer way too since I break them into pieces."
5,I am impressed with the quality of these dog treats.  Amazon seems to sell these treats for the best price and I will continue to order these in the future.  My dog really likes the lamb variety and they smell very good.  I reccommend these to any animal lover!
5,"These are great treats!, love that these are all natural!  Plus my puppy loves the size of them easy for him to eat"
5,"This is very good dog treat. Our Chihauhua loves them. It is her favorite. They are semisoft,so the older dogs with few teeth can enjoy them."
5,"Our two dogs just love these treats.  One old and one younger but both are active.  The older dog's teeth aren't the best. These treats are easy for him to chew.  It seems like the younger one swallows them whole he's so eager to get them!  Oh, and watch your fingers too:)"
5,Dogs love 'em!!  I mix the treats in their dog food and they wolf it down within a minute.
5,What more can I ask for? Great ingredients and my dog loves these. She'll do back flips for em.. very good. great price too.
5,These treats are probably the healthiest treat I've ever given my dogs! They smell so good I actually want to try them (but haven't done it.....yet!). My 3 dogs absolutely love them.
4,"These treats are all natural so I feel good about rewarding my one year old yellow labrador, and she appears to really enjoy the size and the texture as well as the taste of ZUKE'S."
5,"My 2 doxies have liked everything that Zukes makes...however, I think the lamb jerky is their favorite...nice and smelly, just what a dog wants."
5,"Labs aren't known to be picky eaters (gross understatement, I know) but wow, these Zuke's are at the top of their ""we'll do anything, just please can we have one"" list.  No toxic stuff in them, either."
5,My Miniature Schnauzer just loves these treats! That's the best review I can give doggy treats.
5,I had a really picky dog who refuses any kind of biscuit type treat offered to him.  He eats some soft treats and loves these.
5,My minature schnauzer loves these treats!  I sometimes get the mini treats in chicken so I can give him a few throughout the day or on walks - I do not want him to get overweight since he is a small boy.  I would highly recommend them:)
5,My dog loves these snacks and they don't have artificial ingredients.<br /><br />They come in a resealable bag which is good - they do get a bit hard if they are not kept sealed up.
5,"Our Bischon Loves these treats, so does our cat! And we love that they have fresh fruits and veggies in them! Yeah!"
5,"My dog will do just about anything for this treat. Also, each treat can be cut easily into for small pieces for training. Ingredients listed are good quality. I had no ill effects from giving to my dog. Beef was the flavor I purchased this time"
5,"My Min Pin, Snickers seems to enjoy the heck out of these small treats. They are the perfect size for his tiny little mouth. Thank you."
5,"These treats went over really well with our three dogs. They're about 1 inch square pieces, so they're a good size for our larger dogs. I also really like that they have high quality ingredients and don't give our dogs the smellies like Milkbones do."
5,My dogs go crazy when they smell these.  They are great for training too.  I put them in their kong toys also and that keeps them busy for a while.
5,Well my dog seems to like these very much.  Let's see if someone can offer free shipping on these.
1,Under the product features it says all meats are sourced in the USA. I got the Lamb and Rice jerky today and it says on the package the Lamb comes from New Zealand. That's a huge misrepresentation of this product on the product page. Very disappointed.
2,"My chihuahuas like this treat, but they do not eat it with enthusiasm. They hesitate and let it sit quite often."
5,These are nice little training treat sized cookies that can easily be gobbled by my 50 and 75lb dogs.  I imagine they'd work good too for the smaller dogs as a more regular sized treat.  They are about the size of a nickel each.
5,"Very light in taste, but very giood, ty! Also, very fast service! I really enjoyed this prodect! I would order this again! Ty!"
5,We always drink Timmothy's or Emeril's. Thought we would try something different. Not too many decafs to choose from. We were pleasantly surprised that this had a great taste with a full bodied flavor. I like my coffee on the milder side so I can even get 2 cups from 1 Kcup.
4,Good subtle flavored coffee for the mid-afternoon pick me up. A bit of sweetness without being overdone. Wish it was available in whole bean as I like it stronger then the Keurig cup can make it.
2,This coffee brews very weak - like a light roast.  W.P. Chef's reserve pods are just over half full.  Put pod on scale and it's 15% less coffee wgt than normal pods.  Stick with normal pods or extra bold if you like coffee that taste like coffee.
1,"This is a good decaf coffee, but I've never before had a k cup dump the contents into my cup. It's extremely irritating to deal with grounds in the cup and machine when deliberately choosing a system that avoids the mess."
2,Warning: this is a STRONG flavor.<br /><br />I thought that this would be Blue Mountain-y... oh no. It is like... rum flavored or something. Yuk.
5,I admit I don't usually drink decaf but this is a favorite in my office and I felt it deserved a good rating.
3,"With so many choices now, I thought I woudl give this a try.<br />The Donut shop Decaf is by far my favorite and this one falls short."
3,Very good tasteing product but I need to use it the smallist setting on my B-60 to really enjoy the depth.
5,"I am still waiting for Peets to come out with Kcups, but in the meantime, the Wolfgang Puck's coffees are filling the bill. I really like Sorrento AND Rodeo Drive---smooth and full bodied.<br />JS"
5,"Not too bold, not too weak...not bitter.  Good way to start if your not into the real strong coffees.  My husband and I have added the Wolfgang Puck ""Breakfast in Bed"" line and the ""Rodeo Drive"" flavors to our buying ritual."
3,"This flavored K-Cup isn't out of this world, but isn't horrible. In my opinion, it's way more flavorful than the Wolfgang Puck Hazelnut K-Cup. We love flavored coffee in our house, and so I would go with this one again. Worth a try."
4,"Never had Hawaiian Hazelnut before so I didn't know what to expect, but it turns out it's pretty good, not as flavored as say DD, but nonetheless pretty good. I have it on subscription now along with the German Chocolate Cake, another one of my favorite flavored K-cups."
5,"This has made me into a coffee lover!  Very  mild and easy on the stomach, but with a great flavor.  Love it!"
4,"Nice, light cup of coffee. Definitely not a bold brew but it's smooth and gentle on the stomach.....good for those mornings when you over did it the night before. Would buy again."
5,This is a very balanced and smooth light coffee great for a first cup of the day.
5,This is a great cup of hazelnut coffee; smooth and balanced with no chemical aftertaste.  My husband and I like it so much that we've ordered it twice directly from the Keurig manufacturer.  SO GLAD that it's now available on Amazon through subscribe and save!
1,No where in the description does it mention that this is a flavored coffee.  By the name I thought it was a Jamaican Blue Mountain blend but its flavored with a weak tasting hazelnut.  Not very good
1,I was in a hurry and did not read the reviews...I trusted amazon's description and it did NOT indicate it was flavored coffee and that it was NOT Jamaican...it is very lightly flavored with vanilla so it isnt too bad. I feel cheated.
2,I drink about 4 to 6 cups of coffee every morning - I'm always looking for a new flavor - so I gave it a try - I drank it but I would not order again. steve
5,Rodeo Drive is my absolute favorite and I'm ready to order more!  That's if I can find it.<br />I don't know why they are discontinuing it.<br />It arrived very fast.
4,"The Breakfast In Bed coffee from Wolfgang Puck is  a good medium roast coffee.  My husband, the regular coffee drinker of our house, likes it, but feels he would like the coffee more if it were a bit stronger.  The product arrived quite soon after ordering."
5,"The Wolfgang Puck Coffee, Chef's Reseerve Columbian Decaf is fantastic and very delicious.  I definitely recommend this product to anyone who wants a great cup of coffee."
5,Nice round flavor. Not harsh or botter. I enjoy it with French Vanilla creamer.  Lately it has been harder to find.  I do hope they have not discontinued it!
1,"Coffee tastes great, but the cups get torn apart when brewing.  What a mess that is!!  I am quite disappointed because I do like this flavor of coffee!!"
5,This is my wife's favorite. She grew up in Seattle and has consumed countless gallons of various types of coffee in her lifetime so I assume this is good coffee. She is also my wine taster as her palate is much more sensitive than mine.
2,"I tried this product solely for the fact it has Wolfgang's name on it.  I should have stuck with Timothy's brand.  This was way too strong to be labeled a breakfast coffee, more like a dinner coffee.  I will not be buying this again, also way too expensive compared to the others."
5,"Love this coffee, but cannot buy it through regular outlets, so am gouged by SASA Corner. Really sticks in my craw paying more than a buck a cup."
5,"We were given a Keurig for a wedding present, along with several variety packs. So far, Wolfgang Puck's Jamaica Me Crazy is our favorite, and we will definitely be repeat buyers of this flavor."
5,"This is my favorite late evening cup of coffee.  Nice flavor, just right before retiring for the night. Keep stocking this brand and I will keep coming back for it!!"
5,It's a great flavor and makes a great cup of coffee. I fine you can have more than 1 cup of this coffee and not feel like it's too much of a flavored coffee. Puck has captured a great flavor with this coffee.
1,"It sure would be nice if they stated ANYWHERE in the description of this coffee that it is flavored.  I love the Bed and Breakfast coffee, it's just plain coffee, so I was surprised when I received the Jamaica coffee and it was flavored.  YUCK!"
1,"I ordered 3 boxes of 18 each.............and opened one box to find they were PODS and not<br />for Keurig, AND I can't return them!!!?????  Yes,the pods fit into the Keurig but<br />the end product is weak and awful.  I am most disappointed"
5,I love the Wolfganag Puck flavors.  This Vienna blend is very nice.  It is medium roast so it is not too strong.  Has a wonderful flavor without being a flavored coffee.  One of my favorites.
5,We purchased an assorted package of K-Cups (by various makers) and of all the coffees THIS is my FAVE!  I really can't see any reason to ever taste-test another flavor!  It smells delicious and TASTES DELICIOUS too!!
2,"The coffee is good. However, at least half of these haven't been sealed correctly. When I brew them the edge of the foil pops open and coffee grounds go everywhere. Not fun to clean. It may have just been the batch we got, but I won't be ordering these again."
5,"Never got a delivery as fast as we did this time.  We were running low on our special coffee. We have sampled many K-cup coffees, some in assorted packs and decided this is the best.  It is mellow, never bitter and always totally enjoyable."
5,"This is my second favorite after the breakfast in bed flavor. I love Wolfgang Puck coffee. It's a little bolder then the breakfast in bed, but still smooth."
5,this is just the perfect thing to end a tired day.  the taste is smooth and warm and creamy.  i find that i look forward to having a cup while i read for a few minutes. what a treat.
4,This is good vanilla coffee.  I got this and the green mountain and prefer this one.  It has a nice sweet flavor
5,"Wolfgang Puck Hawaiian Hazelnut Coffee for Keurig brewer.  Good medium strength coffee with Hazelnut flavor. Full-body, enjoyable anytime of the day. I really like this coffee."
4,"Coffee quality is as good as expected but, close to expiring. Next time, I will spend the extra few dollars and buy the coffee localy."
5,"If you like a balanced cup of joe, this is a great choice. The coffee is smooth and balanced. There is no bitterness or bite. Thank you Chef Puck for this fantastic decaf coffee choice!"
5,"Smooth with a hint of flavor.  Medium boldness yet rich in taste.  Not a ""wake me up"" but certainly enjoyable!"
5,My second purchase of this  cofee & like the first cup it has been wonderful to wake up to.  Not too bold or brash but a good drink to start the day with
5,"The best thing that I look foreward to every morning . It makes my day ,the best tasting coffee ever"
4,I really enjoy this one and I've tried many! In my top 5. A little pricey but will order again sometime in the future.
5,"Jamaica Me Crazy is an awesome smooth coffee, Light Coconut/Vanilla flavorful taste.<br />a good coffee if you don't like real strong coffee.Highly recommend."
5,"Smooth, delicious, can't wait to wakeup with my coffee! I love all the Wolfgang Puck coffee flavors...never a dull flavor!"
5,This is our first time trying the Wolfgang Puck coffee - so glad we did!!!  It is a wonderful medium blend and great for any time of day!  I would buy it again!
5,This is the best k cup coffee that we have been able to find.  Very rich flavors and a medium + roast.  We love this one!
5,I loved this brand.  It was the best vanilla flavor of others I tried.  I would buy more if it was a better price.
5,"Fantastic taste, smooth ""feel"", no nasty aftertaste, pairs great with creamer. What more can one want from a coffee? This has become my favorite."
5,Best flavored k cup I've ever had! I recommend this for everyone. Great flavor! I've given it to all my friends and they get hooked.
5,"I didn't know what this would taste like, but I'm so glad I ordered it.  What a perfect cup of yummy coffee for a cool summer morning!"
5,"Wake up to a cup of Wolfgang Puck Coffe Breakfast in Bed (medium Roast) K-cup for Keurig. is a great way to start your day, or just sit down and relax. Try it and you will be buying more.<br /><br />Shop Amazon for Wolfgang Puck Coffee, Breakfast in Bed"
5,This is a favorite in the office and in my house. We burn through this coffee. I've tried a few of the other Wolfgang coffees and this one is by far the best. I've seen better prices for this at a lot of other places. This is an excellent coffee to start your day with.
1,"Didn't realize it was flavored and thought, when I had my first sip, that it tasted like chemicals. F-. Gave it away the next day at work."
3,"Good, but the Green Mountain reserve Sumatra is better by 1- 1 and a half stars. Sort of tastes a little stale."
5,Wonderful flavor would purchase this blend of coffee again light flavor not bitter at all and price was great the best I found anywhere
5,I find many of the K cups are a bit bitter for my taste.  I want something simple and smooth.  This coffee is wonderful!
4,Not much of a coffee drinker but this Wolfgang Vienna brand is good. Not strong but a mellow taste.  The flavored coffees are getting on my nerves and this is just a good everyday coffee flavor. Everyone in the family and visitors like it. Would buy again.
5,I truly enjoy a good cup of coffee. It does give me a lift in the morning. Wolfgang Puck really knows how to produce a fine cup. Thanks.
4,"great service and delivery for a really good product. i am constantly looking for a good hazelnut coffee and so far this is the best, along with green mountain..."
5,"My family is full of coffee snobs.  If you like robust coffee and use k-cups, this is the product for you."
5,My favorite Flavored coffee!!! This is not available in any of my local stores.  Better price than I have found at any local stores as well.
5,"If you liked flavored coffees, this one has a hint of coconut to it.  This is my favorite coffee by far. I look forward to my first cup every morning."
5,I love this coffee. Great taste and great way to start your morning. If you like flavored coffee you will like this.
5,"These K-Cups are great! The coffee is mild and yummy, but still very flavorful. I love this, cant wait to get my next shipment!"
1,This flavor is horrible.  There are many other flavors much better.  Hawaiian Hazelnut is great!  Breakfast in Bed is AWesome!
5,"This is great coffee.  I am a coffee purist.  I don't add cream or sugar (unless it is weak or bitter). I truly enjoy coffee.  I have tried many different types of coffee for K-cups.  This is my new favorite. The price was amazing too.  Very smooth and subtle hazelnut flavor, not overpowering."
5,"Take it from someone who was tried a lot of different K-cups, BUY THESE! The ""Breakfast in Bed"" blend is full of great flavor, roasted perfectly, and more importantly I have been choosing it over Green Mountain, which says a lot. It's true to its name, perfect for the morning."
3,"I like dark strong coffee but I just didn't really care for this one.  Not sure what it really was, almost a tad bitter?  Unfortunately I have another whole box of 24 to use up.  I picked up some Sumatran Reserve (also a dark) and prefer it."
5,"I have tried many different k-cups and this has remained my favorite for the longest time. It is the perfect balance, not too weak and not too bold. And since I usually drink my coffee black, the flavor alone is very important to me. It' has a great flavor and not too acidic."
3,"If you like your flavored coffee to taste like coffee, this may not be for you.  I couldn't taste the coffee at all in the travel size brew, but the smaller brew sizes were a bit better."
5,"Amazon had this as buy one get one free and since it was my favorite, I could not resist.  Great purchase."
5,"this product is great tasting and you don't even need sugar or creamer, but if you like sweet coffee i'd say a little sugar and creamer would not hurt, this is a perfect product to wake up to every morning :)"
5,This coffee is so smoothe.  I brew my morning cup with the medium cup size and it is delicious. It is a little weak on the large cup size setting.
4,"This is a smooth not bitter coffee. It's a little more pricey than some which are just as good, but it has a good sweet flavor, and I can recommend it."
5,I bought a small 3 pack of this locally and liked it so much I bought the 48 pack.  Great deal on Amazon.
5,Bought a sample pack today of the Jamaica Me Crazy and love the flavor.  The flavor is not too powerful nor was it  overwhelming.  I'd recommend the Wolf Gang Puck k-cups.
5,"This is the smoothest and best tasting Keurig coffee I've tried.  It's not bitter, not too weak, not too strong, just right!"
5,"These are awesome...as are all of Wolfgang Puck's k-cups. The coffee is smooth, the cups brew perfectly, the taste is unbelievable! My husband and I are hooked on these. The price is great considering what amazing coffee this is!!"
5,WOLFGANG PUCK'S FRENCH ROAST HAS A DEEP ROBUST FLAVOR. I PREFER IT IN THE AFTERNOON... SOMETIMES WITH A SHOT OF GRAN MARNIER... OH YEAH...
4,"This one is my wife's favorite of all the Hazlenut blends she has tried. This is her ""go to"" after a busy day of being retired.<br />Delivery was exceptional as usual, could not ask for much more."
5,"I drink my coffee black,so quality is a must! This is an excellent medium roast with a smooth consistency and perfect amount of kick. I love all the Wolfgan Puck coffee k-cups, but this is absolutely my favorite!"
5,I drink a lot of coffee and I buy several different types. I found this particular one to be pleasant tasting with a nice aroma while brewing. There is no after-taste so you always want another cup.
5,"Wonderful tasty coffee with a nice aroma as it is brewing. There is no after-taste at all and it very satisfying, you always want another cup of coffee. I continue to buy it."
5,A very nice flavor with no after-taste. It gives off a nice fragrance while brewing and has a very satisfying taste. You have to have another cup!
4,"Dark and full flavored, but distinctly Columbian.  This is a great morning coffee. Better cup of AM Joe than you will get at a coffee place."
5,"My favorite of the Wolfgang series discovered when trying all of the flavors in the available sample pack. Very good flavor, consistent with each pod and not overdone with added flavors. Very good dark roast Colombian cup of coffee from the Wolf."
5,We have tried all of the Hazelnut flavored coffee brands.  This is by far the best.  To bad it isn't an auto ship.
5,"I've tried lots of flavors of coffee and this one is my favorite! Great taste, not bitter at all. A great flavored coffee for people who don't really like the taste of coffee."
5,"the aroma is awesome!!  love the flavor, really gets you going in the morning.  prompt delivery, this is definatly my husbands favorite single cup coffee"
4,"After 5 years with the Keurig, this is the best .  If you like a medium blend, it perfect.  Its smooth, and has taste. Not watered down on either setting."
5,Wolfgang Puck makes the BEST coffee! The package arrived on time and in perfect condition! I would definitely order this again.
5,Have enjoyed every single cup of Breakfast in Bed. Just the right kind of brew to wake up these old bones and get me started on the day's adventure. Also enjoy it while watching NCIS so I can join Gibbs enjoying a brew as well.
5,I love this coffee - it's one of my all time favorites - it has the best flavor and I like the light roast.<br /><br />EXCELLENT!!!!
3,"I love my Keurig but haven't found my ""perfect"" cup of coffee yet, although this comes close. I prefer a medium brew, not bold or strong. Breakfast in Bed is my choice so far."
5,Truly not much needs to be said because it's Wolf and to wake up to his coffee here at the house is fantastic!
4,"I expected more flavor from W. Puck. Though this coffee does taste good, it didn't have caramel flavor as expected. This is my opinion. Someone else may feel differently. The price is okay, I would not discount this product at all. It's a good product. Try it, you may like it."
5,I've tried all Vanilla coffee K-cups and by far this is the best! Wolf Gang Puck Vanilla Francaise is a smooth vanilla experience that lasts way after the coffee is consumed.  Try it you'll love it!
5,"I am not a huge coconut fan, so I wasn't excited about trying this, but with one sip it definitely won me over!  The flavor is perfect and is now one of the flavors in our regular rotation.  And it smells so good!!!"
5,This is my daughter's favorite K-cup product. Mild medium roast it is the next best thing to having Wolfgang cooking breakfast for you in your kitchen.
5,"I'm sure this flavor isn't for everyone, but if you enjoy your coffee on the sweeter and more flavorful side then you should enjoy this. It is not what I would call a ""strong"" coffee by any means. I would describe it as mild and flavorful."
4,"I was really impressed with this coffee, it has a nice bold taste, yet a smooth<br /> finish. I would order this coffee again."
5,This is my absolute favorite coffee flavor out there!  I'm so glad it comes in K-Cups!  And I'm glad it is so inexpensive!
5,I find this particular brand as good as the local coffee shop coffee (D.D.) which is a compliment to the maker. I have made this particular brand my #1 choice.
5,"I normally drink only Donut Shop, but when I saw this on sale I thought I would give it a try.  I was quite impressed with it and really enjoy this one.  I have now added it to my list of favorite K-cups to buy."
2,"Vanilla flavor is barely noticeable.  Acidic taste, not at all what I expected.  Breakfast in Bed and Hawaiian Hazelnut are much better choices."
5,I really like the flavor of this one! It has a low acidity but still full of flavor! Now I have to have it every morning and I am having trouble finding another one I like this much.
5,"This is the best tasting coffee available on k-cups!!!! The flavor is amazing, it is more expensive than other brands, but for a reason. Definitely worth trying."
5,This is one of the best coffees I have ever had for my Keurig.  It is a nice smooth coffee.  And the price is the best price I could find.  I will be buying more.
5,My husband and I are obsessed with this coffee...we take Kcups and hide them around the house because we wanna make sure it lasts a long time! Such a bold and delicious flavor!
5,"I had tried this coffee before, it is wonderful.  Smooth and rich, full flavored, but not too bold. I would recommend it to anyone."
3,"The coffee is good,however the k-cup is not packaged well,the coffee machine barely streams coffee,more of a fast drip.  The whole idea is it's fast,right?"
5,"It was a bit of a risk to order this, I mean what are you going to do with 2 boxes of kcups that taste terrible? But this was delish, the flavor was really good, and it was still awesome after it had cooled down. It has a coconutty, vanilla flavor, very nice!!"
4,"I like the Jamaica Me Crazy better, but when it's out of stock, this is my second choice.<br /><br />It's got a nice flavor & strength, without being bitter."
5,"This is my favorite KCup.  I'd describe it as medium-dark, creamy and rich.  And very consistent.  A lot of k-cups seem acidic to me, so i'm really glad i found this one. :]"
5,"Very delicious coffee, thankfully Amazon sells this flavor now.  I have been waiting for it since I tasted this last year.  I like the fact that you sell it in a 2 Pack rather than a single."
5,"Delicious coffee, good medium blend.  Its hard to find something that isnt too weak or too bold with K-cups, but this flavor was perfect.  Will buy again."
5,"Good flavor.  Coconut flavor is subtle and not overpowering.  In comparison, there is another coconut coffee by Green Mountain in which the coconut flavor is overdone in my opinion."
2,"While good quality, it was not at all what I expected. It smelled like caramel and vanilla, but it tasted like straight black coffee. I was pretty disappointed."
3,"The coffee is just OK, a little weak. The price is a little high and it is not worth the extra money."
2,I was surprised to find out how weak this coffee is.  It has a good flavor but even on half cup it is very weak.
5,"To me, this has a good, balanced flavor.  Some flavored K-cups seem too light on hazelnut, or too light on coffee.  This one is just right."
4,This k-cup actually smelled up the office. And it tastes as good as it smells. I found it to be very flavorful.
5,"Light and flavorful definitely describes this K-Cup. I often find it hard to find flavored K-Cups that aren't either 1) so strong you lose the flavor or 2) so light you'd be better off drinking water. However, I have to admit I have found a new favorite in the Hawaiian Hazelnut!"
5,Best K cup around. A must try!  Amazon ships quickly and in one piece. I'd recommend the coffee as well as going through Amazon to order this coffee from.  Thank you for a great experience.
4,Usually do not get the breakfast blends but it was on sale and decided at price would try it out. It was not as weak as some breakfast blends tend to be. Not bad.
4,Wolfgang Puck definitely has the best coffee for the money.  I absolutely love the French Vanilla.  The KCup actually makes a good full cup of coffee.  it could be a tad stronger but overall it is really good.  I still prefer the Senseo Pods to the KCups though.
4,"Jamaica Me Crazy has a slight overtone of cinnamon that is a very nice compliment to the taste of coffee.  The flavoring is strong enough to taste, not just smell, without overpowering the flavor of the coffee.  Very good."
5,I drink my coffee with a splash of half-and-half.  Other hazelnut k-cups are too bland for me.  I much prefer Wolfgang Puck's excellent rich roast with definite -- but not overpowering -- hazelnut flavor.
3,Too bad no one else had reviewed this before my purchase. It's not bold or dark enough to stand up to the Keurig's 3rd button and tasted a little tangy for my liking.
5,"This coffee says medium roast but is actually a little stronger.  We loved it and it has become our favorite.  If you want some coffee to ""caffeine you up"", this is the one for you!!  Also, Wolfgang Puck's Breakfast in Bed is great...not so strong!"
4,"This is very good coffee, but it doesn't have as much flavor as the Van Houttes creme caramel.  If your looking for something that has a lot of flavor, go with the other.  If you are looking for something that is more coffee than flavor, this is it."
4,"By far,this is the best flavored K cup coffee I've ever had. Good body, not bitter, no flowery aroma (like with the Green Mountain flavored K cups). I like my coffee a little stronger than Puck's Hawaiian Hazelnut, but it is certainly a fine, medium bodied,coffee I could drink over and over."
5,These K cups are wonderful! We were pleasantly surprised with the low acidity and smooth flavor! The Rodeo Drive K cups are on our top five K Cup list!
5,Bought this during one of Amazon's Friday Sales.  Did not find too many reviews since these are fairly new.  Took a chance and am very pleased.  We like our coffee rich and strong and this one delivers.  Great tasting dark roast coffee!
2,"I personally did not care for the coffee, too mild for me and a little ""nutty"" flavor in it.  I will stick with Tully's Kona and House blends, also Emeril's Big Easy bold."
5,Exact same as the ones bought at the store only a lot cheaper. Recommended for any Keurig drinkers out there.
5,This is my #1 favorite coffee. Blending of hazelnut and coconut are perfect.  Thank you!!<br /><br />Question:  why was I charged postage on this brand when I have never paid on any other brand of K-Cups from Amazon
5,If you like your Keurig you need to try this K-cup.  Smooth taste with just a slight hint of flavor.  Not overwhelming like some brands.  My new favorite.
5,"This is our favorite k-cup coffee, it is strong - and taste great (although it seems that many of the k-cups) have nearly the same overall taste..."
3,"More than a ""hint"" of coconut! Not very much vanilla. Being a vanilla fan and NOT a coconut fan - this is OK."
4,"This is a good tasting K-cup from a guy who drinks coffee black and prefers a bold, full flavored taste. I would recommend."
5,"I love using K Cups!  Although I have tried so many ""bad"" coffees.  I have finally hit on one dark roast coffee that isn't bitter and has a wonderful flavor.  You don't have to try them all, this is a perfect blend coffee."
5,"Ok - so this is the best flavored coffee ever.  No after taste that seems to always occur w/flavored coffees & its not even really flavored, it has hint of coconut taste but it really still tastes like coffee just the best coffee ever... mmmmmm... add honey.. yummy!!!!!<br />Highly recommend!"
4,Wolfgang puck k cups are under the radar - their coffees are smooth and delicious and Jamaica Me Crazy is my fav and the best coconut flavored coffee on the market. Island coconut is quite poor in comparison.
5,"I've always hated the Peete's or Starbucks burnt-bitter taste. This is a great blend, still strong without the burn roasting.<br /><br />FYI, low quality beans are burned to hide it's bad taste."
5,"I like the darker roast coffees and this fits the bill.  This is every bit as good as Deidrich and Tulley's but typically costs more.  I guess Wolkgang wants a cut.  If you catch it on sale, buy it."
3,"This coffee is a lot like the Green Mountain Nantucket blend.  If you like that, you'll like this.  Generally, the GM product costs less, but this was on sale."
5,"It was as good, if not better, than I was told!  Great taste!  I will puchase it again."
1,"...I will drink this if all other coffee options are exhausted. The coffee has a vanilla/coconut smell but after a sip or two, I can't drink it. Would not purchase again and I'm having trouble even giving it away. I expected more from Wolfgang Puck."
1,"I love caramel and was excited when this arrived. But I AM SO DISAPPOINTED. Hardly any flavor at all, of coffee or caramel"
5,This is an excellent full-bodied coffee without a bitter taste. In general the Wolfgang Puck coffees are quite good although a little more expensive than some of the other K-Cups.
5,"As always, I LOVE this coffee, it's about the only kind I buy for myself.  The turn around time is terrific.  When I have about a week's worth of cups left, I order and have the next batch in perfect timing.  Very happy with everything about this product."
5,"This coffee is a smooth, yet robust taste that does not have any bad after<br />taste. <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B003VXJJ28"">Wolfgang Puck Coffee, Rodeo Drive Blend (Medium Roast), 24-Count K-Cups for Keurig Brewers (Pack of 2)</a>"
5,"Sometimes we have a problem ordering the k-cups because they are way too strong for us--even if you order medium blend.  This coffee was great--just right!  It was a smooth blend, and was perfect for a morning cup of coffee--or anytime!  Would definitely order again!"
5,"Good description of this product. Has the over roasted popular coffee flavor, but, not overpowering. One of my favorites so far."
5,I ordered this by accident and I'm so happy I did. This is a new favorite of mine. It's nice and strong without being bitter.
3,"It's coconut flavored, either you'll like it or not.  I was actually surprised since I'm not a big fan of coconut, but I liked this coffee.  Not my favorite, but nice on occasion."
5,"My friend says she loves this coffee and has never been able to find it in the local stores where we live.  Aha, she did not know that Amazon sells just about anything you could want - no tax and free shipping.  What could be better."
4,"hazelnut being the household favorite favorite, I thought I'd give these k-cups a try. The flavor is smooth and delightful. I suggest trying this brand for your k-cup machine!"
4,"This is good, but could be a bit stronger in the Hazelnut flavor. It is good though and I would purchase it again."
1,I love the taste but have found that many of the cups explode!!  The glue on the side of the cup becomes undone and then the cup explodes.  Very hard to clean up.  Do not think I will buy this brand again!
5,"I love Jamaica Me Crazy coffee. This version is flavorful, the price is pretty good, and it sure beats the office pot coffee that sits on a burner for hours. Fresh coffee, fast!"
3,"This is less of a ""bold"" flavor and more of an acidic and bitter coffee. My wife is easy to please and she's not a fan. I'll finish the box but I reach of others first."
5,"This coffee has become one of my daily favorites.  It's not quite as strong as many of the french roasts, but it's also not as bitter.  A good way to start the day."
5,"I have had all of the various Keurigs since they came on the market for home use. Thus,I have tried pretty near all of the various k-cups. This is one of my top 5 favorites. Love the coconut in it, and the wonderful coffee flavor. YUM!!!!"
4,This coffee was not what I expected but enjoyed it greatly.  I was looking for a stronger vanilla flavor but after trying it I enjoyed it a lot. It was light and smooth and left no aftertaste.  I would recommend this to others.
4,"I like Columbian coffee and this is above average with a good dark color with a nice smell.  The taste is bolder than average but not unpleasant or bitter.  This is my ""strong"" Columbian coffee combining all the good things of the type with a bolder taste."
4,smooth.  I normally drink dark roasts but purchased this on a lightning deal (or maybe a friday sale).  I like it.
3,"The coffee is just OK. It's very mild, almost bordering on weak. Would buy it again if the price was right."
5,I've tried every bold k-cup and this is one is one of my favorites.  Very nice flavor and strength.
3,"Bought this on the recommendation of my son.  Not a big fan of flavored coffee, but a cup a day of this lightly flavored coconut coffee puts me in the islands.  How can you go wrong with Wolfgang Puck?"
1,This coffee says Dark Roast & Extra Bold and.... IT ISN'T! It's weak and barely beats out a cup of Folgers.
5,"This is my favorite coffee flavor and I have not had it in a long time.  Forgot how delicious it was until we ordered the k-cups.  Love them, already ordered more."
5,I bought this coffee for my Keurig coffee maker and I really like it. Smooth  and the best thing it is an organic. Wolfgang uses the the best beans for his coffee's. Buy you will be pleasantly surprised.
5,"great tasting coffee. strong, but not obnoxiously strong and no nasty aftertaste. too bad, it cannot be purchased on subscribe and save anymore."
5,This is the best all around 1st cup in the morning coffee ever!  I love it.  Perfect flavor.
5,By far the tastiest coffee I have purchased from Amazon.  Sorry it isn't in the Shop and Save any longer.  Delicious!!!
5,"Love this blend, so was delighted to find it on your ""Subscribe & Save"" program (at a better price<br />than w/Keurig.  So REALLY disappointed to learn today it was no longer available on said program.<br />Shame on manufacturerer!"
5,"I have tried about 25 different K-Cup flavors, and this is my favorite.  It has a wonderful aroma, and just the right amount of Hazelnut.  Use the subscribe option, and this is a deal that can't be beat."
5,I buy these with subscribe and save.  I like the flavor and aroma.  Going on month two and I am not tired of them yet!
4,One of the weaker flavored coffees but a yummy one.  Almost no need for milk as it is already creamy tasting.
5,"This coffee is awesome.  Kinda bold, with a sweetness.  Excellent my son says with International's Carmel Macchiado creamer you can find in the dairy section."
5,The coffee was great. Spent some time in Jamaica and got to love the coffee. Nice to get in back home as well.
5,I like full-bodied coffee and to try something different to supplement the standard one I use.  This coffee was perfect for that purpose. Timothy's Rainforest Expresso is still my standard one...but I will order this again.
5,"Creme Caramel is by far my newest favorite!  Great coffee flavor, not too weak, with a wonderful caramel aroma!"
5,"I drink alot of coffee and love hazelnut coffee, this brand has the best flavor I have ever tasted. I have bought several different brands and this one is the BEST! It may be a few dollars more but it is worth it. I absolutely love and enjoy it every morning."
2,"I REALLY like the taste of this coffee! My only complaint is that the coffee grinds end up in my coffee. Not a huge fan of that and even though I really like the taste of it I will not order again, bummer!! =("
5,"My favorite, I have it auto shipped through Amazon. The only problem I have is I drink way too much coffee now because I like it so much."
5,This is one of my favorite K-cups.  It's a rich dark coffee without the bitterness of some.  Highly recommended.
3,I thought the coffee tasted fine.  It was not strong enough for my husband.  Several of the pods burst during brewing.  I probably won't purchase this again.
5,This is my favorite of the flavored coffees. I am not usually a fan of coconut but this coffee is deliciously coconutty-chocolaty! Love it!
5,"Yummy, mild, and delicious. My new favorite! Mild in comparision to coffees called ""rocket fuel"" and taste like motor oil, but truly a medium roast. Pleasant in the morning. Makes you glad to have a good cup of coffee."
5,Wolfgang Puck coffees are great and the Creme Caramel is one of my favorites. I would recommend this coffee for people who like a mild flavor.
4,I thought that because of the name attached that I would be wow-ed...its just a good average coffee nothing spectacular.
5,"I prefer mild to medium coffee and I've tried so many different k-cups but I'll stay with this one the other reviews were right on , smooth and not any bitterness. Just a great cup of joe. With amazon prime it came super fast, if you're not a prime member I strongly recommend it."
1,"This is a good French roast coffee, although it could be a little bolder. I've never before had a k cup dump the contents into my cup. It's extremely irritating to deal with grounds in the cup and machine when deliberately choosing a system that avoids the mess."
4,"I am impressed with Mr Puck's different blends, this one is a favorite of ours. It lives up to the ""medium roast"" name, full bodied, not acidic and smells great while brewing, will buy again."
5,Great Deal - GREAT turnaround!  What a difference from other orders I have placed with other vendors!  Got the package the day after I ordered it!
5,"If you like vanilla flavored coffee, this is it!! I put a french vanilla creamer in and no other sweetner is needed. I have it every day and I'll always order ahead so I don't run out."
5,"This coffee is Bold and none of the bitterness that is usually found in bold coffee's.  It also scored exeptional in the single serve coffee ratings and I concur.  There is a lot of dreck out there in K-Cups, this and Wolfgang Puck's Hawaiian Hazelnut are great!"
2,"I got this is a low cost alternative to my normal Jet Fuel and it just didn't measure up. I like strong coffee but this had a bitter taste that I just didn't care for. Also, 3 of the cups had some sort of malfunction and dumped their grinds into my cup-not sure why."
5,Very smooth and flavorful for a medium roast.  I was pleasantly surprised by this k cup and would get it again. The 25% off deal drew me to it and I'm glad.
5,"This is my favorite of all the coffees I've tried. Smooth and flavorful without being a flavored coffee, its a definite treat anytime of day."
3,"I was expecting a mellow caramel flavor, but this coffee is a bit sharp and you really can't make out any carmel flavor."
4,"This product takes getting used to.  Only after using about 3 K-cups did I start liking it.  However, I wouldn't buy this many again."
5,I'm loving this coffee!! It's smooth and bold but not too bold. It reminds me of starbucks coffee but not as bitter. Very very very good cup of coffee. Give it a try. I'm really glad I did.
2,I love Wolfgang Puck products but the coffee is very disappointing.<br />There is a weak flavor - almost tastes diluted!<br />Some troll must have changed out all the real Puck products!<br />Libbie
1,This is the 1st K-cup coffee that I am getting grounds in my coffee. It is occuring about every 3 cups. I have not had this problem with other K cup manufactures. I will not reorder.
5,"Until I tried Vienna Coffee House, Donut Shop was the one I had on automatic monthly delivery.  Vienna Coffee House is a tad bolder than Donut Shop but very smooth without any bitterness.  From the first cup, I knew I had to switch."
5,I love coffee with no bitterness and lots of good coffee taste and this one fits the bill. Holds up well to milk & sugar-I love it in the morning for the first cup and in the evening just as much. Definitely would buy it again.
1,I bought a 24 pack of this an drank almost all of them before realizing what the flavor reminded me of. It tastes like hotdog water.
5,I like my coffe of the milder but tasteful side.  I thought this was a great cup of coffe I compare it to Timothy's dounut shoppe.  Full flavor but not acid.  This is for people who want a lighter cup of coffee
5,Jamican Me Crazy is the best coffee.  It is not too strong and has a unique taste.  No complaints here.  Highly recommend it.
5,This not only tastes great but has the best aroma while brewing. Subscribe and save is the way to go.
4,trying out different pods and this is a delicious one. service was excellent. no hassle at all. will buy from again
5,"I like this coffee, its nice to drink it in the morning. It has medium body and full flavour. Goes great with raw sugar and splash of non fat milk."
5,"I'm a sucker for caramel anything.........love the flavor, the aroma, and most important the taste.  I honestly do not like flavored coffees in the morning, but I have made an exception for this one!"
2,"I thought it had a bitter orange flavor, however my husband and friend liked it."
5,I like a dark rich coffee and this is a tad different.  It seems much smoother and<br />I tend to nearly crave it when I have a slightly acid stomach.  It sounds odd and<br />I know I drink too much coffee but this fills that acid tummy niche.
3,"My husband likes strong coffee.  I like medium.  Neither one of us like this particular one.  There just isn't much flavor of any kind...coffee or caramel.  We like the vanilla one much better.  We'll drink this until it's gone...but it's the last flavor we choose, and it's lasting way too long!"
3,"The taste is fine, but the K-cup container has opened at the seal during the brewing process on more than one occasion, resulting in a mouthful of coffee grounds!  I have never had this happen with any other brand of K-cup before and hope it is not the norm for Wolfgang Puck."
3,"I prefer the ""extra bold"" coffees, so this one really lacking on the flavor.  It's fairly weak, at the smallest cup setting its drinkable, but I won't be buying it again.  I'd recommend the Timothy's World Coffee, Rainforest Decaf Espresso instead."
5,Wolfgang's Reserve Columbian Decaf is probably the best decaf we have had in a K-cup. Very good cup of coffee!
4,This is a coffee that I look forward to drinking as soon as I wake up! Very nice......
5,"Light vanilla favor....not overpowering. Nice coffee, the first box that was purchased was too light on the vanilla flavor and aroma....surprisingly the 2nd box was much better.  One of my new favorites."
5,"We love our Keurig coffeemaker and have tried many coffees.  Recently discovered Wolfgang Puck's new line of coffees and are pleased with all of his we have tried.  This one is smooth with a great flavor, no bite.  We would purchase this again."
5,"This is a mild but delicious coffe....some might say ""a dessert coffee"". I really liked it as a pleasant change from full bodied flavors."
5,"Was looking for a strong K-Cup that could hold up for the perfect Espresso and for a great cup of coffee! Now receiving on auto ship, if you're looking for a great bold K-Cup, this is it."
5,"I read several great reviews on this coffee on another site and decided to give it a try. It's now one of my favorites and I will be ordering it again. The taste is great, sweet but bold enough that I can do a large size and it still have flavor."
5,Great coffee.  Has a nice bold taste for a medium roast coffee. This is my new favorite. Give it a whirl.
3,Taste is okay.  Not blown away.  Hidden is the fact that this is truly a decaffeinated coffee.  Only place to find this out is on the bottom of the box.  Not what I want first thing in the morning.
1,I use to purchase Jamaica beans locally and it was great. This Jamaica me crazy is nothing close to it. The odor is terrible and it tastes like the coffee is flat or stale. Other people in household tried it and couldn't get past the first cup. Pitched the remainder cups in the trash.
1,"this was terrible coffee Wolfgang Pucks Jamaicamecrazy, I received a partial refund but felt I should have gotten a full refund as I can't drink the coffee and had to throw it all away. Also had to pay shipping and should not of had to. I would like a response to this."
3,"We love Hazelnut coffee, but this just didn't have enough coffee flavor in it for me. Kind of on the weak side in my opinion. I'll keep looking."
5,"Love this coffee! The aroma is as delicious as the flavor. My husband would typically have a cup of coffee once or twice a month, now he's having a cup several times a week."
2,"I admit, I am not terribly fond of flavored coffees. But, this one is not for us. We both love the Rodeo Drive. I have a good freind that loves this coffee. I sent her ours."
1,"I am definitely not a coffee connoisseur, but this stuff is bad.  It is a disappointment because I expected a Wolfgang Puck product to have more ""class.""  This tastes artificial and it can't stand alone without tons of cream and sweetener.  Will not buy again!"
1,The coffee tasted bitter and like it was burnt.  I cleaned the machine and it still tasted bitter and burnt.  Will not order this again.
1,"I'm amazed that people are happy with this product.  I'm not a drinker of the dark brews, French roast or anything, but even for a drinker of a milder cup of coffee, this is completely tasteless.  The initial scent is delicious, too bad none of it shows up in the actual coffee."
2,I got this through a Decaf Keurig assortment pack (also from amazon) and while I have enjoyed all of the flavors - thisone was so weak - I had to post a review.
1,This Wolfgang Puck Coffee Jamaica Me Crazy is the worst coffee I've ever had!<br />I threw it out right away after one sip! It taste like all coconut flavoring.<br />Hard to believe someone thought this taste good and was marketable. They should be fired!
1,Ugh... no where on the Amazon page for this item did it state that it was Hazelnut flavored.  I have been choking this down for a month just trying to get through it.  Thought it was going to be a Blue Mountain-like Jamaican coffee...
4,"It is a medium roast pleasant coffee, comparable to green mountain's breakfast blend. I bought it with a very good deal though."
1,This stuff tasted like pipe tobacco smells. My Son didn't like it either and I ended up throwing it out.
5,"Simply Awesome. I love bold coffee and love French Roast Brews. This is a truly wonderful FR blend. Dittos for Deidrich FR, both are awesome.<br /><br />I also tend to like the BOLD COFFEE PEOPLE KCUPS...Most all I've tried have been bold and flavorful, each with it's own distinct flavor."
4,"Highly recommended for those who appreciate a good dark roast coffee, Wolfgang's Sumatra Kopi Raya excites the flavor buds and ignites one's morning... always a good start to any day."
2,No thanks.  Kind of bitter and has slight overtone of cardboard.  Organic Bold and Donut Shop are still our faves.
1,The worst!!! it is just plan awful bitter and strong and you cannot taste the Hazel Nut flavor at all!!!!!  Do not buy this product save your money!!!!!
1,I thought this coffee was really horrible. Had one cup and will throw the rest away because it can't be returned.
4,Definitely not extra bold...medium roast at best.  Not particularly memorable...doesn't have a good coffee aroma...but it's pretty decent tasting.  At this point I'm not sure if I would reorder.
1,this coffee has a very funny taste to it not good you would think wolfgang it would be good dont buy this coffee this is a review of 6 people there are 6 people in my shop we all hate it not good
2,"Wolfgang Puck's ""Breakfast in Bed"" is a much more flavorful and robust medium roast than this one."
4,"This coffee has a very tropical taste to it, so it's perfect for iced coffee on a hot day.  The flavor is not bad when heated, but it just seems a little odd.<br /><br />You don't usually think of tropical beverages being hot."
5,I am not a fan of any of the decaf k cups I have tried but this one is probably the best.I like strong coffee and his comes pretty close to what I would expect although it says medium roast.
5,"I just got my box today and brewed a cup after work. It's one of my favorite k-cups yet!! I recommend it. Smooth, doesn't taste watered down, and no bitter aftertaste. The cups also look pretty in my k-cup rack :-)"
5,"Wolfgang Puck's Hawaiian Hazelnut is the best K-Cup Hazelnut and I have tried them all. We ordered this large pack, because we sadly found out that Wolfgang Puck is discontinuing many (not all) of their K-Cups, including this flavor. Buy this while you can!"
5,"So far, of all the decaf Kcups we have tried, this is our favorite.  Wish it were on the automatic ordering system.  Coffee is such an individual like or dislike but when we use it with an 8oz cup of water it is great."
5,I bought the Kuerig because I love the Dunkin Original and Green Mountain Nantucket Blend.  Rodeo Drive has now become my favorite.  It is very delicious and smooth.
5,"When I feel that I do not need more caffine, I have found that the Wolfgang Puck Decaf is a great substitute.  I really can't tell the difference, taste wise.  I had been having trouble finding a good decaf.  I think this one is it."
5,"I got a 5 k-cup sample box of this coffee from Keureg, and I find that it is my favorite decaf coffee. It brews a smooth tasting cup of coffee every time. I add some 1/2 & 1/2 and a bit of Equal, and it is a treat any time.<br />Glad to have found this coffee."
5,"Wolfgang Puck coffees are very good. This particular flavor of decaf is delicious - doesn't taste like decaf at all, very rich & flavorful. Also, this was a very good value for the price. I've recommended this product to several friends."
4,"I am usually a non flavored coffee drinker, but I do like to mix things up every now and again. This is a lightly coconut flavored coffee. The coffee itself is a medium brew and it goes well with the tropical undertones of the coconut. It is a nice summer drink."
5,I love quite a few coffees but this one is grabbing my whole households attention. It's not bitter but it's not light either. It's perfect. I love it.
4,"I switched to Decaf and was looking for a decent cup on the Keurig machine.  I was only interested in Subscribe and Save options.<br /><br />This is a fairly light roast, which I like.  I brew on the middle setting and I think if it was brewed any larger I would think it was too light."
5,Absolutely love Wolfgang Puck Rodeo Drive K Cups.  It is the best.  Nice rich flavor but not too strong.  Best one yet!
5,I have purchase this coffee several times my husband said it has a great taste and it is a good cup of coffee
5,"I think this is a love it or hate it kind of coffee.  I love it.  The flavor starts out similar to butter toffee, but then sort of morphs into coconut, pineapple, and rum.  I think it's delicious and unique, and I don't ever want to be without some in my cupboard."
5,"We've tried many of the K-cups that are available, and this is in our top 3. We prefer a darker, bolder flavor, and this one hits the mark. At the same time it's quite smooth."
5,"This k-cup is one of my favorites along with Coffee People's Jet Fuel and Black Tiger.  If you like a strong, rich coffee, this will fit the bill."
5,"Not too strong, not too weak...smooth without the bitterness.  Great anytime for those not into the strong ""grow hair on your chest"" types.  We will continue to purchase this as a part of our favorite brands."
5,Wolfgang's Rodeo Drive does make a good ole cup of coffee. It is on the same line as Donut Shop. Very good morning coffee to wake up with.
3,The coffee was more on the light side rather than medium roast.  I don't think I would purchase it again even though it was a good value purchase.
5,This coffee is for those who like a strong robust flavor. Nothing wimpy about it. I like just enough cocoa mix and creamer to take off the edge. My husband goes for the gusto. Great wake-me-up-in-the-morning brew. Love it!
5,"This is an excellent blend perfect for any time. Was really surprised by the quality, flavor and finish."
2,"As coffee, these kcups are just ok.  As ""flavored"" coffee these are disappointing.  I found the vanilla to be barely detectable."
5,"Nice, smooth cup of Joe. High recommend. Not sure why there is not more reviews?!?!"
4,"This coffee was in a ""sample"" selection when we ordered our Keurig Brewer.  It was by far our favorite!  I have ordered this coffee several times from Amazon.  It is a dark roast, but not too strong."
5,You get a consistent cup of coffee with a hint of hazelnut. A cup of hot coffee in about 20 seconds that tastes great... what's not to like about that?! :)
4,These have a stronger caramel flavor although still a medium strength coffee.  The best caramel flavored K-cup I've tried!  I will reorder them.
4,love this Rodeo Drive it has a very drinkable taste is also good and it is smooth! I recomend that you try this one.
5,This is the most delicious coffee ever It does not mess up your stomach it's amazing and tastes wonderful and everyone at work loves it too
3,I really like medium strength coffee but this is a little too bold to be considered medium. It is almost bitter when compared to other medium coffees.
5,Great product to start your AM with as its not too strong but just the right tast for your morning wake us up.
3,This coffee is okay but certainly not as good as Green Mountain's Breakfast Blend. It just doesn't taste as good.
3,"This is a great flavored coffee nevertheless, K-cups are getting too expensive for everyday home use.  I am now using the filler and using my own ground coffee much of the time. It's also helpful to look for other price alternatives."
5,"My Pomeranian loves these treats... he eats one every morning!  They do smell a little, but that is probably why he loves to eat them. I've ordered these many times and never had a problem with them being opened when they arrive."
5,"My girl has loved these for two years.  When the local retail outlet, Trader Joes, no longer carried them-we found the manufacturer.  This is one of the few treats Wilhi Girl enjoys."
1,"SORRY, AS I STATED ON MY OTHER REVIEWS MY GERMAN BREED, G.SHEPH. IS VERY PICKY...AND HE JUST DID NOT CARE FOR THE SMELL OF THESE BEEF ROLLS, HE DID NOT EVEN CARE TO COME CLOSE TO TAKE 2ND SNIFF....SORRY, NO STAR!!! BUT IT TRIGGERED ME TO GIVE IT AS LEAST 1 STAR TO CONTINUE MY REVIEW."
5,I purchased this cassoulet for my wife's birthday dinner. I never tried this brand of cassoulet before. It was delicious. The sausage was excellent. The duck was good. The general flavor was superb.
1,licorice  has  no  flavor very hard  to eat it was in a seal  bag  but  it  hard  not soft like other  licorice
2,"These pods are rather bland. I purchased them because I thought they would make a nice dessert coffee. They do not taste much different than regular coffee pods. I would not purchase them again, nor do I recommend them."
5,"I just love the French Vanilla Coffee!  It is gives my day a great start! Easy to use, one cup at a time, with no waste!"
5,"I love Senseo Paris!  It's easy, fast and great-tasting, with never that chemical aftertaste of so many of the French-vanilla coffees.  Amazon is the only place I can find it consistently...so I have it on the subscription plan!  Thanks Amazon and Senseo!"
1,"This batch was horrible.  Since most regular coffee were out of stock, I tried this one.  It tastes and smells awful.  Do not buy this flavor."
5,Senseo Paris French is one of my favorite senseo coffee's always a great cup of coffee. Great price from Amazon!
5,It's so easy to order our favorite coffee from Amazon.  We love the taste of the coffee and ease in brewing it.
5,We go through a lot of this flavor.  Love the Senseo machine and their customer service.  Love the ability to use different flavors of coffee and tea.  Everyone can have their favorite in seconds.  We just use a lot of the French Vanilla.
4,"Good taste, a little on the weak side especially since I mix it with half soy milk after it's brewed.  Delicious nonetheless."
5,Best coffee in the world.  I'm so glad I found it here because other stores had stopped carrying flavors-only regular.
1,"The particular packages had an off taste. However, the seller gave me a complete refund and didn't even make me send them back. I have ordered this item before and they were fine."
5,Great coffee.  We mix it with Godiva chocolate coffee or regular medium roast.  What a treat
2,"We have been purchasing this product for several months and have enjoyed it in the past, but this order is inferior.  Did the company change hands or outsource their production?"
4,"The Senseo pod coffee maker is my favorite appliance and Paris French Vanilla Caramel Bistro Coffee pods are simply the perfect blend of richness and flavor.  The taste isn't overwhelming or subtle, but just right.  This is the perfect way to start your day!"
5,"Senseo pods are getting harder to find, especially the Paris, vanilla/caramel flavor. I am happy to find these on Amazon at a very good price, especially at the subscription price."
5,So far this has been a great way to order my favorite coffee.  It has become really hard to find it at the local stores but Amazon had it even cheaper than I previously paid for it.  It arrived very quickly and I am waiting any day now for the next shipment.
1,"Hi, coffee doesn't smell or taste great. I recommend Senseo Vienna. Still have packages of ""Paris"" and nobody wanna drink it. Guess I just have to throw it away."
5,I have tried other brands of French Vanilla coffee and this is the best.  Highly recommend it.
5,Nice flavor and great aroma while brewing.  Everyone is always jealous when I brew it at work.
5,"How many ways can you say ""YUM!"" ?  It's a delicious way to wake up in the morning--or to enjoy any time of the day."
5,I love the coffee pods... And I love the fact that Amazon sells them in bulk.... Thanks...
5,This is honestly the best coffee and the best deal anywhere.  Check out the local store prices on this wonderful coffee and you will know why amazon and senseo are so great together!
5,This is really the way to go. Add some creamer to further enhance the flavor of this blend. I signed up for a subscription to have this delivered every month. I drink some every morning at work. Works great with the B&D Home Cafe system.
5,The coffee I ordered is great.  If you want a sweet coffee this is for you.
4,"The pods arrived fresh and quickly after ordering them.  By ordering the coffee through the subcription program they are a good value.  The flavor is good, slightly bitter after taste to this brand of coffee."
4,"Overall, this makes a great fast cup of coffee, especially if you are just going to add a flavored creamer or sweetener to it anyway.  I use two pods to make an 8oz cup of coffee and I am pleased overall with the strength."
1,They kept raising the price. The product was great and remained the same but they kept raising the price. This last order I have had enough and will be going back!
4,"This is a great coffee with excellent flavor.  You can add an extra pod for a darker, more robust coffee.  The aroma fills the air as your cup is being filled."
5,it is a good coffee flavor. I get it every 3 months. it is great to not have to think about getting the coffee. It just comes to the door.
5,As usual the coffee for the Senseo coffee maker is outstanding.  The French Vanilla has the flavor I prefer over the others.
5,Excellent tasting.  Will have to remember to order some more later.<br /><br />YUMMO !!!
5,I love this coffee and it is so convenient to have it shipped to me automatically!
4,"Good but Folgers version is significantly better tastewise and so far amazon doesn't carry it. Good price though, and I like the free shipping--which I'm not certain will last. Having a huge supply of these on hand makes it's hard to make coffee any other way though!! This is just sooo easy!"
4,"So long as you have a pod type coffee machine, the Senseo Pods, in all their variations, make a good cup of coffee easily. If you drink one or two cups of coffee per day they are worth the price of the machine and the pods."
5,"this stuff is terrific!  it's been at least 20 years since i have seen damson plum, jelly or jam, in stores in my area. the taste of AMISH MADE damson plum jam was just as i remember.  it has a smooth texture and is sweet without being too sweet. i will order this brand again."
2,This jam has little fruit taste. If you love damson jam this is not the one for you. It could have been any flavor. All you taste is sweetness.
5,If you have not tried this combination you really should totally awesome flavor mix great on roast pork or to just dip pretzels in or put it over cream cheese and use crackers<br />Would buy again great service and got here sooner than expected
5,"This is the second time I have ordered from them, and again, the service was wonderful!  I was impressed with how well everything was packaged, and also with how quickly I received my order.  I'll be ordering again from them!  Thank you!"
5,I'VE BEEN BUYING OLVATINE FOR 16 YRS FOR MY 7 CHILDREN TO DRINK. I BUY THE MALT FLAVOR AND NOW THEY DON'T SELL IN ANY OF MY GROCERY STORES THAT I SHOP AT IN CHICAGO. WHERE CAN I BUY IT
5,"We love Ovaltine! We buy all of the flavors! We cannot find Ovaltine in the Malt flavor, anywhere! Can you help us?"
5,"I couldn't find Rumford's at the grocery, just found brands with aluminum, but of course Amazon has it!  I have used this brand since I started cooking as a child at my parents' house."
5,"I learned to use Rumford from my Mother.  She could always taste the baking powder if another one was used.  Therefore, we never had Calumet in the house."
1,"After a few uses, this powder spoilt a cake. It has lost its raising power. It is still well within the expiry date and the container has been kept closed and in a dry place. Avoid this one. I plan to ask for a refund."
5,"Excellent customer service.  I sent them an inquiry via email and they responded quickly, via email and followed up with a phone call as well.  Item received faster than expected!  I love ordering from paella.com!"
1,"I opened the box to find a huge mess of chocolate all over the tray. Chocolate was no better than Hershey's and worst of all, it is imported from Hong Kong. I don't care to eat food made in China after all their countless product safety issues. Look elsewhere"
1,"This is the first review I have ever done, but I could not let this one go bye. This was the worst ever, save your money."
5,If you're new to this product you need to be very careful of dosage. It is strong. Some batches are stronger than others.
5,"Good flavor, unique in all the teas that I've tried.<br /><br />This tea is effective for cleansing one's system, but is not as harsh as a regular laxative.  It can be consumed daily or as needed"
5,I always have this in my house. I drink it as is or my favorite is mix with sprite. Oh So Good!! I have some every day. I do not mind the larger bottles as I use so much of it. Bring it on!
5,I love this green tea.  It is a good price for my use with my Tassimo machine.
5,My husband has acid reflex and this is the only hot drink that the doctor has recommend that he can drink.  Thank you Amazon for carrying this product.
4,"I really enjoyed this Green Tea, and I can't wait to try making it as a Green Tea Latte... I love my Tassimo machine :)"
5,"This is the quickest way to make a darn good cup of green tea!  I was skeptical about having a cup of tea that wasn't brewed, but this is very close!"
1,"I think I'm not a green tea drinker.  This is pretty awful tasting stuff.  Glad I bought just one bag, because I'm throwing it out."
5,"In my opinion the best soda cracker on the planet, if you like or love crackers Diamond Bakery makes the tastiest cracker"
1,This huge bag of chocolates contained old (white and cracked) chocolates that were completely melted all over the inside of the bag!  Noone at work would even touch them since they looked so sad and gross... what a waste and disappointment!  Will be wary to ever purchase from this seller again
5,My Mother-in-law simply loves these candies.  She is on her fourth tub since Christmas. She prefers them over the Sunkist Fruit Gems  I hope they remain a stocked item.
4,Soft and slightly chewy candy is optimal (not gummy) to me and these are that. The flavors are good but not great. They are heavily coated with sugar to sweeten them up as they are not sweet without the sugar coating. I will purchase them again.
2,"If you are looking for a sugar high, then these are what you are looking for. Too sweet for me and my family, I don't think we will be ordering these again."
5,More iron than turmeric but this is a very nutty tasty spice that I mix with all other spices. This is one of the main ingredients in most Indian Curry Powders. Bravo.
5,If you Love coconut water this kind is the must have.....I am on auto ship and it arrives on time and packaged to perfection to prevent damage.....
1,"Hi,<br />I am very disappointed with the past shipment I received of the ONE coconut water. 3 of the boxes were leaking and the coconut water was spoiled.<br /><br />Thanks.<br /><br />Laks"
5,Best coconut water I've tasted - and I've tried plenty of other brands! It's a must buy if you like coconut water!
5,This is the BEST coconut water!!!!!  Can't get enough  : )  It has such a smooth and pleasing taste! Vita Coco is another wonderful product!
5,"If you drink coconut water, this is the best commercial one.  No doubt.  Consistently good and if you decide to subscribe that is even a better deal!"
5,I get these for $4.34 at my local health food store - their price sucks!  It is one of the best tasting coconut waters around though!
5,This is a new package of O.N.E coconut water. The taste is completely different from previous packages.  It tastes like real coconut water from a coconut tree.
5,"Due to a failure in the packing of this item, it was returned before even getting here. I strongly recommend that the packing department does a better job, because i ordered it again and this time one of the boxes was damaged. Apart from all that, the product is great."
5,"These are good and low calorie. I keep them in my office for when i want a light lunch. I don't noticed that they are low sodium, but i don't eat a lot of sodium anyway, so it may taste different to someone else."
5,it is too bad that I can't find this product locally any longer.  It was a favorite in our household.  Now my source is Amazon and I'm just as happy with that as I was before.  It has a great flavor that is long lasting.
5,Arrived very speedy and the gum has an excellent flavor!! This is a gum chewer's gum.
4,I thought this fondant was very easy to work with and it tasted great! Also the wedding cake i used this product for turned out awesome and the bride and groom and their guest loved their cake!
4,"Amazing fondant from Fondarific.  So very convenient to get it through Amazon! Easy to use, nice taste and would definitely recommend it for anyone with a passion for cake decorating."
3,"This product worked well for small cakes.  It also tasted great.  For any cakes over 12 inches, it just would pull until their was a hole in it.  It is almost too soft a product."
5,This fondant taste great and is easy to work with.  Easy to roll out and takes very little kneading to make it pliable to work with.
5,"As always, Fondarific is awesome! Covers cakes wonderfully and it's so easy to use! Love it, and will continue to use it forever!"
5,"This is EXTREMELY better than Wilton!!!  Buy this and never use that nasty stuff again.  This is actually edible, unlike products and is very easy to work with."
5,I purchased this fondant for a wedding cake that I was making.  I have tried numerous brands and even made my own fondant.  This Fondarific fondant is easy to work with.  I am an amateur baker and will purchase this product again.
5,My order was on time and packaged correctly.  Bought this for my daughter who is a pastry chef and loves fondarific.  Price is great for a 5lb tub.
5,This was my first time using Fondarific and fondant in general. This one was really easy to use for a baby shower cake. It worked just as indicated. I also colored it and made a two tier cake (baby blue and white). the final product looked great not greasy.
1,"MY Fondarific Buttercream Wedding White Fondant, 5-Pounds IS as hard as concrete!!!!!!! I just received this today, I can't use it, obviously, I have a wedding on Saturday, what should I do? HELP! This a non return item, what should a customer do?"
5,This coffee is smooth.  The best coffee ever.  It is pricey so I will not be buying it that often.  But worth every penny.
1,"I was excited to see that Amazon is selling 100% Kopi Luwak. However, these beans were a huge disappointment because they had no aroma and flavor at all. I'm guessing that they sent stale beans because there was no roast date printed on the bag."
3,"I wanted to try this coffee once in my life. I was very happy with the company that mailed it, and the timely manner in which they sent it."
5,"I was thrilled to find a source for smoked paprika - this product is the ""REAL"" thing - wonderful, smokey flavor.  Also, speedy service.  I will be using this website for all my gourmet spices!"
5,Excellent product! good price  fast shipping . needs an insert in lid to seal container better!
1,There was no seal of any kind on jar. Cap had loosened slightly and some of the paprika had spilled out. Would not chance using an open jar so in the trash it went.
4,This gives a good flaver to Bar-B-Q even if done in the oven. It can be used to give a smokey flaver to food not done on a outside cooker.
5,I like the smoked sweet paprika better than other styles of sweet paprika. It came fresh at a reasonable price.
4,The paprika is good and the container will keep it fresh for some time. I use these bulk spices to make my own barbque rubs. The container is also recyclable for keeping the finished rubs.
5,"I've been trying to find a good paprika for a rub used in the smoker. This stuff is the absolute best that I've found. It's sweet but still has all the flavor you want from paprika without being overly smoky. If you make homemade rubs, I strongly recommend this stuff."
5,"I love, love this stuff.  i add it to meats for a great smokey taste.  i use it with herbs, other spices an brown sugar to make a super rub for bar-b-q"
5,"This is the smaller jar.  some what clumped, could benefit from anti-cakeing agents; however I wanted this for canning so it works well.  defiantly worth the price. contains ""chili pepper,garlic,coriander,cumin,clove(all smoked)"""
1,"I ordered  Smoke paprika, unfortunately i received regular sweet. I called and spoke with a gentleman, who promised to send me the smoke paprika and apologized for the mistake made. Until today (1 month maybe 2 later) still haven't received anything or heard from the company. Very disappointed."
3,"haven't used it yet , but if going by past Marshal Creek products ... ? should be good."
5,"I tried a small cup of sample at my local BJ's store and just loved it.Then I picked up 1 pack from the table right away, even forgot to check the price. Anyway, I will go back and see if the price is better at BJ's or at Amazon."
5,"I found just enough of this product to be totally addicted. Now I can't find it anywhere, how come?<br />It was the perfect blend to add to my morning hot cereal. Please bring it back.<br />I agree that it was good in part because of NO peanuts."
5,I used this in a gift basket for a ladies tea. I like the product myself. Very nicely packaged. Thank you.
1,I guess everyone's taste buds are different.  This product didn't work for me.  Every food item tasted as it should :-(
1,Dissolved an entire tab on my tongue and was disappointed to discover that it had no effect on ANY of the foods that I tried.
2,"After taking a tab, I was able to eat a hot pepper, but it didn't really taste sweet or good at all, just not very hot.  Then I tried some cayenne pepper, which remained hot with no alteration in taste.This is a nice idea, but didn't work for me."
1,"I dissolved an entire tab in my mouth and then ate bitter greens and it did nothing.  I added some vinegar to the greens and it did make it a tad sweeter, but it didnt make them taste good.....It makes really sour things slightly sweeter....but NO MIRACLE."
1,It didn't work for me.  Maybe its because I couldn't get past letting the whole tablet dissolve because to me the tablet tasted like vomit.
5,"GREAT for parties.  This stuff actually works.  I was eating War-Heads, which I normally hate, like they were gummy bears.  Eating a lemon tasted like drinking lemonade.  You've got to try this stuff."
4,Effects with some foods are more remarkable than others. I found balsamic vinegar tasting fairly like wine to be one of the most remarkable.
5,I got these tablets to try them out to see if they really worked and to my suprise they do and they made lemons taste amazing. Most of the other items on the list did not taste much better to me but I am still trying some out.
5,Make sure you salivate a lot and don't swallow for best results. They'll typically last a few hours. They're a big hit for guests. You can even get by with half after you've had one or two. Doesn't work too well on liquors but most sour and acidic foods there is a very noticeable effect.
5,"Chewed a few of these and ate cheese, hot sauce and a bunch of citrus. Pretty neat stuff. If it was less expensive I could see this benefiting those who'd like to cut down on their sugar but still enjoy fruits."
5,"this is a great product. i gave a few tablets away to family and friends and they all loved it. it made anything with citric acid sweet,and even made some fruits sweeter. its a real experience for the palet."
5,"First things first, these actually work. I tried tons of different foods and they all tasted a lot better. If you haven't tried these already, it's a must. It is definitely a great experience"
5,"Had fun with my family with the mberries, they absolutely worked for all 5 of us and it was a blast! Definitely worth a try!"
5,It really did help my father is a cancer patient and. Didnt want to eat because the taste was no good.well the miracle berry gave him a good taste again
4,Very interesting. The tablet itself doesnt taste that great but it melts pretty fast. The best stuff we found to try it with was apple and any citrus. It really sweetens the fruit. Its kinda crazy. It was fun.
5,The effect was just as described and worked for about 20-30 minutes. I'd recommend trying it if you're interested. You won't be disappointed.
5,Fun! Changes taste of so many things! Try it! We almost drank a whole bottle of lemon juice after using this fruit that's how well it works!
4,It works and lasts for a few minutes to make sours sweet.  Its trippy.
5,"For a real tast treat, you have to try these. Sour foods taste sugary sweet. Apples, strawberries and oranges will taste like the most delicious fruit you've ever had. This makes for a fun party activity where guests will marvel over the ""wonderful vinegar"" and ""candy-like limes""."
1,These tablets hardly work in comparison with the actual berries. If you want flavor tripping then buy a box of the Synsepalum dulcificum berries or grow your own plant instead of wasting money on the pill/tablets. In my opinion.
4,I tried two lemons after dissolving two tablets in my mouth.  It tasted just like lemonade.  One thing.  The package recommends 1 tablet.  That didn't work for me.  If you are a tad overweight two is better.
5,"I seen this product on Dr. Oz and I just had to try this out to see if it works. Yes, it works and I can eat and drink lemon juice three times a day.<br />It is a miracle pill. :)"
4,"I used the tablets and it made lime and lemon sweeter. It wasn't as sweet as all the other reviews claimed. The lemon tasted like a sort of ripe orange. I let my grandma try it, but she said it didn't work for her."
3,"They do make sour stuff sweet for a bit, but sometimes it gives it an odd flavor... great novelty item."
5,The mberry tablets worked great.  We tried a lot of the suggested pairings and most of them had some sort of fun taste after eating the tablets.
4,"It was crazy, it made things taste super sweet, some things not at all though. However, this deliverer was extremely reliable and i receiver my package a day EARLY. A first for me with Amazon!"
4,"It does work, but only for a short time.  You need to dissolve it on your tongue and then let the fun begin!"
4,"This stuff works, but be warned the effect doesn't last very long for some people but it is still amazing. My friend and I tried eating a lemon slice and it was AMAZING... until the effect started to wear off slightly in the middle of it."
5,"A very interesting and fun way to spend an evening. The tablet itself has a somewhat tart flavor, we sampled everything from cottage cheese to beers to fruits to salt and vinegar chips to warheads. Some differences were astounding, some not so much, great little adventure for your mouth."
5,"Just a tad expensive, but neater than heck!!  It really does what it says!  Awesome!!"
5,"They weren't mind-blowing, but they were definitely fun.  So far I've tried mine with a beer and a few snack foods.  Everything did taste noticeably sweet, especially the beer.  It ended up tasting like a cream soda.<br /><br />I'm looking forward to some more experimenting :)"
4,"These tablets are quite odd, but they do work. They have a sort of chalky taste as you let them melt on your tongue, but if you get past that the effect is amazing. We ate whole lemons and limes. Oranges tasted like candy. It lasts for quite awhile too. They are definately worth a try."
5,"It works. i took one, 2 minutes later i was trying different things in my mouth. Last thing im trying right now is beer and it taste different and sweat. if your into trying new things give these a try. i read that it wont work on some people but well chalk this as a did work for me review."
2,"Quite disappointed. The pills don't last that long (it wears off after a few tries per pill) and not all the food items on the suggested list works. E.g. Cheese. Maybe it was a bad batch, but I'm not taking the risk to purchase it again."
2,Worked very little. Sweetened fresh pineapple but changed the taste to a bit bitter.<br />A sour orange it did help. It didn't work on anything else at all.
5,"This stuff really works, makes lemons taste sweet.  Gave to a friend, she loved it and ordered 3 to give to her friends.  Great party idea, try mberry with all sorts of foods, will change their flavor, fun to experiment."
5,this is quite neat!  i could drink a glass of vinegar and it would taste just like syrup!  it is certainly worth trying.
5,Stephen's Hot Chocolate is the best hot chocolate in the world I won't drink any other hot chocolate. The French Vanilla Is my personal favorite.
5,"This has a very dark chocolate flavor that mixes quickly and smoothly in hot water. No chucks like most of the other brands. Milk chocolate is fine for those who enjoy that but for real chocolate lovers that enjoy the true flavor of dark chocolate, don't miss this."
5,This product is out of this world - if you like chocolate and you like peppermint - you will fall in love with this.  I had it years ago and never could find it again until this past Christmas time at Costco as a seasonal item.  So when I found this I stocked up.<br />I love it..........
5,This is my family's favorite hot cocoa brand. The kids favorite flavor if mint chocolate.
3,I was a little dissapointed. It tastes  good. It is just a little watery tasting. Land of the lakes is better. But they dont have sugar free. So for sugar free I can give a heads up on this product.
5,I purchased this for my girlfriend who loved this stuff over the Xmas period. Now she has a supply which should last several months.
5,If you haven't tried the Stephens Candycane cocoa you need to try it  but only if you like chocolate and mint flavors.  It's great tasting.  The only problem is that I want it year around and it is only available in stores at Christmas.
5,"I tried Stephen's Chocolate Mint truffle hot chocolate mix at a Church function and it was wonderful, I had to get some."
5,"I've tried them all and keep coming back to the Belgian chocolate.  A chocoholic's dream. I drink this every morning and this seem's to be the most economical way to buy it, 6 cans at a time."
5,My husband is a huge fan of hot cocoa.  I surprised him with a 6-pack of Stephen's Peanut Butter Cup Hot Cocoa.  It actually has little peanut butter cups in it.  They quickly melt into this delicious treat.  We highly recommend this product and will buy it again.
5,I was looking for something to replenish one of my favorite Black Forest(Cherry Chocolate)Hot Cocao mixes and this one works quite well and tastes even better. Keep up the good work.
5,I love Stephen's Gourmet Hot chocolate.  It arrived quickly and we have been enjoying it for at least a month now.
4,I just bought a six-pack of Stephen's Gourmet Hot Cocoa mix.  It's pretty good for the price.  My favorite will always be Ghirardelli -- but this does the trick in a pinch.
5,Has just enough of the raspberry taste without being over bearing. Will purchase more in the future when my supple depletes.  I had trouble finding a good raspberry hot cocoa but now I know where to get it.  This site will be one of my favorites.
5,"My wife absolutely adores this cocoa. Very easy to make, just hot water which for her is a plus.<br />She prefers this over Ghiradelli."
5,"This really is the BEST hot chocolate I have ever tried! And at this price, a terrific deal. It was delivered fast and as described. A+"
4,"I love hazelnut smell in my coffee so I figure it will also be great to have it in a cup of hot chocolate. Unfortunately this product doesn't give me a strong hazelnut feeling, just a little. Well it is still a good one."
5,"Enjoy the taste, milk free product. Ilike milk in hot cocoa, just can't see adding powdered milk. B U T, it is considerably less expensive at a local chain grocery store in my area. I prefer a mix of this and Ghiradelli ""Double Choclate""."
3,"This is an OK hot cocoa. I had been using Land O'Lakes product, but wanted to try this for a change. The taste is comparable, but the portions in each packet is smaller. I still like Land O'Lakes hot cocoa better."
5,"This is simply the best hot chocolate mix I have ever used.  The flavor is wonderful, whether you like hazelnut or not (the hazelnut flavor is subtle.) It tastes like you made it from scratch rather than a mix.  It's difficult to find, so locating it on Amazon was a great find."
5,"I ordered this about a year ago and have repeatedly ordered it since. Everyone I have shared it with has loved it so much they have also gotten right on Amazon and ordered it also. I mix it in my coffee, and when I am feeling particularly naughty, top it off with whipping cream. Delicious!!!!!"
5,Delicious taste---just like a chocolate covered cherry.  I especially like it added to coffee. Will give as gifts this year!
5,"This is by far the best hot chocolate I've ever tasted!  All the other flavors are good, especially the raspberry, but this one is my favorite.  I use just hot water, and it tastes rich and creamy!"
5,"I am on my second can, I ordered the case of 6 and I keep it hidden from the grandkids.  I never thought you could have good tasting dark hot chocolate.  I just heat a cup of water in the microwave for 80 seconds and add the chocolate.  It dissolves completely with stirring."
4,What can I say??? This is delicious on any day.  Sip til your heart's content.
5,I love hot chocolate but don't drink milk: this is THE BEST hot chocolate I've tasted using just plain water.
5,"This stuff has an absolutely incredible taste. Very smooth and you can mix it with water or milk. If you like vanilla and you haven't tasted this stuff you are missing out!<br /><br />Get it, it's worth it!"
5,"I love Stephens Chocolate Raspberry. It is the best I've ever had. Other brands I've tried were bitter and just not as tasty.<br />It stirs in smooth, no lumps.<br />My order arrived quickly, just as promised. I'm a very happy consumer of this product and the supplier."
4,"I tried this unknown manufacturer ""Stephen's"" and was pleasantly surprised. It had a good amaretto flavor along with the chocolate. The aroma is good. I use it in my coffee for a homemade mocha taste."
5,"Stephen's is absolutely the BEST hot chocolate I have ever tasted!  It is so creamy and delicious.  Every flavor I've ever tried is excellent.  My whole family loves it.  I don't know any stores in the area that sell it, so we are thrilled to be able to order it through Amazon."
4,I like the taste of chocolate and mint. It mixed well when I added Hot water. Next I might try a warm milk.
3,This product contains partially hydrogenated oils which is very detrimental to your health. I would rather pay more for a product which does not contain transfats.
1,The company does not operate properly I ordered the French Vanilla.  That is the selection I clicked on and I recieved the White Chocolate. They should contact a buyer BEFORE shipping a substitution.
5,"I LOVE THE HONEY LACQUAT, I HAVE BEEN USING IT FOR YEARS, AND I AM SHARING IT WITH OTHER'S"
2,"Price was misleading, once the high shipping rate was added, the tea was no longer the 'deal' it was promoted to be. Although once it finally arrived, it was half decent tea, but NOT worth the shipping and the wait, will go to my local tea house next time."
5,"An organic coffee for less than $6 a pound (with subscribe and save) with great taste, you can't beat that. This is my only coffee choice for now. I would rather have this than Starbuck's any day of the week."
1,I have orderred Jeremiah's Pick Coffee Organic Breakfast Blend Whole Bean Coffee more than 5 times however the last lot I received with really bad quality. Lots of broken coffee beans and very oily. Hope the seller can check what happen...I may not try it again.
5,"This coffee is phenomenal for the taste and value. I'm on subscribe and save and this is my daily brew, I typically go though 2 lbs a month or so. This coffee has an excellent flavor and is not bitter or spicy, beats Starbucks breakfast blend hands down."
3,I was really disappointed in this coffee.  It's a darker roast than i was expecting and the bag has no expiration date.  My coffee tasted quite stale and old.
5,This is the best tasting coffee at the most reasonable price for organic! Smooth taste.  Perfect for your morning brew.
5,"You get a fresh, bold, thick flavor from this coffee. Never bitter. I am addicted. I blend it with there decaf at night so that I can sleep. Great price."
5,This has become our new coffee of choice for the mornings.  It's a good price for a solid cup of organic coffee.  Beans are medium roast and very fragrant.
5,The organic breakfast blend has an appealing mild flavor. It is very reasonably priced for an organic coffee. I will definitely be buying more in the future!
5,"A great coffee, that is medium roast, not bitter. Yet it tastes as good as it smells. It is also well bagged to maintain optimum freshness.mmmmmmm"
4,"This is my second batch of coffee from Jeremiah's Pick. This is good coffee but not as good as their Foglifter. However, it you like a mild yet tasteful coffee, you will like this. I prefer a bit stronger brew though hence my preference for the Foglifter."
4,"I liked everything about the transaction, although I am sure that I ordered ground but I received whole bean. I especially liked the price and the speed of delivery."
5,"We love this cereal. I purchased this product and everything was great! The cereal was good until Jan. 2012, but of course my family has already eaten the cereal gone in like two weeks. We do eat these as a snack more than anything. I would recommend buying this cereal."
5,As usual this cereal tastes so good!  The boxes came quickly and timely.  I wish this deal didn't stop!
2,Love the cinnamon taste but way too sweet. I gave this to my Mother who loves sweets and she said she couldn't eat it either. Need to promote the cinnamin dlavor and cut the sugar
4,Easy to follow directions. The grass grew fast and strong. My dogs are eating it right now and I know it safe and healthy!
5,"I bought this for my Guinea Pig and he LOVES it.<br /><br />Its insanely easy to grow. It seems like it grows an inch by the second. 1 square will definitely last me for more than a few weeks.<br /><br />If you're looking to grow your own wheat grass, look no further, this stuff is awesome."
1,"First, the product pictured is not what you get.<br /><br />What you really get is are tiny packets called ""sticks"" suitable for flavoring bottled water. The box doesn't even say what size bottle it is sized for.<br /><br />I'm not keeping it so I can't tell you how it tastes."
5,"This is what I consider to be true ginger beer.  It tastes like very strong ginger ale.  It has a bite to it.  It is sweetend with refined sugar, not raw sugar, so it doesnt have that strange molases taste."
5,I bought a few boxes of these for gifts and opened one up because I couldn't resist.  They're so damn good I ate half the box already.  I'm buying a few more to hand out for christmas!
2,"I was very disappointed with the quality of the chocolate.<br />If you want the BEST, I've found that Ethel M.'s chocolate liquor barrels are incredibly good - but you WILL pay the price!"
5,These little chocolates were the party go ers for the season!!! They are very tastey unique item.
5,"Haven't tasted the chocolates yet but the shipping was very fast and they look as they were pictured.  we'll see at christmas if they taste good, too.  also, if you go directly to the company's website you can save a few bucks."
5,These are simply wonderful!  We found them fresh and very nicely packaged.  I would most definately purchase them again.
5,I sent this to my daughter and son as a gift for the holidays and New Years Eve. They loved these very much. Nice gift to be shared with many people.<br />The liquor filled chocolates arrived in perfect condition and were securely but attractively packaged.
4,I often order this product to give to others.  This is a GREAT gift!  Everyone to whom I have gioven this product as a present really enjoys it.  This is more special becuase anyone can give chocolate.  This is different and cannot be purchased at regular stores in many states.
1,"I meant to order Anthony Berg's chocolates and got this one by mistake...yikes, not a good outcome.  The chocolate is poor and the gel-like liquor is worse...don't make the mistake that i made..."
5,"I brought this for my co-workers for Valentine's day, they loved it, rave reviews.  I was really good and I would purchase and plan to purchase them again."
5,I bought this as a gift.  He liked it very much.<br />It came in good condition and good time.<br />I rate it AAAA++++
2,"You know how the chocolate turns light brown when it gets old? That's how these were at the top. They were that lighter shade of brown as if they were old. That part just didn't taste right, but the liquor inside was good. These candies weren't fresh."
5,"Sent this to my brother in Seattle and he loved them. Good flavors, great tasting chocolate, they were well received. Cheers!"
5,purchased them for as a special gift for a boat christening.  They REALLY enjoyed and appreciated receiving this unusual gift.  Received the item in good shape and quickly.  very pleased with everything. Will order from them again...
5,Gave this as a gift to my Dad and my boyfriends Dad for Christmas this year. They look great and i got to taste a few myself and i loved them they were so tasty and the alcohol was very real tasting. It was a good buy.
5,I sent this to my sister as a gift for the holidays and New Years Eve and the review from her was that she and all the guests at her house loved these before and after dinner liquor filled chocolates...... Nice gift to be shared with many people.
5,"Super Fast Shipping! I haven't tried the chocolates yet, but will at Christmas and leave another review then. But the chocolates came in excellent condition and just like pictured. I followed advise on another comment - to go to the company website and save a few bucks. Thank You!"
5,The liquor filled chocolates arrived in perfect condition and were securely but attractively packaged. i am unable to comment on the flavor as they were purchased for a gift. The secure packaging prevented me from sampling the various flavors.
3,"Delivery of the product was quick, however the items are smaller than how they appear on line. Next time I would order the larger size."
5,"I got these for my boyfriend for Christmas. They are a bit smaller then what i figured they would be from the box, I havent given them to him yet of course but i am sure we will have fun trying them. The box came two day earlier then what amazon said they would come which is nice :)"
5,"Fast shipping, items were packaged nicely and are as described. Also, very tasty :) Highly recommend this product to anyone looking to buy."
5,"This is my favorite form of stevia. It's highly concentrated, so one small bottle lasts a long time. I have a container near me all the time; at work and at home. It's also the best tasting Stevia that I've tried. And Sweetleaf is a good company. And the price is great!"
5,"I recieved my stevia a couple of weeks ago and it is excellent. My only problem is that the four containers were little more than half-way filled, but the total amount of stevia is sufficient and I've been using it everyday and I have not used much.<br />Overall, for the price, it is excellent."
5,"Only once before have I tasted a better chocolate covered coconut macaroon, and that was long ago and far away.  The dark chocolate is lucious and it's very addicting."
4,"They made a great impression on our family members. Great to celebrate the birth of our second Child. The chocolate was very tasty, and believe me... I know chocolate. =)"
5,Ale 8 is the best thing about Kentucky! It far exceeds any other Ginger Ale product on the market - both because of the delicious taste and because unlike most other Ginger Ale drinks it includes caffeine for that extra shot of energy.
4,"This is a good deal on whole vanilla beans, which I mostly use for making my own extract with Everclear.<br /><br />I stick them in the freezer to preserve, so it's worthwhile buying so many at once and getting the bulk deal on these."
4,"Purchased for making homemade vanilla ice cream.  Slightly smaller beans than expected, but overall flavor and price outweighs expensive local bought beans."
5,Nice alternative if you can't find them locally.  Great gift for the avid cook.
3,My cats all love this product just like they love the other flavors. I dare not run out of these treats or I might have a kitty uprising!
1,"Bottom line, this made my cat projectile vomit. I've never had a problem with him eating Friskies before but, I knew ""Cheezy Craze"" just didn't sound right. It came as a sample in one of the larger bags. Not fun to clean up after partial digestion."
5,"Top grade Tahitian vanilla beans, these are about three times bigger than the regular Tahitian beans.<br />Excellent quality, incredible aroma and flavor. Highly recommended."
5,"I don't know if chia seeds are really a ""super food,"" but this brand seems to be very good quality. I've bought other kinds, and these LOOK better. And since I only eat them sprinkled on my morning cereal, it's not that expensive to buy this higher-priced brand."
5,"I would buy Chia Seeds at Costco instead. It's 2 pounds for 7.99 and I use them in smoothies, over salads, and lately, I mix them in with Chocolate Almond Milk for amazing pudding in 3 hours chilled!"
5,"I've been consuming about 1 tablespoon twice per day, soaked for at least 15 minutes, followed by an equal amount of water. They help me feel more full throughout the day and thus I am able to consume less calories. The additional protein and fiber is an added bonus."
5,"These are much better quality than the cheaper seeds I bought on another site. Originally, I had them on a six month subscription (a pound twice a year) but I've changed it to monthly."
5,"I really enjoy adding these seeds to my smoothies.  They add a nice texture, just the right amount of crunch, and I think they taste like kiwi seeds.  I hear they are healthy too!"
5,"GREAT TASTING, WHOLESOME GOODNESS AT A FAIR PRICE!! I PUT THESE LITTLE SEEDS ON EVERYTHING! CHIA HAS A N EXCELLENT SHELF LIFE AND NAVITAS PACKAGES THEIR PRODUCT IN A RESEALABLE BAG TO ENSURE FRESHNESS!!"
5,"These tiny seeds really work!  Other than getting stuck in my teeth, they keep me full, offer additional fiber, and have little to no taste!  And I received my order super fast!  Great product and dealer!"
4,I really liked this product and am sad that I can't get it with Subscribe and Save anymore. Why not? (
5,Read one of the chia books out there. This really is a super food.<br /><br />The only down side is the price gouging here on Amazon. Chia can now be found in many grocery stores in the bulk bins for around $9.50/lb. $20/bag here is ridiculous.
5,"I add chia seeds to my morning shake for breakfast and I am in love with them. They taste great almost like tiny bobas but better. This particular bag last a long time considering I consume them daily.  They are also cheaper than most stores, def recommend this product."
5,"I'm all about the natural superfoods, so it's no surprise I got this.  Not only does it make you feel fuller for longer, it is also a natural thickener.  When my hummus looked a bit runny, I just added some chia to it and it thickened up really well."
5,I love adding chia seeds to my oatmeal or yogurt.  It makes the food more filling and doesn't affect flavor.
5,Love this stuff! I make my own granola and add it in. Will definitely buy again.
4,"I got this here last week, its yummy.<br />I soak some in juice overnight and put it in smoothies<br />or mix it with yogurt."
5,I love eating Chia Seeds and they are so filling I  put them in my oatmeal everyday. They help me with my digestive system!
5,People that research this product knows that is good to lower your cholesterol and is a great food for busy people that can have just juice for breakfast. The seller was extra nice and took care of me cause my package got lost in the mail and now I finally got it :)<br />Thanks guys!!!
5,Navitas Naturals Chia seed have become a favorite. It was easy to set up the next delivery date to enjoy these healthy seeds. I am sad Amazon has removed them from the auto-ship program. I will continue to buy them for as long as they are available for their health benefits.
4,"I like the taste and texture over all. I'd put it in my oatmeal every morning. as far as the energy it's supposed to give, I'm not sure yet. I also used it in stir-fry instead of sesame seeds. It's a great product overall."
3,"This simple yet tasteless product did what it said it would, thicken gravy and soups. This product in my opinion should be used in the morning before work or people who are studing late nights as Chia makes you energized."
5,"Came quickly and good value for the price. Product was fresh and of decent quality, I would  order this again."
5,"If you put two teaspoons of chia seeds in a bowl of vanilla almond milk and let it sit for a couple of hours, it makes the seeds more bearable to eat."
5,"The chia seeds are fresh, shiny and clean.  It is easy to use them and add to various recipes because you hardly see or taste them.  You just know they are there to make you healthier!"
5,"Muy buen producto, el cierre del empaque es fant&aacute;stico. Adem&aacute;s de todos los beneficios que tiene como antioxidante.<br />Lo recomiendo ampliamente.<br />Good product"
5,Okay so the doctor didn't 'order' these but I read about a lot of their benefits and love adding them to smoothies etc. The product came fresh and is definitely a good buy- will be ordering again!
5,"Title says it all, a Excellent quality product and Excellent service at a fair price. Product came ahead of time and as expected."
5,This is the first time I ordered these and they blend right into my smoothies! They seem a good quality and a decent price!
5,I add these Chia seeds to my Scottish oatmeal. Nutritious and yummy.<br /><br />Do I have more energy? Yes and I am attributing it to the Chia seeds.
4,I tried the chia seeds because I was told they are a great source of fiber and have all the omegas in them.I am very pleased with the product and they give me enery. Would highly recommend them to anyone.
5,"I highly recommend the hearty satisfying Chia seeds, for a snack or a meal, packed with protein and fiber - I often add it to waffles and other recipes!"
5,I add this to my morning steel cut oats and its awesome! A little in my smoothie is really good and I also put this in my Banana Bran muffin recipe too !
5,"We use these in smoothies, pancakes, waffles and even our vegan burger patties.  You don't notice them, but they add a great consistency and texture and it also helps as a binding agent in place of eggs."
5,"I'm very happy with this product. It was less expensive here than at my local Whole Foods and having purchased other Navitas items, I can say that it is quickly becoming a favorite brand."
5,I add a teaspoon to my protein powder for additional nutrition and because they have no flavor the chocolate taste is not affected plus Chia seeds thicken my concoction.
5,"I just love these seeds, got them second time and use them more often. They gel way faster and better than flax seeds and you can substitute these in many dishes (i am vegan and I am allergic to dairy products)... Love the quality of this product!"
5,"I really like them, I add them to my smoothies for lunch and it makes them more filling and I like the flavor!"
1,I bought this product not that many months ago and loved it BUT no longer buying this brand because it doubled in price! I bought it for $10 originally. Will buy another brand.
3,I bought these to put in smoothies and they do not totally grind up in the blender.  I am going to try to grind them by hand before i add to the blender. It all depends on your texture preference.  I do not mind seeds from fruits but these bugged me!
5,"These may last forever at 1T every day in my morning shake since I'm having trouble finding recipes for other ways to use these seeds, but they will keep (in a sealed plastic container)."
5,"If you love BBQ Oysters, this is the original west coast BBQ sauce! After 30 years, it's nice to be able to buy this outside of Pt Reyes."
5,"I bought the Wilton Cookies and Cream Brownie Crunch for decorating cake balls, and it was a hit.  I can't wait to try it on top of brownies.  YUM!"
5,"As far as I can tell, this is the only organic ""ready to feed"" formula on the US market (Earth's Best only comes in powder form).  It's about time!!!!  It's CHEAPER on Amazon than from the Similac online store."
5,"I switched from Similac Advanced to Organic when my daughter was 1 month old. She is almost 5 months now, no problems at all! She loves it!"
5,i love the fact that i can get this delieved to my house with no delievy charge.it is so hard to find organic formular
5,My daughter played this game at school and just loved it. She wanted to have it at home to be able to play with her friends and family. Its a really fun game until you have to eat one of the terrible tasting jellybeans !!!
5,"This was purchased as a game for my thirteen-year-old daughter's Harry Potter themed get-together to celebrate the release of the final movie.  The jelly bean game is loads of hysterical fun, and fit very well with our theme.  :)"
5,This product arrived very fast and perfectly new.  The kids had so much fun playing the game.  It is a birthday party they will never forget!
5,"I bought a few boxes of these as gifts for my Daughter and her family at Easter time. They were the hit of her household, when family and friends came by, they all enjoyed spinning and trying out the flavor beans they won. Awesome fun!!!"
4,Both dogs love these treats and they have healthy components.  The only reason I gave 4 instead of 5 stars is that these are made in China and that worries me.
5,I've tried several of the different FLAVORS of Folger's - this is the best - the old stand-by!  It makes a good cup of coffee every time.
5,"Folgers is good coffee, we order it regularly. Prefer the mild-medium flavors. Coffee is always fresh tasting, good to the last cup! Even after setting for a time it does not taste bitter. Get many cups of coffee from this size."
5,"I think Folgers is an excellent coffee choice. I have been drinking it ever since I have been drinking coffee, about 30 years. It is good at the beginning of the pot and just as good at the end of the pot."
5,I use this coffee with my toddy cold press system and it makes a very smooth cup of coffee. I so far have only used Folgers coffee with the system and see no reason to change as the end result is so very good.
5,I sent this to some friends who helped me out when I had surgery. It came and was beautiful. All of the items were really good and shipping was fast. VERY PLEASED!!!
5,This ediable image is easy for anyone to use. My man is into bass fishing so this was the perfect cake decor. He LOVED it!
5,"Excellent product. This is the first time my seven year old has had an ice cream cone in three years. When I brought them home, I thought she was going to jump out of her skin! After she had her cone, she asked for more and even upon receiving a ""no,"" she still had the biggest smile on her face."
5,We have two large dogs whose urine yellows our lawn.  We give them the recommended dosage with their dinner and it has significantly stopped the yellowing of the grass.  Good call.<br /><br />Bottom line- buy it.
5,"I have had persistently high cholesterol for years.  Allergic to statins, zetia made me sick--nothing pharma came up with worked for me (I am a workout fiend and half vegetarian).  My total cholesterol was always 220 or higher.  After one month of chia powder, it was at 187.  Nearly miraculous!"
2,"I ordered and got seeds.  Called, got a refund and reordered... got seeds.  I'll have to order the sprouted chia seed powder elsewhere. :)"
3,Gave it to my daughter who uses it in recipes but I wanted to use it in smoothies.  It tasted to bad to me.
2,"Ugh, this stuff may be good for me but it's not appealing.  I mixed it in my oatmeal for a while, and it was fine that way (but sticky).  But I didn't notice any obvious effect and I've slacked off."
5,"This is a good miso base. I make true miso soup, by adding nori seaweed, cutup scallions, tofu, etc. I almost didn't buy it, based on the poor review on a similar product, but I'm glad I did. It's tasty!"
4,This is a very good value.  I use it to put in many Asian recipes instead of chicken or vegetable broth.  The result is a more authentic Asian taste to my recipes.
5,"I love this product, very convient serving packages and only needs some ginger and cayenne for healthful benefits. Miso & ginger helps with clogged arteries & good general tonic, Besides being a very yummy cup a soup."
5,We love Miso Cup soup!  We use it to flavor our ramen. It is much healthier and tastier than the usual salt and MSG! The price on Amazon is great too! Less than half the price we were paying in a local health food store.  Thanks Amazon!
2,I did not enjoy this soup; I will try a different brand next time.
5,"This coffee is smooth and is not bitter at all. It is wonderfully aromatic and a rich flavor. I personally bought the beans in Jamaica but it was only $12 for 12 ounces, I have seen such inflated prices on the internet for this product and truly it is not worth it."
5,"There is a reason they serve this coffee at the White House.  Its the smoothest, best coffee ever produced.  Low acid, smooth in the mouth, and it has the most intoxicating aroma.  Worth the price."
5,We heard about this coffee before leaving for Jamaica so we pick up some and have fell in love with it.  The best we have had yet smooth without that bitter after taste so many other coffee have.
3,"I bought this coffee in Jamaica ($15 for 1 lb bag).  While I liked and enjoyed it, I prefer several coffees from my local shops at about the same price.  I think that it may have been worth the $15/lb, but no more.  Certainly not at these prices."
1,"I recently ordered the 16 oz., 3 Pack.  When my FedEx order arrived on December 26, 2008 there were only two 16 oz. bags contained in my order.  I would like my missing 16 oz. bag to be sent to me or at least be refunded 1/3 of my $105 charged price."
1,I don't get all the hype over this coffee. Not much of a head on it. Doesn't taste that great. What's the big whoop?
5,"I love this stuff!  It tastes like ice cream, just not cold.  Seriously, if you haven't tried this, you have to!!"
5,Great chesse to make snacks with. Melts so easy and has a wonderful flavor. This is the ultimate in american comfort cheese.
5,"Our Wal-Mart use to sell these pork rinds, but they haven't for probably 5 years. I hunted all over the place for them, until I finally found them. My husband loves them, he works so hard, I figured I'd get him something he loves."
5,"I love both orignal and spicy flavored, great any time during day or night.  Fresh and warm a treat that is usually only available cold and with two flavor choices."
5,Very good if you want to be on a Paleolithic diet. Very tasty when warm. Cooks great.  A great fast snack.
5,eating my first bag as i type.  awesome.  some puffed up to be light and puffy; others didn't puff up as much and are much more crunchy.  Which i like!  might be the best pork rinds i've had (outside of central america street carts)
5,These are so much better than the pre-packaged ones.  Not too many calories.  I cook mine for 2 min and 20 seconds in a very small microwave.
4,"Tasty, spicy, and good. Became quite the conversation piece at work. No one have ever  heard of microwave pork rinds before. They tasted them and love them. Only draw back depending on type of microwave as to how they will cook."
5,"I absolutely love these. A friend had found them in a random store down in Oklahoma a long time ago, and I thought they were awesome. But as I don't live in Oklahoma, and can't find these anywhere in the MN area, Amazon having them is awesome. They're low carb and taste pretty great."
3,"We own a small neighborhood bar and the patrons enjoy having the novelty of fresh, hot pork rinds served to them with their beverages."
5,"These are the best pork rinds around, near and far.  They are warm and just melt in your mouth.  This is a dangerous addiction, you've been warned!  ;)"
5,"Awesome!!  I love 'em cracklin out of the microwave!!! This snack is also not nearly as bad for you as, chips or other snack!!"
5,"Why am I just learning about these?  They are delicious.<br /><br />Enough in each individual bag for 2 people to share.<br /><br />Low cal, low fat, but not low flavor.  Highly recommend.<br /><br />Will be back for more."
5,"I love these bacon curls or pork rinds as some call them. I was so happy to find them again. Easy, delicious and high protein snack --- I eat them every night watchng tv. Never had a bag that didn't perform well........LOVE THEM!!!!!"
5,My husband loves pork rinds...a little too much!!  The perfect fathers day gift was a case of Lowerys pork rinds!
5,"Outstanding snack, super fast and lives up to the review I saw on the food network.  Just make sure you shake the pkg really good before microwaving.  All in all SUPER!"
5,"Can't find this product anywhere except on-line. I guess no-one enjoys them as we do. Same kind of hicks that don't like boiled peanuts I guess. Anyway, product is wonderful and was shipped promptly. Hope to continue buying from this seller."
5,"Really easy to prepare and very yummy. With my microwave I put them in for 1:40 and they turn out perfect. Warm, crunchy and tasty. And without the carbs, they don't impact your blood sugar which is a real boon for us diabetics."
5,"I saw these in a bar in wyoming somewhere.  My buddy loves the hotnspicy pork rinds and when I saw these microwavable ones I had them sent as a joke, however he said they were great and tasted just like the ones in a bag.  Nice"
5,"My husband loves these so much he never wants to run out. I've always thought pork rinds are disgusting, but when he 'pops' a bag in the microwave the smell and the sizzling and the warmth and the crunch ... I have to admit they are really good!"
5,"Lowrey's Bacon Curls Microwave Pork Rinds, Hot & Spicy,are the best thing since microwave pop corn. especially for diabetics(0 carbs)pop one in the microwave and vanquish that craving for a crunchy snack."
4,"These r great, only problem is easy to burn. Needs close attention while cooking. Follow the directions!! I only needed to cook these for one minute in my microwave."
5,"I was sceptical at first but after I tried the first bag, I was hooked.  Very easy to prepare.  I microwave these for a minute and a half and they come out perfect.  Nice and salty.  Fresher than the ones you get in bags at the store.  The hardest part is waiting for them to cool."
5,"The microwave Pork Rinds are a new product to me, but they are awesome!! buying a carton of them<br /><br />was a good deal and they have far less fat and carbs than chips"
5,Love the taste! Has a good flavor and very crunchy! Different then your normal pork rinds! Yummy!<br /> I would  definately buy again! Great buy also!
5,"Wonderful! Two mins in the microwave and I have a crispy, hot snack to have with salsa and Gucamole. Great for low carbers or those who want to avoid chips. Less than 4 carbs for the entire bag. The non flavored ones are also very good, but I like the spicy kick to these."
1,A terrible product we follow the intructions and did not get the the pork rinds.  We only got pieces of pork skin
5,I finally tried these noodles and cooked them in chicken broth and added to my stir fry.  Everyone liked them and commented that it was like eating ramen noodles.  Once I got past the fishy smell rinsing them I was happy with the result.
5,"I discovered you can use ketchup or any other condiment - bbq sauce, mayo, mustard, etc. for a great alternative to french fries."
5,"The convience of micorwave popcorn, 1 carb and lightly salty, well seasoned goodness.  If you never have eaten fresh pork skins, these are a must."
5,"these are so addicting that i have suscribed to them.  cannot get these at the grocery stores around here.  it's a hit for movies, parties, or just even a snack.  give it a try!"
3,I did not find the smell to be anything but inviting.  Warm pork rinds is a concept that was new to me.  I found the taste to be very good.  I had no problems with the cook time and the bag did not collapse on the product.  My only complaint is that there was just too much salt.
5,I like spicy snacks and this product fills the bill nicely. I will not buy another bag from the store after tasting these. A minute twenty seconds in the microwave and they are done. When my stash gets low I'll be buying more.
5,This is a great alternative to microwave popcorn. This is a quick and easy snack. It's got a great spicy flavor.
3,"Takes at least three minutes in my Micro, and some are singed while some are still old maids. Good flavor but just a little salty for me. I do not recommend."
1,"Too salty. But that was not even the worst of the problems. It has a weird texture (I cooked it perfectly) and tastes horrible. If you haven't eaten pork rinds before, please stay away. Even the worst popcorn tastes better."
5,"Lowrey's Bacon Curls Microwave Pork Rinds, Hot & Spicy, 1.75-Ounce Packages (Pack of 18).<br />Pork Rinds are great with beer. Love it!"
4,"Calling these ""Bacon Curls"" is a bit of a stretch, but they are in fact tasty pork rinds. I am fairly certain only bacon can be bacon."
5,For anyone who likes pork rinds and a decent spicy flavor these are the way to go!<br />Super easy to cook in the microwave and less cost than buying regular ones.<br />Great taste! Easy and not bad on carbs and fat as well!
5,"i own a bar and this product, along with the regular rinds, is a very good seller. keeps customer at the bar for snacks plus puts something in their stomach for the liquor."
4,"I got these for my low carb diet. I plan to eat them with tuna salad and/or guacamole. I cooked some last night just to see how it works. They were pretty good plain, but I'm looking forward to trying them with dip."
5,"These are great.  Just like pork rinds out of the bag, but fresh and hot whenever you want them.  Beware they really are hot and spicy but I love the heat.  Make sure to read and follow the directions before microwaving!"
5,"Amazon,we'll be back!  My daughter and I just started a very low carb diet and were searching for a snack.  The Lowrey's Micro Pork Rinds really fit the bill.  We both enjoy this snack and our diet loves it too!"
5,"I have a G.E. 1,000 watt microwave-i cooked 6 bags before i got it right-if you like them soft and light-puffy-not hard and crunchy-try 2 min 30 secs-no hard pebbles -just light , fluffy, and totally what you want-full power 2 1/2 minutes and you will thank me...."
4,"Great taste/flavor, medium spicy, crunchy, easy to prepare! Could be a little less expensive- approx cost is $1.00 per bag. Serving size is good."
5,I bought several brands of microwave pork rinds and Lowrey's is the best.<br />They're very quick to heat (pending microwave) and the rinds actually<br />take shape. Available in original and hot & spicy.  Good deal through<br />Amazon.com
5,"they are easy to prepare, great to eat and so much better hot also add hot sauce for added spice"
4,This product was very easy to prepare and was actually good tasting. Had the guys over for football party they loved them!!!!
4,way too much sodium.These are great for dieters 'cause they are low carb but the high salt content offsets that somewhat.They taste great and I'll still continue to buy them but cut back on how many times I eat them.
5,"I have not been able to find these in any grocery stores in Montana.  They are a great late afternoon snack with just the right amount of kick!  If you follow the directions on the package, they really do puff up nice!"
5,Very good flavor and easy to prepare.  Compact for storage. Friends said they really enjoyed them and wanted more. I can't find them in local food stores.
5,My husband has been looking for this product in the store and it is nowhere to be found. He is a happy camper.
4,"Yummy-they are still crackling when you take them from the bag!  Fresh and delicious, high in protein!  Be sure not to overcook them."
5,My husband & I discovered this item while shopping a while back and fell in love with them.  they are so fresh when you take them out of the microwave.  We like the spices on them.  You just have to remember to take them out of the microwave as soon as the bag rises.
4,"These pork rinds from Lowery are a quick snack, but very easy to over-cook. I like the spicy and wife likes the plain. Hard to find in stores, so I order from Amazon.com"
5,I have tried every kind of pork rinds on the market and Lowrey's microwave pork rinds are the best I've ever had.  I've given friends some to try and they totally agree with me.  The only problem is that they are hard to find.  That's why I ordered a case from Amazon.
5,"I used to get this product at Walmart but in there great wisdom they stopped carrying it. I love this product as it is light, easy on the diet."
2,was really dissappointed in product... too salty and poor flavor....Convenience is what makes product worth purchasing if you like pork rinds...
4,"So they lose a star because I think they smell like the devil, and taste similar. Not like pork rinds I enjoy. The seasoning salt they add is not my thing, I cant quite pin it down.<br /><br />But my wife enjoys them. So they get a good review."
5,My husband and I love these. They taste soo good fresh from the microwave. I was pleased to see these as a pack of 18. I can only find 3 packs at my local grocery store and they are not as economical.
5,"What an awesome snack, super easy to make and doesn't disappoint whatsoever. The flavor is totally there, they come out perfectly hot, crispy, light and stays fresh throughout the week..if you are in the mood for something salty, its the ideal snack!  Love these, they are addictive!"
5,I am so glad we can get these from Amazon! Our family loves these microwave pork rinds and we can no longer get them from local grocery stores. If you like pork rinds you love these fresh popped ones.
5,This is a snack that is great any time of the day!  Just enough to share with a friend!  It is an unusual snack that I cannot find anywhere else except amazon.com.<br />I am so happy that it is available!
5,How can pork be bad? Truly a technical food marvel. People are stunned and amazed at microwave pork rinds. Delicious!
5,These are really easy to cook in the microwave and are fresh and warm every time. They are part of my low carb diet and this is a great price.
5,"This is a delicious product. It starts out as little dry hard bits of pork rind, you microwave them for the few minutes it states and poof they turn into light tasty fresh pork rinds. really cool how it does it. love them!!"
5,"I normally eat one of these every other day, they are very delicious and better than any of the pork rinds you can buy at the gas stations.  The whole family loves them!"
5,"Microwave pork rinds. Hard to find at the store, made easy on Amazon. Fast and delivered to your front door at a better price."
5,I have recently had gastric bypass surgery and these are a good source of protein that are quick and easy to make.
5,"A great alternative to Carb full popcorn!  Warm and satisfying snack.  Salty and crispy.  Remember to watch carefully in the microwave, the bag does not pop up so its a little trial & error the first time or two.  You'll know when theyre done when you open the bag and everybody looks fluffy."
5,"These are hard to find in the store and my hubby totally loves them. Bought by the case you get them cheaper than else where. Great for those on low carb. diets. Crispy, crunchy, spicy and salty. I cannot complain about this quality product."
5,"This is an excellent product for curbing the appetite without the abundance of carbs.  They are crisp, fresh and great tasting.  Since I started eating these pork rinds, I dropped some unnecessary pounds."
5,"Hot, fresh, salty, delicately crisp, porky deliciousness in a minute and a half.  Can't beat that with a stick!"
1,"I received my shipment today, and tried to microwave four bags using different time settings. Only one or two out of each bag microwave correctly. I even put the unpopped on a plate as someone suggested and nothing. I carefully followed directions for each bag. If I could rate this, a zero I would."
5,"This product is the best! They cook up in about a minute and a half, nice and hot and crackling! Plenty of flavor to them! :o)"
5,"I saw this product demonstrated on The Food Channel and knew I had to order it as I LOVE pork rinds but the bagged ones are usually old and sort of stale or processed tasting.  Follow CAREFULLY the directions with these for a spicy, fresh and tasty snack every time. YUM!!"
5,I am a big fan of eating microwave popcorn.  A friend of mine suggested pork rines I thought she was crazy.  Little did I know that they are best microwave snack that I have ever eatin in a long time . Now i can chose between microwave popcorn and pork rinds.
5,"we bought these after seeing a show called unwrapped, we have never heard of microwavable pork rinds, we absalutely love them!! and order them regularly."
5,You have pork rinds auto shipped to your house - but I dont care - having these low carb snacks readily available is great - and doesnt impact my insulin usage. These are not your fathers pork rinds - awesome hot out of the sack
5,Found this item in the grocery store a few years back and then it seemed to just disappear...found it here and sooooooo happy that I did!  Everyone that tried it loves it too!  Good thing it comes in the big pack!!!!
5,"What a thrill to receive in their stockings - no kidding. I can't see it myself, but the rest of the family is utterly wild about these little things. Just like a mini-trip to the State Fair, warm and crackling from the microwave."
5,Bought these for my brother and he loves them.<br /><br />Hot out of the microwave and some beers.
2,"I tried these and wanted to like them, but just couldn't.  They did not seem to ""pop"" very well (a lot of wasted product in the bag) and they didn't taste very good.  I will not be buying these again."
5,"If you like pork rinds these are the best...... I buy these for the bar that I own and they are a favorite with the customers. So simple, pop them in the microwave for 2 minutes and you have fresh hot pork rinds. I have these on scheduled delivery so I will never run out, nice option. Great snack."
1,"Yuck, these do not taste good and they are quite tough. Better off buying the bags of rinds already prepaired."
5,These are wonderful and they are approvesd snacks for the weight loss program I am on.
5,These are very tasty - easy to fix.  A great snack for diabetics.  No carbs!
5,"Quick and easy snack.  Consistently tasty and good quality.  They do, however, require different cook times in different microwaves. Actually healthier than potato chips."
5,Great product and good price. Husband loves the taste and they are very flavorful when warm.
5,"These rinds are so good! If you eat one, you may want to keep on buying them! Great price for a cased product!"
5,"love it, i always try to tell my friends so they can buy them too"
5,These are the best I've had! The flavor is amazing and they crisp right up in no time. I've tried other brands before and they just don't cut it. I will be buying a lot more of these. I wish walmart still carried them.
1,too much MSG gives it a nasty salty after taste.  i basically gave them away.
5,We love these and will order again soon!  All of our friends that we shared with had to have a bag or two so are almost out.
5,"If you like pork rinds... You'll LOVE these!  I got them while doing ""thrive"" and they were so good. I've introduced them to several others and now there is about 7 of my co-workers that love them too! Try them you WILL love them!"
3,"I like the taste of these but they are inconsistent in texture (some are really really hard, while others are what you would expect).  You have to be careful with the microwaving part, but even when you are, it's hard to get consistent results. They also could be a little spicier for my taste."
5,"we used to buy these at an area store and then suddenly they didn't carry them anymore.  THIS is the way to eat pork rinds...just the right amount and way better than a bag from the grocery store.  and even with the shipping and handling, the price is better.  enjoy!"
5,Couldn't find these in the local stores anymore so I was glad to find them at Amazon  This is a great tasting low fat snack
5,"I found these Pork Rinds several years ago and just love them. I didn't believe at first that they would really pop in the microwave but they do, just like pop corn. They are so great because you get to eat them warm instead of just out of the bag ! !"
5,"Enjoy this treat on my low carb diet. Nice to have a ""chip"" to dip"
5,"These are great, but I find they need about 3.5 to 4 minutes to cook, and let stand 2 more minutes."
5,excellent product....bag expands like popcorn..chowed a bag during avatar the the other night and fell like i was at the movies
5,These are absolutely wonderful and they are shipped every month to my home so I don't even have to buy them from the store. I also get them for less than half the price I would pay at the store. I love shopping online.
1,OK but too Salty.  they should make a low sodium version.  The spicy is better.
5,These are no comparison to the packaged skins in the store.  One taste and you are hooked.
5,I first purchased this product a few months ago after a co-worker mentioned them.  So I decided to try them out for myself. To my surprise they are very delicious.  I'm sold! and will continue to buy them. If you like hot fresh pork rinds and spicy ones.  This product is for you. Sincerely Summer
5,I very much enjoy the microwave pork rinds. Scheduled deliveries make things simple and convenient.
5,"If you are a fan of cracklins"" you'll love these. Hot and fresh, the microwave does a remarkable job.  Not too salty and they have a true crackln taste."
1,"Could not get the bags to ""pop"" any edible pork rinds.  I tried several bags with no results.  I finally had to throw them out.  I was very dissapointed with this product."
5,We were very pleased with the product and have introduced family and friends to it and all have been very pleased and suprised so we will be continuing to order these. Great product.
1,"I hated the flavor of this product, I ended up just giving it away at work who ended up giving it away to there friends."
5,We love these pork rinds.  So easy to make and low fat too.  The seasoning has just enough heat to give a kick but not overwhelm you.  We used to buy them occasionally from a local store but haven't seen them in ages.  Thanks Amazon for carrying them.
4,"This is the best low carb snack next to popcorn, they are both microwavable.  I like it best with a sprinkle of lemon juice."
5,Everyone who tried the pork rinds loved them and were amazed that you could cook them in the microwave.
5,Wow. It's amazing how so simple a snack can be so tasty. I wanted something crunchy that wasn't a carb. You might want to eat only bland veggies the rest of the day because it is high in fat and sodium. But a great guilty pleasure nonetheless.
5,"We originally found these at Wally World.  When we could no longer get there, I hit the internet.  Both are quite good . . . we prefer the spicy."
1,"Lowrey's Bacon Curls Pork Rinds: 1.75 ounce microwave bags are loaded with 350 milligrams of salt, Thats all I tasted, A pinch of salt would have been better."
1,The bags catch fire in my microwave and that leaves most un-popped and extremely over-salted.  This product is inferior to other brands I have tried.
2,"Not one member of my family, including me, like these extremely salty, much too strong a BQ taste to order more.  I purchased them on a recuring basis and i wish to cancel now.  I have received only one shipment. Cancel further shipments.  Not to our taste at all. These are Lowery pork rinds."
1,"Horrible ""hemical"" taste.Extremely salty !!!!!!<br /><br />This was a complete waste of money,after the first bag I will have to throw the whole box away !!!!!!!!"
1,"I tried to ""cook"" 6 different bags of these.  Only a fraction of product ""popped up"".  The ones that managed to pop tasted overly salty and had an unusual flavor.  Unfortunately, they were not returnable, so the rest will be going to the trash.  Waste of $$$."
1,This is my first time and I can't eat them they are all small hard peaces with only a frw puffie ones. Is there something wrong with my batch? I can't eat them or they would break my teeth am I doing something wrong I only cook them 1 min.
5,This product is fantastic.  Instead of popcorn we eat pork rinds.  They have no carbs which have helped us to keep our weight down.  We feel we have made a better choice.  We eat them practically every night.  Thanks for a great product.
5,"These are wonderful, we found them on vacation.  I like the fact that you only use a small bag, no waste.<br /><br />Will be ordering again soon.<br /><br />Jeannie"
5,"For pork rind lovers these are the best.  Hot, spicy, low fat and crunchy."
5,3.5 Carbs and 210 calories in an entire bag.<br />Have a slightly different texture than regular rinds but still great.<br />If your watching sodium these may be a little high for you. over 1000mg sodium in the bag.
5,To anyone who likes pork rinds this is for you!!! but you got to have a strong microwave so they turn out lite and fluffy and they taste fantastic!!!!
1,These pork rinds contain MSG which is not stated on the listing.  Deceptive listing for this product.  Will not purchase again.  Shame on Amazon for wasting my money.
1,I was so excited when I heard about this product. I love pork rinds. But these have a nasty chemical smell and they really don't taste good at all. Don't waste your money. I actually threw the remaining 17 packages away. They REALLY SUCK!!!!
3,"These taste just like any other packaged pork rind product I've tried. I was hoping these would be fresher, closer to the real thing I buy in Mexican markets. Oh well, for a quick snack when you don't feel like leaving the house, it's fine."
1,"These pork rinds by Lowery's suck.<br /><br />I have tried to leave a review, but it appears that Amazon.com has their heads as far up their a**es as Lowery's.  I don't expect to see this posted."
1,This is a great idea but just like baking a cake...you can't do it in a midrowave.
1,"Lowrey's Bacon Curls Pork Rinds: 1.75 ounce microwave bags are loaded with 350 milligrams of salt, Thats all I tasted, A pinch would have been better, or no salt at all."
2,"In all fairness my friend absolutely loves this product.  I purchased it based upon his suggestion.  Unfortunately, the smell (oil I am assuming) of it cooking made me feel ill.  Even though the product cooked perfectly, the smell lingered in my microwave for well over a day."
1,"I recieved my bacon crisps. The price is OK, but I did not order hot & don't know how to change my subscription."
5,These are amazing for the low-carber.  I can't believe they're not available any more.
5,"These Lowrey's Bacon Curls are wonderful.  They are so fresh, great tasting.  Have found however that cooking them in the bag doesn't work very well, so we spread them out in a single layer and heat for 5:30 minutes in a 1000 watt microwave.  Will be ordering them again."
5,"Love these was unable to find them in local stores, so I ordered them. Thanks great low carb snack."
5,"These things are great! If you like pork rinds, try these out. Stick them in the microwave for 1:40 and enjoy."
5,These are as good or better than the Deep Fried ones you get at Theme Parks across the country!!!
5,Microwave pork rinds make a great and easy snack for diabetics. They are extremely low carb and hi protein and also low fat for those who are dieting.
5,"When you need a quick snack, try these.  In about 90 seconds it is ready. Hot and tasty.  Just what you need for watching a movie on TV.  You can make them and still catch most of the commerical."
4,"These are a wonderful snack, better than popcorn, and they are not so hard on the teeth like other pork rhinds."
5,"A delicious product, can't seem to find it in the stores these days. I recommend to try if you like pork rinds.<br />Quick Delivery and great to have for guests."
5,IF YOUR A PORK RIND LOVER THIS IS AN AWESOME PRODUCT FOR THOSE WONDERFUL TASTE BUDS. THEY MELT IN YOUR MOUTH BEFORE THEY GO DOWN. MMM MMM GOOD.
4,This is a great product. You do have to play around with the cooking time for your microwave or you can easily overcook. The product was delivered quickly and in great condition.
5,"It cooks in microwave so fast, and it's really good right after you cook, but unfortunately it has MSG in it. Nonetheless, the fat and sodium content on this is not too bad when compared to regular pork rinds. I uploaded a photo of the nutrition facts so you can see the ingredients too."
5,I can't find these in the local store so I order them.  They have much better flavor than the already prepared kind.  Microwave like popcorn.  Low carb.  Be sure to shake the package like it says.
5,I love these both kinds once you try them you won't be able to eat the prepackaged ones ever again. They are crispy spicy and fresh
5,I've been eating these (regular and spicy) for several years.  They are definitely superior to the non-microwave kind.  Shake the bag as directed to make sure they are not stacked on each other and I put them on the popcorn setting in my microwave.  Soooo good.
5,"We originally found these at Wally World.  When we could no longer get there, I hit the internet.  Both are quite good . . . we prefer the spicy."
5,I'm so glad these are finally available again.  My boyfriend loves these!!  I try to buy them every month for him.
4,"the next best thing to fresh!<br /><br />if youve never had fresh pork rinds, this is something youve got to try!"
5,These pork rinds are the bomb!  They're excellent coming out of the microwave.  Yum!
5,I like the texture to these pork rinds more than any others.  There's something special about have these hot and fresh cooked.  Try dipping them in nacho cheese with jalapeno slices.
5,my husband loves these! right now we are currently stationed overseas and it just brings back a little of home to him. amazon has been the only place that i can find that sell these.
5,The Ortega microwave port rinds pop up like popcorn and they taste fresh and has excellent flavor.  The shipment arrived in great shape and was shipped promptly.
4,"This is a very tasty snack although a little too salty, otherwise I love them."
4,"If you enjoy pork rinds like I do, you can't miss this product.  A minute and a half in the microwave, and you've got warm, crunchy deliciousness.  There's just the right amount of spice, too.  This is a great product."
5,NO CARBS  This is my favorite snack -  very light and crunchy.  Not as dry as the packaged pork rinds.  I love these -  Been getting these for 6 years and still order them every 2-3 months.
4,"I love these things, warm pork rinds that tast fresh and the size of the bag is just the right size"
4,"A friend of mine sent me some of theese, and I thought it sounded kinda gross. But found they were quite good for a snack, but the only place I've found them on the west coast is online"
5,"If you like pork rinds you're going to love these. They come out of the microwave so warm, light and crispy. Great snack if you're on low carbs."
5,"Lowrey's chicaronnes are probably the best pork rinds available in the USA, always fresh after proper time in the micro-wave."
4,I wouldn't have these every day but I found them to have plenty of flavour and kind of fun to cook.
5,"At first, I thought the product was a joke, but not so, delicious and fresh!!! Try them."
4,"I tried both the Original and the Hot and Spicy, both are marvelous.  Only problem I have is that both are a little on the Salty side.  2 Minutes in the Microwave and you have cracklin pork rinds.  I can no longer find any in my local super market, this is a wonderful substitution."
5,"i can no longer find these in our local stores.my whole family loves these.my kids love to hear them ""pop"".the taste is very good.we prefer these over popcorn.very happy to find these.I will buy more!!"
2,"Not thrilled with this one - threw most of it away.  For some reason, the result ended up being ""gummy"" which isn't something I expected from this type of product."
1,Someone at work cooked these and the smell is now making everyone sick. Smells kinda like puke. Hopefully the smell does not last overnight. Not recommended.
1,Terrible. Half of the rinds don't cook and the ones that do are gummy and shrink. Contacted Lowrey's about the defective product but they failed to respond.
3,"I had trouble finding just the right amount of time to microwave Lowrey's Bacon Curls Microwave Pork Rinds and now that I have they're okay, but I doubt I will buy them again...I ruined quite a few in the process."
2,I expected better. Flavor is o.k. But half of the rinds do not puff up no matter what the timing in the microwave.
5,MY wife is definitely not a chocohalic and is not fond of most sweets. In fact Werther's is the only candy she really likes. So instead of chocolates or flowers I bought this monster box of Werther's for Valentines day. It was a big hit.
5,Werthers is the best candy I ever tasted. I have become addicted to it. It is the only candy I eat!!!
5,"Yummy,<br />This is a candy I have enjoyed since I was a child. It reminds me of sitting on the front porch in the swing with my grandmother. When I pop one of these little pieces of heaven into my mouth it brings back great memories of the days gone by."
5,We appreciate the availability of this coffee from you.  I order and it arrives quickly. I'm getting ready to place another order now! My Dept loves it!
3,"This chili is filling and mildly spicy. Cooks well, however it makes exploding noises in my microwave."
3,"Keep box of saltines nearby and nuke this stuff and it's about the best lunch out of a microwave that I have ever had in my 45 years of working.<br />Nice and thick, no weird burnt spices, mystery meat, but they all have that.<br />I will buy this again."
3,"One of the disappointments with Campbell's Chunky Chili is that the ""meat"" is chewy and doesn't really taste like meat. Overall, the chili is acceptable as a quick lunch alternative but don't expect anything resembling homemade chili."
3,"Campbell's makes some great soups,but their chili on the other hand,leaves alot to be desired,it's tastes okay,just not up to snuff,I prefer Hormel(w/ or w/out beans) or even better HOMEADE!!!(and I make a mean chili,no compalints yet!!!)"
2,"I think this chunky chili is the worst store-bought chili.  The meat has the texture of artificial soybean meat and is chewy, the<br />sauce is too sweet and cloy.  This has no character.<br /><br />I prefer Hormel or Dennisons to this.  By far."
5,"I had never tried these before and wanted something different. These turned out to be really good, I even made some Chili cheese fries that were really good. Will definitely buy again."
4,5 stars on taste. Beef tastes like it was grilled before it was added to the chili. The only thing that concerns me is the 11 grams of sugar. That can't be good for you.
4,"This Chile was surprising good and not overly salty or processed tasting.  Actually a good, light and tasty lunch!"
3,"Taste is not bad and there is plenty of beans and beef.<br />Too much sodium. If you have high blood pressure, this product is a no, no."
5,"Works great,I use it for years. Do not use it everyday though,because it is strong.<br />Good to use fiber instead."
5,I. Love. Chuckles.<br /><br />and they're soooo hard to find.  damn you amazon for providing me a place to order them at WILL!<br /><br />my new diet shot to hell<br /><br />:)
5,Wheat nuts are hard to find in the stores. I was glad to find them on line.  I am very satisfied with the product and  having received them quickly.  Thankyou for such great service.
4,"Compared to a health food store, this Amazon price is far a better value.<br /><br />If you buy these, I suggest that you keep them in the sealed jar.  I had put some in an open snack dish and they absorbed this awful humidity and lost their crunchiness.<br /><br />Otherwise love these as a snack."
4,Love the product - don't know why it's not on the shelf at Sam's anymore.  Fast shipment.
5,It's a low fat alternative to all the high calorie[no good for you]snacks that are on the market and in addition it's taste is very satisfying.To say anymore would be gilding a lily
5,"guess what? the shoprite brand braided twists honey wheat pretzels are the exact same thing! They must use Utz as a supplier for them.  There is NO DIFFERENCE, I promise...so start saving and buy the shoprite ones at half price!"
5,These pretzels are so good.  I used to buy them in my local grocery store but they discontinued carrying them.  Amazon came through and I thank them dearly.  These pretzels have the best flavor and crunch!
1,This company is a sponsor of the Rush Limbaugh radio show.  This means that Proflowers pays for and profits from Mr. Limbaugh's hate speechs against women and non-Caucasian people.
5,"frozen and fresh on arrival awsome tasting highly recomend this co.,the lobster tails were as advertized jumbo and tasty,some of the best ive ever had"
5,This is by far the yummiest maple syrup we have ever tried...and we have tried many! I'm having trouble keeping my husband from over-dosing on the stuff! You can order without worry and be assured of a great product.
5,This is a wonderful tasting syrup.  Is great on pancakes as well as ham. It is well worth the money.
5,"This is a really nice, rich tasting maple syrup. Those new to maple syrup should try the B grade because it has more authentic flavor and is thicker than the lighter grades. Goes farther on pancakes and in recipes, too."
5,"This is one of the very finest maple syrups I have ordered and enjoyed. I bought the Fancy Grade, for the light amber color. It has a very great taste. I will reorder."
5,"This is our second order from Hidden Springs for maple syrup for our B&B.  If they continue with the great price and quick turnaround, not to mention great syrup, we will stay regular customers!"
5,"My wife became spoiled when we were on a fall trip with the taste of light maple syrup. It is not available in the south, so she was very happy to find it from Amazon.com. Hidden Springs is very high quality and have fast shipping. Thank You."
5,This fancy grade is as good as it gets. You will not be disappointed. This priouct supports the proud Vermont tradition.
5,"I ordered the Grade B Hidden Springs Syrup -- Grade B is my favorite for baking.  I love the strong, rich maple flavor.  This is my favorite amongst several maple syrups that I've ordered from Amazon.  Maple syrup is understandably expensive, but this syrup is a good value among its' competitors."
5,"Tastes great, and it's a quality product at a price a few dollars cheaper than the alternatives, even at our local supermarkets.  It's tough to find Grade A medium amber syrup in pints.  I'll probably just keep ordering these a few times a year."
5,"Better than the medium or dark amber grades, also would be a great gift.  Go ahead and try it.  I use it on waffles with some butter"
5,"Best maple syrup I have had.  Im not a pro and bought some at cosco and threw out what was remaining when this arrived.  I literally have been putting it into a tablespoon and eating it.  This product is ""out of this world.""  I hope the producers dont change a thing."
4,Good price for the size I wanted and great quality.  It was just what I needed for a mead project.  Items was delivered quickly.
5,We enjoy our maple syrup with waffles and pancakes on Sundays.  This is a great product made in a small farm in Vermont.  The syrup is natural and tasty.  No complaints here!
5,My husband and I are quite fussy about our maple syrup and we usually buy ours from Canada.  We ran out and decided to try this one and what a surprise it was.  The Grade A Medium Amber from Hidden Springs Maple Vermont is simply fabulous.  Great and fast service.
3,"Not as good as the reviews led me to expect. Despite great color and good viscosity, the syrup's flavor lacked intensity.  I'll continue my quest elsewhere."
5,Bought a six pack of these and like using it from time to time...it's a natural way to detox...please be advised start off easy with one cup then work up to two cups a day. I usually do this for about 10 days...then go about 2 or 3 months without this tea and then repeat. All natural.
4,"I started drinking this tea because I wanted to try something which would rid me of a persistent boil.  I was attracted by the word ""DETOX"" on the box.  I am on my second box.<br /><br />This tea is easy on the tastebuds and I believe that it is working."
4,"I read many of the reviews and had mixed feelings about this product. I am glad I decided to purchase it anyway. The tea definitely cleanses you inside and out IF you follow the packaging instructions. Plus, it tastes great. I will continue to purchase more when my supply runs low."
5,This is one of the few teas that I will always have on hand.  It is a wonderful blend of beneficial herbs that has a great taste.  I drink it almost every day.
5,but this tea taste wonderful!  I would buy it for the taste alone.  It can also be purchased at Wild By Nature.
5,I've used this tea for years off and on. It taste great for a detox type tea and I like to use it when I'm on a fast for a few days to help clean my body out. It's one of the few things I allow myself to drink while fasting.
5,This is a great tea to drink twice a day to cleanse your digestive system.  Recommend drinking once in the morning and once at night or after eating an unhealthy meal to eliminate the waste.
5,"Thank you so much for offering one of my favorite products in a cheap, bundled package. Great service and will buy again!"
5,Detox tea is good for helping to cleanse the body of most of the modern world fast paced living. Very good price and fast delivery. would buy it again...
5,"Really!<br />This stuff is pure magic for chicken, and pork.<br />I've added it to veggies, FRENCH FRIES OMG!!, beans, you name it.<br />The perfect balance of sweet, salt, and spice."
5,This rub is great stuff.  I have had several dishes that will absolutely become part of my weekly diet.  This rub completely enhances any type of potato sprinkle it on sweet potato fries or cubed new potatoes.  It adds tremendous flavor to chicken and ribs great for a variety of things.  MKS
1,"I bought this based on the rave reviews posted previously -- but one of the main ingredients is MSG. There's gotta be a way to make a good BBQ rub that's not loaded with the stuff, which gives me and my wife nasty headaches......."
5,This is our family's go to BBQ spice. We highly recommend it and have shared in many extended family stocking over the years.
5,Just put those in the fridge and have them with your coffee - nothing beats that
5,Purchased this tea because of recommendation. Product arrived well packaged and quickly. I am very pleased with this product and will purchase it again.
4,I have tried this product before and I really love it. The price is fair and I enjoy it...
4,The tea is good and fresh. We enjoy it. The shipping is fast and cost is reasonable.<br />I recommend this product.
5,You get enough in each package to make a good size cup of drink.  It is consistent in its flavor and the amount you get in each packet.  I have purchased it a couple of times.
4,If you don't have the time to cut up ginger and boil it for it's wonderful flavor here's an alternative.  This tea is refreshing.  True ginger flavor and punch is wonderful.
5,I have been searching in the grocery store for these caramel pops for ages!  I used to suck on the during my kids sporting events.  As good as I remembered them!
5,These are my favorites and I have reordered more than once.  Perfect for desert without all the calories and is soooo good.  Cant find these locally so go to Amazon for my candy fix.
5,"It is now 110 degrees here, so I am leery of ordering the cheese.  But it is excellent, and I will be ordering it as soon as it hits the 80's."
3,The coffee was send quickly. It was satisfactory but not as good as other Mocha Java coffees I've tasted (perhaps because I now have to stick to decafe). The company sent a sample of decafe Costa Rican coffee which was very good.
5,"Costco stopped carrying this near me, so when I found out it was on amazon for cheaper, I was so excited.<br /><br />It came pretty quick, was at an unbeatable price, and was the same good hot cereal I got from the Costco (no damage or anything)."
4,Good stuff! and I like the fact that buying like this results in much less packaging.
5,"Found this cereal at Costco originally.  Was happy to see it here on Amazon.  Been eating this every morning for two years, and it still tastes great.  Very healthy."
5,"I have been receiving this product from Amazon for more than a year from Amazon, because I can't buyit around here.  Not only does it taste good, the flaxseed and pumpkin seeds have helped me raise my good cholesteral."
4,This cereal is good and will get you full and satiated. It is best mixed with a lighter cereal otherwise it is too hearty and heavy.
5,I've probably ordered three cases of this stuff and eat it several days a week for breakfast.  great stuff!.  Minimal packaging.  Minimal waste.
5,"My family loves this granola!  Whether sprinkling it on their yogurt or eating it in a bowl with milk, it has a great taste!!  The 26 ounce bags are an excellent value!"
5,"Product arrived undamaged and quicker than expected; it's fresh, and excellent when stirred into plain Greek yogurt for a break-time snack!"
5,This is a great cereal if you're looking for a variety of textures and high fiber.  We love it!
5,"This granola is full of flavor, delightfully crunchy without shredding your mouth, and a very good value for your money. My husband (whose favorite cereal is Count Chocula)likes it and has been eating it every day. Can't think of a thing they should change."
5,"Best granola cereal I've ever eaten!  You don't have to soak it before eating, lol."
1,"Love this cereal, but I buy  a 35 oz box at Costco for $7,49 and sometimes am offered it with a $2 /box coupon. Its too high here"
5,"Definite an auto delivery item. Plus Nature Path is one of the companies have not been bought by large companies. Like ""Silk"" has been bought by ""Dean""."
5,"I recieved the delivery quicker than I thought I would. I was concerned with how the food item would be packaged. The Gyro slices were still frozen when I recieved them. The gyro slices were delicious, they taste better than most of the restaurants I frequent."
5,"I love a good Gyro. I order this meat all the time and it never let's me down. Some good Pita bread lettuce, tomato and any other veggie you like will make a great lunch"
3,the meat has some flavor i feel it could have a little more and also the slices are very thin so they burn quick if you dont pay attention. the cucumber sause from the same place is amazing though!
3,"I have been researching the web to find some gyro strips and this is the most expensive so far, maybe look elsewhere?"
4,"I really like this product, but haven't seen it around for awhile.  I am glad Amazon carries it. It has the most buttery taste of all the 100 calorie popcorns out there.  Very little unpopped kernels, perfect serving size bags."
5,"Great popcorn and a lot for 100 calories. Tastes great, just about every kernel pops, and it is not too salty. I will surely purchase this again and would recommend it for anyone who likes great popcorn and wants portion control too."
4,These are smaller bags of popcorn that are equal to about half of a normal sized bag. I'd prefer the normal sized packs.
4,We like Pop Secret 100 Calorie pop corn. The taste is good takes about one and a half minutes to pop and there is about 3 cups of popped corn. Pretty good snack and just 100 Calories. Good buy and price here on Amazon
4,Could have been more buttery but otherwise a great popcorn for 100 calories. It seemed to be larger than other 100 calorie popcorn bags.
5,"Excellent Product!  Great taste!  Perfect portion!<br /><br />Only 100 calories in a bag.  I microwave it for 1:30 and it comes out perfect each time.<br /><br />Fills a medium tupperware bowl.<br /><br />And it was an very good value!  Only $8.98 for 3 boxes, shipped! ONLY 30 cents for each bag!"
5,Our deployed troops love this treat as it reminds them of home. A very popular connection from home during down times.
5,Perfect bland of spices.  This is a wonderful curry powder and the quanity is generous.  It has lasted me a long time!
5,"I am not generally a fan of Starbucks regular coffee--or most coffee, for that matter--but this is delicious!  Light and flavorful, not grainy at all.  I only add skim milk and yet it's creamy and sweet.  I wish they made the blonde in decaf, too."
1,This soup is very very sweet.  They left out the salt but it is full of sugar.  There is 14 grams of sugar per serving with two servings in a can.  Too sweet for me.  Also there is dairy butter in it so it is not vegan or for someone with dairy allergies.
1,"This is awful.  So, I got out the pots and pans and made a great no salt, little sugar and no butter fat tomato Soup using fresh tomatoes.  Tastes much, much better than this Tomato Soup!"
5,My husband had a stroke and needed no salt products to keep his blood pressure down.<br />Health Valley no salt soups are great!  They have low sodium and also taste great!
5,I'm on a low sodium diet and this still has plenty of taste without salt
1,This is not the product I received.  They changed the product.  It now has chunks of tomato in the soup.  This is not what I wanted.
5,"I LOVE this soup!  I have right sided heart failure, and need to watch my salt intake.  This soup is as close to 'Tomato Bisque"" by Campbell's, as you can possibly get.  You need to try this :)"
5,Since I have to watch my sodium I have looked for a very low sodium soup for quite awhile.  Campbell's made one but no longer does.  If you had tried theirs this one is far tastier and better.
5,Hard to find at my local grocery and Amazon has a deal on 12 cans that come periodically throughout the year.  GREAT idea.
1,Actually I can't remember a time when I tasted anything so bad. I really could not believe it was meant to be eaten. Cannot imagine anyone liking this.  It did give me a good example for my daughter why it is important for her to take her health seriously.
5,"This is a good alternative to pasta sauces if you are supposed to lower your salt intake.  Spaghetti, lasagna, etc."
5,"This smelled so good it drew a crowd in my newly wheat free kitchen ..everyone liked it from 40 -8.. It is not the creamy kraft mac and cheese, but it has a great smell and flavor,  and we came back and bought more.."
5,My 10 year old daughter has alot of food allergies.  Two of them are gluten and milk.  This is as close to Mac and cheese that we have found.  We both thought it was very good.  We added tuna to it.  We will definitly be buying more.  Keep adding new products to your line.
5,Even though it doesn't taste exactly like regular mac-n-cheese it is a very tasty product.  My child who has many food allergies was extremely excited to be able to eat mac-n-cheese again.  It is very delicious.  We've made it many times.  It packs well in a thermos for lunch.
5,"I eat this all the time, it is SO good. Even though it says cheese, it is actually dairy free, but the taste is just superb!"
4,"My 6 year old is on the GFCF diet and is picky. This is definitely not mac & cheese, but the flavor is similar and he gobbled it up. He can have ghee because it's casein free & I think that made a big difference in the flavor. I'm happy to have another thermos meal for his school lunches."
4,These beans are a good find as none of our local stores carry any dried pink beans!
5,"This was a great sampler of green coffee to roast.  I haven't tried them all yet, but I liked the variety of regions and it really was a great product for a great price!"
5,I love these snacks!  Great variety of flavors all mixed into one bag.  I also send them to our troops in Afghanistan and Iraq and they ship so much better than chips.
5,Makes for a great snack both at work and at home.  Glad to be getting this shipped to my front door every two months.
5,"My son has missed peppermint patties for over a year, these honey mints are FABULOUS and he loves them too.<br />Allergy free goodness!"
5,"I tried these because a friend had allergies (I don't) but I am hooked. The honey goes down ""smoother"" than the sugar in regular mint patties. These mints are yummy!"
5,I got these from a local bee keeping specialty store in Sacramento... they are SO GOOD. I came online to see if I can get them for less! Highly recommended for fellow food allergy sufferers!
1,"I ordered 18 bags of York Pieces for wedding favors, half of the bags were melted and Amazon has a no return policy on food items. I would not order food products from a online vendor again."
4,"If you like mint chocolate, or York Peppermint Patties for that matter, then there's no reason you won't like the taste of these.  They're just like eating M&Ms but with minty freshness added to them.  4 stars because I think these candies are overpriced for what they are."
5,I absolutely love this tea!  It has a great mild taste to it.  The fact that is decafinated is a great plus!  I highly recommnend this tea!
5,Just rec'd these yesterday and not only was the shipping super speedy but the candy was extremely fresh! Will order from again without hesitation!
5,"i found these in california  and i remembered them when  i was a kid.  they dontsell them in florida<br />(where i live)  so i bought them  on amazon, and whenever my children visist me of i go west, i load up on them.<br />nothing better!!!!"
5,"I first tried this tea when it came in a Numi sampler set that my daughter brought me for Christmas. I tried it and fell in love with it. Only problem is that no store in the area carried that tea so I ended up buying it online at Amazon and the price was fair, tea is amazing."
3,Have generally enjoyed this product over a few years-but found that one container (of 6-1 lb. size that I was shipped) so far had quite inferior ghee-with the milk fat still present-made me a bit sick-and threw away rest of container.
5,"I initially bought this for my hair (crazy I know)after seeing it on a hair forum.  When it arrived, I chickened out and used it for cooking.  I am from Haiti and I use this on almost everything.  It has a slight nutty taste, easy to use."
4,"Absolutely loved this product, loved the variety. My granddaughter and I are sampling each one. She likes the mini kernels."
5,I love this flavor. The don't sale is specific flavor in the stores here in Missouri. I love it :)
1,"the lime flavor is too much, didnt think it would be so strong. its ok but there are much better flavors to be had. would not buy again."
5,Taken is taken but after you have a lot of different kinds you tend to establish a taste favorite. Basically if the price is good go for it.
5,"I stumbled onto these and decided to give them a try.  I'm so glad I did... they're delicious!  You would never know they're fat-free.  The calories are lower than in other brands, and the taste is far superior.  Try them!"
5,They taste slightly different from what I remember of Fig Newtons (obviously distinct).  I was a little surprised at first; it seemed maybe a little more clay-like?  And then they grew on me.  They're addicting.
4,These are a healthy altrnative to cookies. THey taste great and area a pretty good value I recommend to anyone looking for a healthier cookie but still has the taste you are looking for in a dessert treat.
5,We've used this food for over 4 years and my dog loves it. It's healthy and keeps her coat shiny and her belly full!
5,"It's all it's cracked up to be. I will be ordering more when I run out. The product came in the mail, on time, and in good condition."
5,"This grain is an excellent substitute for rice.  it only takes two cans of chicken broth to one package of Quinoa to make a lot of very tasty and filling finished product which can be used with gravy, sauce, mixed vegetables or anything you like."
1,"This quinoa has to be rinsed!  I would not have ordered it if I had known that.  There are many other brands for the same price that DON""T require this annoying and messy step."
5,Our local coffee shop uses this mix and it's great. I have been thinking about buying some for home but I was wondering if someone could post the nutritional information for me.<br /><br />Thanks!
5,I ordered Soozies Doozies Soft&Rich Cookie Gift Tin for my daughter for Easter.<br />She loved them because they were FRESH and made with ALL NATURAL INGRIDIENTS.<br />I would purchase them again.
5,My kids love this soup and I love having a few on hand. It's a reliable meal with some toast and cheese. I often add tofu to it to bump up the protein and they never notice.
3,"Although I loved the ease and price of making this purchase online, when it arrived over half of the cans were very severely dented.  A few so much so that it was almost impossible to order them.<br /><br />I definitely have to reconsider where I purchase this in the future."
1,"I like this coffee, but $37 for two 12-ounce bags? I can get it online from Walmart or even from my local grocery store for $7-9 per 12-ounce bag. Geez."
5,My papillon has been eating this for a while and loves it.  It was easy switching from his previous dog food (purina of some sort) and he took to it right away.
5,"I'm a fan of Virginia peanuts, and Virginia Diner does some of the best.  These are peanuts that haven't been fancied up -- not very salty, no artificial flavors, and no oily feel to them.  You get that wonderful, pure peanut taste.  Another plus?  They're BIG."
5,"For some unknown reason, the price for this item jumped from $17.48 to $45.44 within just two months. Perhaps the outrageous jump in price was due to the demand of 1.3 billion Chinese. Keep it, seller."
5,"I have to admit that these Kashi bars are fed to my sheep as treats, and they love them. I, on occasion have one, and enjoy them as well."
4,The granola bars are pretty decent. They bars are lightly honeyed so it is not too sweet but still sweet enough. The bar is well textured and contains bits of nuts with the flax. 72 bars of it might be a bit much but it is definitely manageable as it lasts a decent amount of time.
2,"Gimme better ingredients (KIND/Larabars) for more $ or sweeter items (genuine junk) for less $. Not sure I'd invest in a single bar again, let alone this size."
5,This is 72 for the price of like 24 at the grocery store. If only this were eligible for subscribe and save then it would be perfect. I would not be surprised if the price were to double soon. But I must say these are really good and at a good price.
1,"I found the tarallini to be crumbly and have an unpleasant stale taste. My previous experience with tarallini was different, they were crunchier and not crumbly. Whether this is a specific mediterranean recipe, I don't know, but I would not buy this product again."
5,"I wasn't a soba fan before, but when I tried this I became a fan! Just cook for 5 minutes and drain, served either cold or hot, good with just simplest soba soy sauce!"
4,I was looking for an additional source of protien. These are easy to incorporate into other foods and even shakes. Great for vegans. They taste great on top of salads or yogurt .<br />A good source of omegas too.
5,"These tasted fresh and nutty, and I am happy with them.  I eat a few tablespoons daily right from the bag, which I keep in the fridge after I open it.  Great product."
5,"These are nutty delicious, and well packaged.  I put a couple tbls in a fruit shake every morning and I get to enjoy the flavor, clean energy and satisfaction of hunger with them.  Thanks hemp."
5,"these are the tastey way to get hemp proetein into your diet my family & I put them in Salads,cookies,breads . I ordered the pack of 3 to be sent every three months seems just about right for my family of 5."
5,Just as I have expected. The order arrived shortly after I placed the order and the product is fresh. I higly recommend this product.
5,I used the hemp seeds every morning with my protein shake. The taste is great and they are so healthy!!!
3,"these are great tasting candies for a sugar-free variety, but they get sticky and very hard to take out of the individual wrappers, especially without getting the candy all over your fingers."
5,"I have a pretty finicky feline. I was a little nervous about trying something new, but it was recommended to me. It has been a huge hit. I don't feed canned food daily, and now she really wants it daily. She absolutely loves it. It is a great price and a great food."
5,"My Sphynx cat loves the food but he has an allergic reaction to it. It makes him cough/choke intermittently over the course of a few days.  He has this same reaction when he drinks milk.  So, I will find some other cat to share the product with."
5,Delicious! So glad I found these cookies!! Softer than your average gluten free cookie with no after taste. They can be addicting!!
5,I'm completely satisfied with this purchase of individual packs of almond nuts.  Have ate about 5 bags by now and everyone is delicious with no bad nuts.  Can't think of anything bad with the whole deal.  The bag sizes are perfect for an in between meal snack and are are really healthy for you.
5,"i'm addicted to nuts, i know it sounds funny but i am and these are no exception but i thought i'd let everybody know that they are unsalted which doesn<br />t bother me one bit but my children prefer the smokehouse ones that have salt on them. i will buy again."
5,"These are great! Ridiculously addicting!<br /><br />Good Sense makes some of the best Yogurt Pretzels around. The 9 ounce bags are perfect. I keep a bag at work and with the built-in seal, they always taste fresh."
5,"They are soooo good!  I am so addicted to these pretzels.  I am having to control myself from eating more than a bag a day.  I  hope Amazon continues to have them and doesn't quit carrying them.  Order them now, you won't regret it, but your waist line might!  :)"
5,All I can say is that our two dogs love these things almost more than anything else. They each get one a day and very much look forward to that special time. These long lasting treats are well worth the money for us.
3,"My basenji, Lily, loves Rawhide Munchy Sticks Beef 5"" 100 Pack and Chicken, 5"" 100 Pack best, but these are a great deal and she will chew happily on these as well.  I guess she is not too picky."
1,"This tin must have been sitting on the shelf for a decade; it was totally dried out when I opened it.  When treacle sponge pudding dries, it smells nasty and can't be reconstituted, even with water and some heat.<br /><br />Total waste of money."
5,"These are, hands-down, my favorite potato chips.  They are very light and flaky with a hint of vinegar that make them simply irresistible."
5,I like this product because it is a very fast working product.  It works every time and you know what to expect. No unexpected emergencies.  Very smooth!!
4,Several people recommended this tea to me when I was on a high protein diet and things got stopped up.  I do not love the taste (sort of licorice) but after adding a sweetener I liked it better.  It is effective.  Sip it in the evening.
5,"It is indeed a ""rich and creamy chocolaty delight"" if you use the smallest cup size on your machine.  Remember to shake the box well before using.  Some cocoa still remains in the K-cup after brewing, but regardless, you get a very satisfying cup of hot cocoa!"
5,"This is a fantastic soy based product that's not too sweet, is very smoothe, and wonderfully chocolaty.<br />i highly recommend this."
2,"It is so watery and weak, I had to brew the smallest cup and then put in another pod to get a full cup of hot chocolate.  This makes the pods very expensive and not figure friendly.  Each pod is 60 calories, so a full cup would be 120.  Will not purchase anymore."
5,Very tasty.  You do need to remove the top and scrape out the remaining cocoa to really get all of the flavor.  This is what we have had to do with every brand of cocoa we have bought.  The flavor is excellent.
5,My wife loves this item. She will not drink any other Hot Chocolate. The K-Cup system is great!
2,"The hot chocolate has a weird flavor to it.  I will not be buying this product again, and will probably not consider any more green mountain products."
5,"very rich chocolate taste.not too sweet,great for a cold winter evening topped with mini marshmellows. i will certainly reccomend it"
2,I used the minimum cup size to try and maximize the chocolate taste.  This did not help but if you like a weak chocolate taste then you will like it.
2,I don't like this product at all.  Much tastier and cheaper to just use hot water and a packet of hot chocolate mix from Nestle or Swiss Miss.
2,"This product would be better made with milk, which of course, then would not be for the Keurig machine. There are other brands I prefer."
2,This hot chocolate is pretty blah. Not very chocolatey and certainly not very strong. It's not the fault of the Keurig -- the Cafe Escapes Dark Chocolate is way better.
1,"Yuck...WORST ""CHOCOLATE"" I have ever had. Save your money on this brand and find another. Doesn't even taste taste like chocolate; we threw the rest away."
2,"I've been through two 24 cup boxes of this hot chocolate, and it isn't great.  It's not badly priced, and the first few sips are fine.  But after it sits for five minutes cooling in your cup it separates.  It ends up being watery for the most part with a bunch of chocolate mix on the bottom."
2,"Of course the Keurig Green Mtn Hot Cocoa is the ultimate in convenience, but, frankly, the flavor is not so hot.  Best description is slightly chocolate-flavored cardboard.  Everything else about it is fine (consistency, ease of use), but G.M. should ramp up the flavor with way more chocolate."
2,The hot chocolate is fine but the price here is crazy.  You can get the same thing on the Keurig site for under $15.
3,"I like my hot chocolate to have alot of ""chocolatey"" flavor. Even when I use the smallest size brewing cup the Green Mountain hot cocoa K-cups tastes watered down. I have to add my own powdered hot chocolate to give it enough flavor."
2,I was expecting a bit better after reading other reviews. This is about the same as any other hot chocolate made with water. I prefer making it with milk as the flavor and texture is much better. Adding milk didn't help much. I guess Mom spoiled me (good).
4,"The hot chocolate was very tasty, but pretty expensive for hot chocolate. You can buy hot chocolate K-cups in most retail stores and some grocery chains and it is the same thing for less money than advertised on here."
5,"One of the best tasting cocoa mix I have found , So easy to make just one cup for myself and the cup is<br />easy to clean with no grounds invovlved. Use with K cup lids"
5,This is a great product to put in your Keurig machine.  I use is with a cup of coffee and make a mocha.
5,Such good hot chocolate for the K Cup brewers out there!  DO NOT pass this one up!  Is not too sweet and very chocolatey :)
3,This product wad very weak! I couldn't even make out that it was supposed to be hot chocolate. Will never buy again a waste of money!
5,These are very good tasting and very fast making drinks.  The convene e of having a cup of hot chocolate in seconds and have it taste good is such a plus.
4,"The local auto shop offers this free to it customers. I've tried it twice and liked it both times. Perhaps, if I had to pay for it, I might not love the price, but I would still enjoy the flavor."
1,This product was not very good at all. It did not have the taste or consistency of the wanted beverage.
3,"I thought that getting hot cocoa would be a nice change, but after having my machine get clogged up, needing to clean the needles, and then putting a rinse brew after each cup is made, I've found it faster to stick with the packet of instant mix and heat water in the microwave."
5,"This cocoa is very good. I love it, so does my son. I actually like to mix half coffee with this cocoa, very tasty. And my son likes the flavor ,and the fact that it is low in carbs."
5,"Whole family loves this hot chocolate. We went through the entire box in less than a week. It is smooth, creamy, chocolate delight. And if you combine it with a k-cup of coffee it makes a perfect cafe mocha! Must buy more, more, more..."
5,When I got my coffee maker there were only two cocoa cups in the mix of coffee.  How delighted I was for Amazon to offer 24<br />  cup purchases.  Really great idea!
2,"Even though the little ones liked this product, I thought it was bland and not much flavor to it.  I will not buy more of these."
1,"This time, forget ordering through Amazon.  You can get the same product, 24 K-Cups for $12.75 at Big Cat or for $14.80 at Keurig.  These prices are a rip off."
2,I used the small cup setting and even opened up the cap and scraped the excess mix out of the cup and it is still very weak tasting.
4,"I am diabetic and I don't like artificial sugar, but I really like this hot chocolate.  Sweet enough and also has enough chocolate flavor.  I love it."
5,"I love this cocoa. I place it in my Kurig with 1/2 C of water, make the cocoa and add another 1/2 hot milk...so creamy, great taste. It is still good with water but the milk adds a creamy texture..YUM"
3,"I would not order these K-cups again.  Maybe I'm spoiled with Godiva hot chocolate, but I think Swiss Miss hot chocolate has more chocolately flavor than these K-cups and I wouldn't waste my money on these.  It comes out a pinkish color that is not appetizing at all."
1,"Even after shaking the cup and only using 6 ounces of water, this ""hot cocoa"" (pretty sure there's not a lick of real chocolate in it) still tastes horrible."
5,I received my product in a timely fashion and was exactly what I expected! I would recommend this to anyone!
5,I have been looking for these great candies for years.  Every now and then I would come across them in a candy store.  It is so nice to know I can now order them on line at Amazon and always have Honees on hand to enjoy and share with others.  I love the honey filling. Try them. JANE
5,"If you miss and crave the Honey Pine Brothers cough drops, you are going to LOVE the Honees Honey candy. I also love that they are imported from Italy. It's nice to see something other that ""Made in China""!"
5,"Been looking for these for 15 years, so glad I finally found them, Just like I remembered from my childhood. :-)"
5,I love these. They're just the right amount of sweetness and I really enjoy the fact that each piece is individually wrapped.
4,LOVE THEM !<br />It took me forever to find these.<br />Everyone who I have given them to to try has loved them & want MORE!<br />Shipping is on the high side though.
5,Just a perfect transaction. I can't buy this candy anywhere in my town so this was a great find.
5,"All Tom Douglas rubs are great, but I have no idea why they're listed for $25+ here. You can buy them for about $6 in Seattle grocery stores or at Tom Douglas' website."
5,This cereal is awesome and our very favorite of all of the Nature's Path Cereals.  We love it and buy it in multiple boxes!
4,"I really enjoyed this product. It tastes good and is very close to the Russian or Iranian versions. Also, the service and quick delivery were an added bonus.  I would highly recommend this product."
3,"Guys, do you know what ""malossol"" means in Russian?<br />""Lightly salted"".<br />This particular caviar was actually over-salted quite a bit.<br />Other than that its a very good tasting caviar (I guess you can blame a puddlefish for that), very close to Russian Sturgeon's caviar."
5,Received this item as expected - if anyone has had peanut porridge - this is  as close as it gets to Jamaica !
5,"Good deal, better than buying at the local craft store and even better than the online cake supply stores.  Item arrived as promised and will be useful when making Spider and Turkey cupckaes during the fall baking season."
3,"This product does not smell very well to me.  In fact, I have to use a fork to ""tenderized"" the pieces for my old kitty cat."
5,my cat loves this  first time I have found a cat food that he will eat and every time i go in the kitchen he thinks<br />its time to eat
5,"This Cat food is very delicious that my cat loves the product. Every time I open the pouch, my cat will come wanting to eat it. Please try this product with your cat if you have not done so yet. It is good for cats that are picky eaters."
5,"My finicky cats are difficult to please particularly when it comes to their food.<br />Boy,....was I finally RELIEVED...when they chowed down on these!!!"
3,I bought this product because my older cat stopped eating the wellness dry and wet food I usually fed her.  She likes this food and she begs for it every morning and evening when it is time for her meal.  The ingredients are not quality ingredients but this food is keeping my kitty satisfied.
1,I adopted a 12 yo cat from a woman who had a premature baby with a lung condition.  She's skinny and will eat very little besides Wiskas.  I think it's Soilent Green for cats.  I would never feed this to her if she would eat anything else.  I don't think she's long for this world!!
5,"My mom had gotten some of the dollar store knockoffs - they weren't bad and they certainly were cheap, but the look on her face when I gave her these was worth every penny.<br /><br />Although, I think she's managed to eat most of them in a couple of weeks and still stays 120 lbs... LOL"
5,"As you can see by the pic I posted, you get your moneys worth!!  I am very happy with my purchase!!  They are exactly as described and delivered fast!!  I have already purchased another one!!  :)"
5,Great cheese. Wonderful flavor. Made my spaghetti & meatballs better than it's ever been & made the lasagna even better. Fast delivery.
5,"This product is the absolute best for bar-b-queing meat, the roasted garlic turns the trick. It's a little pricey (about twice as much) but Amazon did have a nice discount that makes it more palatable."
5,My husband has used this seasoning for years.  We bought it through Sam's then could never find it again. I thought why not look on Amazon and as usual there it was. I love this site!  The bottles are large and well worth the money. It's just the best seasoning!
5,"This is a great spice for almost anything. We use it on meats, in soups and it makes a spicey garlic bread. We have been using it for some time and will continue to use it."
5,"<a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001EQ5536"">Durkee Roasted Garlic Seasoning Blend, 21-Ounce Containers (Pack of 2)</a><br />This Seasoning turns any meat or vegetable into a tasty treat."
5,Wonderful product!  Thank goodness Amazon has this as it is hard to find in my area.  A little goes a long way.
4,This was the first time I had quail. It was done for passover.The quail was a great addition the to lamb .
5,I would rate Starbucks ready brew coffee quite high.  They are very easy to use and I like the flavor a lot.  I use them at work where I only want one cup of coffee and hate to have to use and wash my whole coffee pot.
5,I am a major coffee drinker. I love this coffee. It is my favorite instant coffee. You can't even tell it's instant. I recommend this to anyone who likes coffee and would enjoy the conveinence of having it ready in an instant!
5,"I'm nursing and miss having coffee so much!<br /><br />I heat up skim milk in the microwave, pour some agave and a pack of Starbucks VIA decaf.<br />It tastes soooo good like a latte!"
4,"If Starbucks had a Decaf Tassimo, I'd pass this up.  Howeever, they do not.  So I use it to make ice coffee.  Pretty good, although I would have preferred another drak roast over Italian Roast."
5,"We live out of the country and if you can believe it... there are NO STARBUCKS anywhere near us.  When friends come to visit us, we ask them to bring us a supply of VIA Ready Brews.  It's almost as good as the freshly brewed.  It has a great aroma and big taste.  We love it!"
5,I recommend using half water and half skim milk. I usually mix 5 oz water with 5 oz skim milk and heat in the micro for two minutes.  Add the packet and sugar or sweetener.  Great for a quick cup of coffee without the hassle of cleaning the machine.
4,"I bought this to keep in my desk at work, as our coffee is pretty bad! As long as you don't use too much water (anything over 8 oz), this makes a fast flavorful cup. I much prefer this to Sanka, the other instant alternative offered at work."
5,"Great and simple product. Is replacing my k-cups and goes with me everywhere. Simple, fast, convenient, affordable and so much better than most products out there. You wonder how long before there is some serious competition."
1,Don't waste your money. Buy the real cup of coffee and spend the time and money at a coffee shop.
2,This is the very worse BBQ suace I have ever tasted and bought. I saw the man v Food  show which featured the stomach bile tasting thin sauce and then bought it ...wow  Texas really doesn't know BBQ sauce.
5,"Great food, my Lab puppy loves it, veterinarian recommended<br /><br />free shipping with amazon prime / no tax / 20% less than petco = priceless"
5,"royal canine is a great product Jake loves it he is now 3 months<br /><br /><a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001VIY9KW"">Royal Canin Dry Dog Food, Medium Puppy 32 Formula, 30-Pound Bag</a> old and 35  pounds boxer puppy"
5,Great food! We have a english bulldog and he loves his food! Healthy for him.. it was suggested by the breeder we bought him from.
5,"I was very pleased with the shipping of this item. When I thought it was going to arrive after my food was empty, it had actually come 2 days prior.  My dog couldn't be happier"
5,"This is wonderful. If I could have given the honey granules a 10 I would have. It tastes great, no sticky mess. My grandkids say that the taste is ""magic"" in their hot cereals."
5,"Product was shipped ultra quick - USPS priority. Packaged in no-tamper bag. This granulated honey is great in oatmeal, cooking, coffee, tea, on cereal, etc. It's sweeter than sugar. I give seller an A+++++"
5,"I use this as a replacement in recipes that call for sugar, makes wonderful cakes and cookies!  I have never had any problem with my orders."
5,"sky is the limit with this stuff. i've used it in rubs, marinades, baked goods & salads. it is a permanent addition to my spice rack."
5,"This Honey Granules is tasty and a welcome alternative to Cane Sugar. I use it in my morning oats (steel cut oats), Bird's custard and Tea. One or two teaspoonfuls go a long way. It is better stored in the refrigerator. Consider it in place of over-processed store bought cane sugar."
5,I wanted to try this type of powered Honey for my tea it is very good and a great alternative to Sugar works very well in Tea.
5,this honey was very good used it in cookie recipe like brown sugar and the cookies came out delicious. Thank you
5,I like to use honey a lot but sometimes it is difficult to use liquid gooey honey.  Honey doesn't produce the negative effects in my system that sugar does.  I use this granulated honey in many foods that need sweetened; and even in my coffee. It is great tasting and works great.
5,"THIS IS A WONDERFUL PRODUCT. USE IT IN EGGS, MEATLOAF, SPAGHETTI SAUCE, EVERYTHNG. I'VE EATEN THEM OUT OF THE JAR.:o)))"
5,"When I need to cook some onions and peppers without having to saut&eacute; them first, this is perfect. They taste great and add so much delicious flavour to food."
5,"I cannot find this product in my local stores, but did find them on Amazon.  Price is what I expected from my last grocery store purchase.  Only thing I wished they used the USPS ""flat rate"" shipping.  Otherwise I'm completely satisfied and will purchase again in the future."
2,"Give yourself the gift of buying the regular skippy.  Although this gives you less fat, there is a distinct taste difference.  We will eat what we purchased but I am still in disbelief that such a minimial amount of fat reduction in a product really makes a great PB turn into a yuckky PB..."
5,"This is my favorite pb.  It is really full of peanut taste, and I feel that it is reduced fat because there is less oil added."
5,Me and family love this brand of Peanut Butter. Cant stand the tast of others. And enjoy the free sjhipping from amazon.
2,"I like creamy peanut butter, however this is hard to spread because part of the oils are kept out to make it reduced fat. Kinda makes for a messy sandwich."
5,I have always been a fan of Skippy peanut butter and I love that Amazon is offering buying in bulk at a great price! It is cheaper here than what I find in the store. I highly recommend it as long as you have a place you can store the extra cans.
5,This is the best reduced fat creamy peanut butter I've tasted. My whole family loves it.  We it by the case.  Great food!
5,This is the first Redued-Fat Peanut Butter that I have thought was a good peanut butter.  I will buy it again when this is gone.
5,"I do not buy this because of the fat content, I honestly find that it tastes better than the Skippy full fat- and does not get those oily collections that the full fat gets. Highly recommend this product if you love peanut-butter."
5,This is the only peanut butter that I eat.  I love the low fat Skippy.
5,This PB tastes good and is goood for you! It makes good sandwiches. I only wish it were in stock more often!
2,"For the uninitiated, 'evaporated cane juice' is just sugar by another name. Another product that tries to present itself as healthy, but isn't really...eating something that lists sugar as the second ingredient isn't what I would consider to be a healthy start for the day."
5,Almost every morning I reach for the Organic Hot Oatmeal Hemp Plus.  It has more body than the typical grocery store instant oatmeal.  It is rich in whole grains and full of fiber.  It is not too sweet; I usally add a teaspoon of my favorite sweetener.  I highly recommend this product.
4,I like it a lot!  Great taste ... not too sweet.  Perfect way to start the day!
5,"Very yummy!! I used to eat the variety pack from this same brand, but I love this flavor so much I eat it every day. It's especially yummy with coconut oil added in. Love Nature's Path!"
5,I ordered these nuts off a whim because of the flavor. I just got into eating more nuts because I don't get enough Omega 3's. Everybody that I shared these with loved them! I went through 2 containers in a week (because of sharing). This will be a staple in my house from now on!!!
5,"These have more net carbs than the Emerald Cocoa Roast almonds (6g vs 3g), but if you're not worried about that, these are absolutely delicious! If you like flavored nuts, you've got to try these."
5,I got these at my local Publix. They're the best tasting almonds of the bunch. The butter toffee tastes natural and the almonds are of good quality. They also make dark chocolate covered almonds. They taste like Cocoa Puffs but are still pretty good if you're looking for a cocoa kick instead.
3,"OK, I like a little richness. These nuts have a flavorful salt taste, but are almost too dry to get down your throat."
3,"I love these almonds. They are my favorite to date and I would definitely buy again. The taste is crunchy, they are well toasted and the salt that has been added is just perfect. Not too little, not too much. Best I have ever eaten!!"
5,"These are the best tasting almonds. I buy them in bulk to share at work. Any time someone finds cheaper almonds, they always come back to these because they can't be beat."
1,"I purchased 2 other types of Blue Diamond almonds on the same day, and they were both around $11 for a pack of 3. T his one was only ONE 8 oz. container, and I assumed it was at least 2-3 containers since the cost was over $8."
5,Nice sweet treat with some nutritional value. These are fantastic! The only thing is I can find them in more local store at a lower cost.
5,Ive had some tasty nuts before but these are exceptionaly good. try them ! im very happy with this product
5,"These almonds are my favorite almonds.  Wal-Mart used to carry them, but now I have to order online.  They are the perfect balance of cinnamon and sugar without being overpoweringly sweet."
5,"I love these for a snack. I get a nice taste of chocolate and mint (in addition to the almond, of course), but it isn't super sweet. I hope Blue Diamond keeps coming out with more flavors. The Butter Toffee is great too."
5,Great taste.  The Blue Diamond flavors are way better than the Emerald flavors.  Great between meals snack that we all eat.  Also grab to put in baggies for lunches.
5,These are our absolute favorite almonds and love that there isn't any fake sugars in them.  I'll take more calories with real sweeteners any day over sucralose in the other brands. And this flavor is DELICIOUS.  YUM!
5,"these are a good thing for you and sometimes hard to find in a larger container at the store, so these make it much easier and there a good price here."
5,"The almonds tastes all right. Since it is too dry, the salt can hardly stay on surface. Therefore, it is not salty enough. On the whole, it is a healthy snack. I hope this type of almonds can have subscription service and discount."
5,It seems impossible that there is a healthy snack that tastes like cinnamon brown sugar but they've managed to do it.  I love these and I always have my cabinet stocked.  This quenches my sweet tooth without gulit.  I highly recommend it.
5,Do buy the almonds.  Great for snacks and travel.  The contanier has a close top which is great for storage.
5,Great flavor.  I snack on these when I need a boost of energy.  They help satisfy cravings between meals.
5,This almond product is wonderful!  I am so excited to have healthy options that curb my sweet tooth.  It has on 5 sugars for an ounce of almonds.<br /><br />Wahoo!
5,"These almonds taste good, not as well flavored as the cinnamon or vanilla flavored but a decent change of pace.  A little plain though."
5,I love these almonds!  Wish they sold them somewhere locally so I didn't have to buy them in bulk over the internet.
5,If you are an almond fan like me and like sweets as well this is a great treat.  And healthy as well.
5,"These almonds are fantastic!  I can't find them locally, so I'm glad Amazon sells them (comes to under [...] bucks a bottle).  The only thing better?  <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000ZSV556"">Blue Diamond Natural Oven Roasted Almonds Vanilla Bean, 8-Ounce Jars (Pack of 6)</a>"
5,"Compared to what I pay at the normal grocery store for almonds, these are priced great, and taste fresh and crunchy. The sea salt taste is perfect, and the containers are conviently sized."
5,"This is an excellent product.  I tried a handful that a friend had and I was hooked!  It has good flavor without being too salty.  You can also chop them and add to salads or in green beans.  My kids enjoy them also, good alternative to junk snacks!"
5,"Love these - very flavorful and wholesome.  I'm hooked!  Unlike the heavily oiled/salted/roasted almonds found in most grocery stores, these actually taste like real food."
1,"These gave me a headache, too much sugar, and other ingredients that didn't sit well.  I would not recommend to someone trying to eat healthier."
5,Great taste.  Almonds are high in overall fat but low in saturated fats that most contribute to weight gain.  Buy a case; they stay pretty fresh when sealed for 6 months
5,"These taste exactly like cinnamon toast crunch, but with the nutritional composition of almonds. They're pretty mind blowing. Don't be afraid of buying a 6-pack; you'll need it."
5,"Sugar coated almonds...why do you even need a review.  If you like almonds and sugar, you'll like these.  If you don't, you won't."
2,"All the 5-star reviews convinced me to buy these...I wish I hadn't :(  It's been two months since I purchased them and I still have four out of the six containers unopened.  They're just blah.  Now the chili lime flavored almonds from Blue Diamond, on the other hand, are Mmm Mmm good!"
2,"The delivery was extremely quick, the packaging was fine, and if you suck off all the honey, the almonds even taste pretty good. but i for one do not like this flavor. Mind you, I could eat 3095826 honey roasted PEANUTS."
1,I am looking for a replacement for Coca Cola and I read the positive reviews here and decided to purchase at my local Whole Foods. There's a gross stevia aftertaste and it tastes nothing like commercial cola; it's not good and it's misnamed.
1,"This is a rip off.  Found out that you can buy this product for under $2.00 just about anywhere, not the $7.99 they charge.  In fact you can go directly to the manufacture and order.  Do not get rip-off."
4,"Delicious!<br />Ideal to eat with fruit, and if you want to eat with some chips (is not too spicy) i like this very much"
5,"This is a great product and the only problem we have is the unreliability of finding it on the Grocery Store shelf. With Amazon.com, it's just a Mouse Click and three days away. We keep a supply on hand and reorder from Amazon.com on a regular basis. Thanks Amazon. Hank C."
5,The product was received on schedule and in perfect condition. I have been buying this product and brewing it for years and it is still a great product.  It is much better tasting than using tea bags.
5,"If you like their teabags, this is really worth a try. The leaves in the teabags seem to be the tea that is rejected when they package the loose tea. This tea has a brighter taste than the tea bag Lipton."
5,I love the Loose Tea. The bag tea has a harsh taste compared To the loose tea. If you drink more than 1 cup a day use a CLEAN (never used for Coffee) Coffee pot. Small 4 cup pots only need 1 tea spoon for weaker a little more for stronger tea.
5,"We have been using this product for many years of enjoyment.  In summer, my wife uses it for iced tea almost every evening for our supper.  There is some usually left over so it can be used either hot or cold at a later time, even early the following day.  We read that tea is good for the body too."
5,Its hard to beat this for making iced tea. It makes a strong tea that manages to quench a thirst on a hot day. Just dont steep is too long or it will get bitter (I find that 4 mins is about perfect.)
5,This is a great product. Shipping was fast as usual and I plan to keep on getting tea from Amazon as long as possible.
4,"I live way out in the boondocks and even the closest little town stores do not carry Liptons' Loose Tea.  I don't want tea bags for both ecological and economical reasons, so the convenience of subscribing to a scheduled shipment at a reasonable price is wonderful for me.  Thank You."
5,"As others have said, Lipton's Loose Tea is very difficult<br />to find in stores.  I prefer the loose tea to the tea<br />bags for iced tea.  I hope Amazon continues to offer the<br />Loose Tea as I try and stock up when I can."
5,"I was so disappointed to find that the two stores I shop in had stopped carrying the loose Lipton tea.  This is the only tea I use.  There is a difference between it and tea bags and I'm thrilled that I can buy it on line (and as an added bonus, it's cheaper!)thanks so much"
5,It's very hard to find this product in local grocery stores. Loose tea is something my wife and I enjoy.
5,"GREAT TEA.  IF ANYONE HAS NOT TRIED LOOSE TEA THEY NEED TO, BECAUSE THEY DON'T KNOW WHAT THEY ARE MISSING.  I WAS VERY GLAD TO FIND THIS PRODUCT AGAIN.  MANY THANKS FOR KEEPING THIS WONDERFUL BEVERAGE.  FAST SHIPMENT AND GREAT SERVICE"
5,I love this tea!!  I drink it every day of the year.  My grandma made her tea from this and its the only tea my family drinks!!
5,My family makes a lot of ice tea during the summer.  We are not able to find affordable/quality loose tea in our community.<br /><br />Lipton's loose tea is the best!
5,This is the only way to make good good iced tea. you will never taste iced tea as good as homemade and it is cheaper on amazon than in the supermarket!
5,I use a little plastic shot glass to brew 2 liters perfectly at the office. We love it. That's only a few dry grams makes 2 liters of hot tea! Can't find this in my local supermarket. Glad Amazon has it!
5,"I chose to have this tea sent to me automatically, thereby saving even more money.  It's cheaper this way than I can buy at my local store.  Loose tea made with filtered water makes the absolute best tasting iced tea!"
5,"Excellent way to make good old fashioned tea, beats tea bags ""HANDS DOWN""! Will continue to buy this product and spread the word how ""REAL TEA"" is made.:)"
5,"Good value, good tea. We've been  using it for years and it always makes a good pot of tea."
5,I love this product and can't find it locally. Thanks Amazon I turn to you for help when I can't find things in my community.
5,"We use loose tea all the time, and regular loose tea has become hard to find in our local grocery stores. This subscription is great."
5,"Fewer and fewer stores carry loose-leaf tea and I was so glad to find it on Amazon. Who knew?  I've become an avid fan of Amazon over the last few months.  It's wonderful to have someone ELSE do the ""shopping"" for me and allows me to find products in one place."
4,"Tea tastes great.  Overflows my ice tea maker, but worth it; I guess.  Tazo is better but much more expensive."
5,"This is my third order of Lipton loose Tea.  It isn't easy to find in our local stores, so I really like to be able to depend on Amazon to provide this product for me.  Excellent product and service and recommend this all."
5,Lipton tea is around $6.75 in the local gorcery store if you cand find it.
5,"The best tea for ice tea.  A little harder to use than bags, but the taste is so much better.  I make mine in an ice tea pot and it's always perfect.  I've been drinking it all my life and the quality is always wonderful."
3,Save your money and buy a better quality tea than Lipton Loose Tea.  Tea is better than the bagged version but you will want to pour it through a fine filter before drinking because the leaves are broken and some are just very small particles.
1,"This tea was supposed to be loose tea.  I purchase loose tea all the time.  Instead of packaging the tea in bags, they left it loose.  Gave a very couldy tea with a bitter taste."
5,"So far this is the closest thing to the Thai restaurant I've tried.  And though it's close, it's still not exactly the same.  It does have that one spice that other Thai teas are missing. It's really outstanding."
5,These truffles melt slowly in your mouth with a wonderful flavor and smoothness. And you want just one! The most satisfying chocolate I've ever had.  I want some NOW!
5,A drop at a time in a bowl (or pot) of chili will give you the heat level you want. I will save a lot of money on peppers for my chili. A little on a toothpick brought a fellow heat lover to tears.
5,"Yes, the final answer is YES, IT IS HOT!  Why even ask the question?  It is 1.5 million SVU, if you are looking add a little heat, this is not for you, if you want to cry yourself to sleep wondering ""WHY, WHY, WHY!!!???"", then you are looking at the right product, IT'S HOT!"
5,"Excellent product! I use a drop on everything. Suprisingly, this hot sauce actually tastes good. I expected it to just be hot, because it includes a pepper extract. But it actually enhances the flavor food, if you like hot."
5,"Warning this stuff is hot. Just adding a drop into some pho was too much, but if u like and can handle spice then this is for u, be warned thou!  Enjoy."
5,"Not for the faint hearted! This is really, really hot stuff! I tasted 1 drop on a toothpick and it burnt badly for 10 minutes. But it's all good:))))"
5,This is the hottest sauce I have ever had.  Just 1 drop in a soup makes my mouth burn for 30 minutes and I start crying.  This sauce is not for the faint of heart.
4,"Adds flavor and heat to food. Hot, but not intolerable for those who can handle spicy foods. Purchased as a gift and would buy again."
5,"This is one hot extract.  I use 1 drop in a bowl of soup and it makes it plenty hot.  I also use it to heat up my chili.  If you like it hot, but not so over the top you can't taste the food, then this is the Final Answer you've been looking for."
5,The bottle is tiny but it will go a long way!  All you need is a tiny drop on a toothpick to spice up your plate.
5,"I love the litter dropper in the lid to add just the right number of drops. It is spicy, but not too bad. For some fun try adding 4-5 drops in your next batch of brownies. It's actually really good."
3,The dark chocolates were great and the packaging was great for Christmas<br />The tin was something you dont see in America anymore.<br />Perfect to reuse for candy or other things at christmas.
5,"My mother in law loves this product.I looked at several sites and could not find it without havig to, in some cases, pay over 100$ and was so happy to find this on Amazon"
4,"There are only a few candies in this tiny box, not worth spending over $20."
5,"Just used this product in my DeLonghi EC702. Best cup of Espresso I've gotten from it so far, possibly best cup ever."
4,I like the slight pineapple flavor in this better than the plain coconut water. Good well chilled. Coconut water is supposed to be a healthy drink.
4,"Love this juice. Scheduled shipment is convenient and economical. This is a very expensive beverage and any way to save some money on it, is worth it"
5,Shipping great and loved product. The boxes are a little tough because there is not a lid if you do not finish.  I suggest buy only little ones this way.
5,Pineapple is hands down my favorite flavor of Vita Coco! It not only serves a great electrolyte replenishing beverage (aka the PERFECT hangover cure) but it can also be made into a pinacolada if you just add some rum :)
4,"I really like this coconut water, but I was surprised that per 17oz box it's the same price at Wegman's.  Probably won't be ordering again unless there's some sort of discount."
5,"Heard about this drink from a friend and had to try it. Had one while traveling and loved it!!! I sat on the plane enjoying it...I was thinking, I should bought another one!"
3,I subscribe to this monthly but just got an email stating that it's changing from 17 oz. to 16.9 oz. - but no price change?  WOW that's a really lame cut to increase their profit margins.  Whatever I won't miss the .1 oz. obviously but how about messaging and acknowledging your devoted consumers.
5,"Of all the flavors Vita Coco produces, the Pineapple combination is by far the best - it has just enough flavor to keep it interesting but not overpowering."
5,The pineapple coconut combination is refreshing. I especially like that there is no added sugar. This is a welcomed change from other brands.
5,I like this product so much I have it delivered monthly!  So happy to be drinking this at work while my co-workers are stuck with pop!  It's so refreshing and revitalizing!  The only coconut water flavor I like is pineapple!  Transports easily and stores easily with the screw-on top.
5,I always feel refreshed when I drink this coconut water. The pineapple gives it an added extra that makes it truly irresistible. It has been a firm favorite of mine now for nearly a year.
5,"I tried quite a few varieties of this brand and the pineapple is the best.  Light but refreshing.  I am not sure if I think it is a miracle elixer or anything but I did purchase a case and look forward to drinking this on a regular basis.  Thank you for the great value and convenience, Amazon."
5,I use vita coco coconut water with pineapple to mix with my ultra-meal nutritional supplement it mixes well and taste great.I have it for breakfast every morning.
5,If you haven't had coconut water with pineapple juice before then you need to try this! Simply delicious and so healthy for you!
5,Good thirst quencher. Milky and thicker then I expected. Not what I would call a pineapple flavor but one can get the idea it is pineapple.
5,Short and brief.  The product has a wonderful coconut taste and the pineapple addition is light and mildly sweet.  I will certainly purchase this again.
4,"I've always wanted to like coconut water - low in calories, high in minerals - but I've just never liked the taste much. The pineapple juice in this really makes a difference. It still needs to be well chilled to be good, but it makes a healthy post-workout drink."
5,Love the pineapple flavor. Makes me feel like I am on vacation drinking a pina colada. (You probably could add a little rum and.....)Really tastes better than other pineapple coconut waters I have tried!!
5,"This product is a good addition to fruit smoothies.  It thins it out while adding good taste and electrolytes, which are good during the very hot weather."
5,"I love this water! I started buying it after my Bikram yoga classes to rehydrate, and now drink it whenever I feel a little dehydrated.  Living in AZ, I tend to not drink enough water so these help tremendously and are delicious too!  Try them! You'll be hooked :)"
5,Vita coco water is taste great by itself or mixed up in a smoothie. It is great for re-hydration after a workout and has more potassium than a Banana.
5,IT SAYS ON THE BOX EACH DRINK CONTAINS: THE POTASIUM OF 2 BANANAS & MORE ELECTROLITES THAN A SPORTS DRINK. THEY MIGHT SEEM A LITTLE HIGH PRICED BUT GO TO GROECERY STORE BUY 2 BANANAS & 2 SPORTS DRINKS AND YOU WILL PAY MORE TO GET THE SAME NUTRITION YOU GET FROM 1 JUICE BOX OF THIS COCONUT WATER...
5,"Great before, during, and after a workout. Great natural electrolytes, Very high in potassium, amazing drink! This is my favorite flavor, tangerine is 2nd"
5,Great real coconut young coconut taste. Not the usual overwhelming sweet taste seen on other coconut water canned drinks.  Good on the environment. Made in Brazil. Even better.  You can really taste the fruit labelled on the product besides the coconut water taste
1,"I bought this at a local gas station near my house and was excited to try it because I see it everywhere. It was nasty. I will never drink this crap again, I don't care how ""good"" it is for you. The taste is disgusting and I'd rather just drink regular water. Blah!"
5,I'm so addicted to these!!! You know the movie When Harry Met Sally? When I drink one of these it just feels like that famous scene in the movie... orgasmic!
5,My 26 year old horse Little Joe loves these and they are helping him. I wish they come in bigger bags.
5,I got this for my 23 year old gelding.  He loves it and it seems to be helping him.  His appetite and joints appear to be improving. I wish they sold this in 30lb or 50lb sizes.  Then all of our horses could have this everyday.
5,"This is my favorite starbucks roast, but why dont you just go to your local starbucks to purchase this, its the same price if you just go there and you dont have to pay for shipping and handeling and all that stuff, plus they will grind it for you there."
5,"i love this coffee.  i drink it black. i drink it 7 days a week, a few cups a day in the morning.  it's bold and strong and i wouldn't want it any other way.  it's delicious.  it may not be for everyone, but i give it 5 stars."
5,If you like a strong but smooth flavorful coffee this is it. I have tried others and just keep coming back to this one. My second joice would be the Starbucks Italian blend.
5,I sent this coffee to two friends back east.  they thoroughly enjoyed getting it and said it was delicious.
2,I would not recommend this oil.  It does not have a pleasant smell and does not purify the skin.  It's just like other oils I have bought from drug stores which were cheaper.
1,Do not order this! It has absolutely no taste and was COMPLETELY disappointing!I tried to return the unopened 5 boxes and Amazon would not let me...total bummer and waste of money.
5,I put this product in my coffee & it tastes fantastic! Coffee is kindof boring without it. Excellent product & super good for you!
5,"I was so frustrated - they hooked me on this product at the local Walmart and then stopped carrying it.  I could not find it at any of the local stores, so I went to Amazon - and there it was!  I have enough to last for a good while now and it was exactly as advertised and arrived in good time."
5,Absolutely love this product. It is a nice treat for those who are looking for low calorie sweet snack. The name is perfect and says it all...Delight Bars.
5,This is the perfect snack for that 10am drop between breakfast and lunch.  It's creamy without being too sweet.  I'm so glad AMAZON offers this bar since all the grocery stores in my area have discontinued them. Give them a try!
5,"First had these in LA.  No grocery store in my area sells them.  Odd because Providence, RI is not a remote town.  Anyway, I was glad to find them on Amazon."
5,"Hi,<br />Does anyone know what the nutritional info. is on these specifically?...sugar content per bar, carbs?<br /><br />Thanks"
5,THEY ARE DELICIOUS NOT SALTY YOU CAN SIT AND EAT 2-3 2 OUNCE BAGS AT A TIME I GIVE THESE 5 STARS PLUS I HAVE TO STOP MYSELF FROM EATING THEM THEY ARE DELICIOUS.
5,"These chips are the best!! I've tried some of the other flavors and they are ok, nothing special... but the Mesquite BBQ is hands down the best BBQ chips I've ever had! if you like BBQ chips (and are not concerned with the calories most chips bring), then you will not be disappointed in these!"
5,These are delicious lower sodium/fat chips. Convenient lunch/snack size bag is enough for sharing. Halloween is two months away and the kids will be getting these for trick or treating at our house.  By the case means they're always on hand.
5,"The chips are deliciously spicy and super crispy.  It takes a second for the heat to hit but<br />when it does, it's AWESOME!  Love these chips and will continue to buy for a long time."
5,Deep river snacks are the best chips ever!!! I'm addicted to the zesty jalapeno and haven't tried other flavors. I recommend this brand to everyone.
5,These are everything I want in a potato chip; Flavor that jumps out at you and they stay crunchy!!<br />Do yourself a favor(and flavor) and try these chips!!
5,"Whole family loved 'em. Hard enough to break your teeth (in a good way, they are kettle chips after all).  24 for $17? We'll definitely buy again."
4,"These are very good chips. The Asian Sweet & Spicy--not too sweet, not too spicy, or salty--perfectly balanced seasoning. We received very fresh packages.  I just like thicker cut potato chips especially being kettle cooked, but that will not deter me from ordering again."
5,I really like these chips and so do my customers. Tangy and spicy chips with a sweet finish.  I look for 2 oz. bags like these.
5,My husband was just diagnosed as gluten intolerant and he thought his life was over.  Surprize he loved these chips and couldn't believe it.  I did too and am not allergic to foods.  Can't say enough good things about this chip.
5,I find deep river snacks everywhere but hardly ever find the cracked pepper and sea salt.  Glad that Amazon carries it.  If you like spicy and peppery these are the chips for you.
5,"I was very skeptical about buying a brand of chips I had never tasted before, much less buying it in bulk.<br />However, I had not regretted it.<br />These chips are one of the best I had tried and certainly exceeded my expectations.<br />They're reasonably priced too so that is a big plus!"
5,"This is a heavy kettle style chip that is not as ""heavy"" as kettle brand chips, but bas good flavor.  I will reorder."
5,I recently bought these chips.  Came home and only three bags were left in the box.  My whole family loves them.  They have great flavor and better and healthier than more chips. I'm ordering a few more boxes today
4,"These are not the ""same old"" chips by far and the Asian Sweet & Spicy sparked my imagination too, makes you appreciate the new and improved variety of potatoe chips. This flavor is easily an ""8"" on the ten-scale."
5,"I love Rosemary chips, but can't find any at my location. I was glad I came across these, at such a great price."
5,The potato chips are wonderfully tasty.  My sons and I both like the Rosemary and Olive Oil because it is not as spicy.  We also got the Jalapeno.  It is not so much I don't like the Jalapeno.  It is spicy hot for me.  I still love the potato chips.
5,Being what you would call a chip connoisseur was looking forward to trying these.  Great chips.
5,Very nice chips; just the right size to serve with a sandwich and watch my calories.
1,"Ingredients on Deep River Snacks's website are: Potatoes, sunflower oil and/or corn oil, whey, sea salt, onion powder, sugar, garlic powder, torula yeast, dried parsley, maltodextrix, canola oil, soybean oil, rosemary extract and ""natural flavors"".<br /><br />False adversing much?"
5,"They are a healthier chip with less salt and fat, which I like better than the over-salted regular chips on the market.  The flavor is great and they are nice and crunchy. Absolutely worth a try!"
5,Love these chips.  Good for a quick snack and I don't fee TOO guilty eating them since they have less fat and salt than regular chips.  Highly recommended.
2,The sweet Maui onion tastes like sour cream and onion.  I was hoping to get the delicious chips that I enjoyed in Maui.  Don't wast your time.
2,"The kettle chip itself is crisp, crunchy and good, although somewhat greasy.  Over coated with the flavoring causing mouth burn when it was not expected in a chip with Rosemary flavoring.  Leaves greasy, gritty residue on fingers after two or three chips."
4,"I love nestle chips, but the top of the box's bags and the bottoms were half way melted, and I couldn't find anyone in Amazon to complain to.  I really wish I could figure out where you complain to Amazon.  I know how to complain to the stores but not to Amazon itself."
5,This was great coffee and I would order this again! My husband loves this particular one because it is mild and has a great flavor as well.
2,"This lemon salt is ok, but the salt is not infused with the lemon, the lemon is mixed with salt granuals.  So might as well use lemon."
3,These are great treats - in fact they are the only thing I use for my dog.  But this price seem way wrong - so far off as to possibly be incorrect??  In my local PetSmart they are $5.99.
5,"I saw the price on Amazon, and I jumped at it!  It was a great deal compared to others that I found on the Internet.  Bought the box of Jelly Belly Tangerine Jelly Beans as wedding favors.  Great Steal!"
5,I have purchased this at Costco several times and the quality seemed to be lacking.  This purchase through Amazon was superior.  I'm not certain why there is a quality difference.  I would definitely check this out.
3,Stuff inside is good. But olive oil containers should be dark to block sunlight. And I prefer glass containers to plastic.
5,I use this in cooking and also as a skin care product. First time that I have tried olive oil as a moisturizer and I absolutely love it. This is one brand that I will buy again.It is great and gentle on the skin.
5,"This is a must have in my home.  I use olive oil for everything, my skin, hair, cooking, taking off makeup. This is great, quality organic, virgin olive oil and I'm in heaven!"
4,Coffee has good flavor but I find it to be a little on the weak side. So I use more than one bag per pot and thus removes the convenience of using bags in the first place.
5,"I am on a gluten free diet and find most gluten free snack high in calories and fat.  These cookies are awesome. The serving size is 4 cookies, calorie count per serving is between 100 and 120 and fat is between 1 and 2. Great flavor and crunch and almost healthy."
5,Finally a cookie that taste great!  If you have eaten any gluten free cookies before you know they are bland.  These cookies are AWESOME.  The best part is I dont have to worry about my multiple food allergies.  I would recommend them to anyone who loves cookies like me!
5,I love Dr. Lucy's cookies.  All the flavors are terrific.  I don't eat them because they're gluten free-I have no allergies-but I am a vegetarian who usually eats vegan.  I often crumble these (or the sugar cookie flavor) on top of a bowl of coconut milk ice cream-it's spectacular.
5,"I am on a gluten free diet and find most gluten free snack high in calories and fat.  These cookies are awesome. The serving size is 4 cookies, calorie count per serving is between 100 and 120 and fat is between 1 and 2. Great flavor and crunch and almost healthy."
5,"These cookies are great, even greater since they have no gluten, no dairy, no eggs, and are light crispy and oh so good.  This is a phenomenal price too, and I love the small snack pack size!!!! Thanks Amazon.  And thanks Dr. Lucy (who lives one town over from me!)"
2,"I bought these cookies after reading all the rave reviews but they were very dry, didn't have much chocolate, and left an unpleasant aftertaste. I don't understand what all the fuss is about. If these were the only GF cookies available, I still wouldn't buy them again."
5,The cookies are great tasting.  Especially for gluten free.  I will definitely buy them again and again.!  The consistency is like a regular chip ahoy!
2,"These cookies are small, grainy and very crunchy with an awful aftertaste. And very expensive for such a small package of 16 cookies. Might be great for multiple allergies, But I was very disappointed."
4,"For what is is, this cookie is pretty good. Does it taste like the soft, under-baked, buttery kind you get from a bakery or your favorite shoppe? No, however it does satisfy a sweet tooth. In my opinion these taste just like a ""less sweet"" version of the chips ahoy brand I ate as a kid."
5,"I love a crisp cookie that you can dip in milk. These are crisp,delicious and light and they travel well for my peanut allergic grandaughter. She's four and its a great thing when we can find things she loves and can eat without worry."
5,These are some of the best cookies I've found without allergens in them.  I love that they come individually packed so I can grab them to go or put them in my lunch.
5,My son is on a restricted diet due to allergies and he is very picky. It was hard to find things that he would even try. After tasting one of these cookies he was hooked. Now this is a favorite snack of his.
5,"Terrific flavor, good crisp texture and just the right amount of sugar sprinkles make this a winner! Lucy's cookies are my go - to<br />dessert."
5,"I bought the chocolate chip and they are delicious!! Regardless of the fact that they are gluten free, these cookies are good enough to stand on their own.<br /><br />I gave my father one to try, and he loved it. He had no idea they are gluten free."
5,"Great seller, fast shipping! I love these cookies! I have many allergies and I have no problems when eating these. I will be ordering more."
5,These are the best GFCF cookies ever! Even better than I can make at home and they are awesome for quick lunch packing!
5,"Lucy's Cinnamon Thin cookies, while a little pricy, are quite tasty.  I like to let them get slightly stale so that they are chewy, although that doesn't happen often because they are usually gone too quickly."
5,"I bought these on a whim at my local gluten free store. These cookies taste amazing!<br />To me, they taste like cinnamon toast crunch cereal.<br /><br />Unfortunately, I have a sweet tooth and need to refrain from buying every week.<br />They are just TOO tasty, I want to eat the whole box!"
5,i bought these after having them at starbucks and i loved them. im always looking for a weight watcher friendly snack and these fit the bill. they are four weight watcher plus points and are delicious.
5,"This is a very flavorful cookie with a nice texture. It is also low in Carb. I have used the crumbs from these cookes to replace a grahmcracker crust and was extreemly pleased with the results. It is my only ""must have in stock"" cookee!"
5,"Glad I gave them a try. They are expensive, but all gluten free foods I purchase are! They taste the closest to the best cookies I used to purchase before having to go gluten-free. Will purchase  again."
5,"Lucy's is one of the very few baked goods available that omits all the major sources of food intollerances -- gluten, dairy and eggs. More importantly, they are delicious. When we can't find a local source for Lucy's cookies, we always ordered them on-line."
5,"I love crisp sugar cookies, these were perfect, tasted like regular gluten cookies.  Will buy over and over."
4,These are the only glutten-free cookies I eat. They are crunchy and go great with coffee and tea.
4,My daughter loves these!  We both have gluten sensitivities so we were so happy to find these!
5,to all of you gluten free people out there who thought that you couldn't eat Chocolate Chip cookies anymore- think again!  These are so delicisious taht you won't miss the wheat!  They are the best wheat free cookies I've found.  I could eat half a box at a time but I try not to!  :)
5,"A fabulous compilation of cinnamon and crunch - sweet and glulten free! Pricey, but worth it."
5,"These cookies have a great flavor and no aftertaste that I can detect. I do not find them gritty at all. They are quite crispy, but I like that. I think they are as good as any regular sugar cookie I have ever had, and my non-GF friends agree!"
5,"I am very pleased with the light crispy texture and sweet taste - so far the best GF oatmeal cookie I have found. It does not have a traditional chewy oatmeal texture, but still great and even better available through Amazon!"
5,"Lucy's Cinnamon Thins are crispy, yummy and entirely too tempting! They taste like snickerdoodles,and I can't quit eating them!"
4,"When I first tried the cookie, I wasn't expecting it to be so crispy.  I didn't like it until after a few bites.  They definetly took care of my sweet tooth!  I would recommend these to any one with food allergies"
4,"For a store bought cookie, these are good.  Very crunchy and a good flavor.<br /><br />Even if you don't have dietary restrictions, these are worth trying."
5,"These cookies are great!  They have a slight Tapioca flour taste, but I'm very sensitive to that.  The chocolate chip ones are even better.  Thank you Dr. Lucy for a low-calorie gluten free treat."
5,"for those of us who can't digest gluten, finally there is a cookie that tastes delicious and is easy on the stomach!!!"
5,These cookies are the best.  They are very crispy and taste great with a bowl of coconut milk ice cream.  The reviewer who thought they had an aftertaste or grainy texture is reacting to something I can't taste at all; these are yummier than all the wheat-based commercial sugar cookies I've tasted.
5,"We love Dr. Lucy's cookies!  The cookies have a delightful, crisp ""crunch"", while maintaining the consistency of a regular cookie. I wouldn't have guessed they were gluten, milk & egg free! My son is hooked, as am I!"
5,"These cookies are delicious and great for a sweet treat if you are on Weight Watchers! However, they are expensive so I was thrilled to find them at a much more reasonable price!"
5,"I am on a gluten free diet and find most gluten free snack high in calories and fat.  These cookies are awesome. The serving size is 4 cookies, calorie count per serving is between 100 and 120 and fat is between 1 and 2. Great flavor and crunch and almost healthy."
1,"These are the worst gluten free cookies I have ever tasted.  They were hard, dry and tasted like tapioca flour.  Avoid these at all cost."
5,These are hands down the best roasted and salted almonds I have had.  Addictive yet healthy!
5,"I could live off of these! I'm not kidding. The regular salted almonds are good too, but I prefer the Smokehouse almonds."
4,"Very tasty and great for a late night snack, a sitting at your desk snack, and/or a traveling treat . If you're not a big fan of salty treats, steer clear."
5,Excellent flavor which we can find no where around us locally.  Ate these as children and enjoyed them so much.  Excellent light snack.
5,These things taste great but the price on Amazon swings wildly (and widely) so stock up when the prices is low.
5,"These are perfect for traveling. On the airplane when they offer you peanuts, pretzels or cookies you can take out an alternate, healthy snack. The only thing is, now I'm addicted to them, they're so good."
5,These are the best smoked almonds I have ever had. I remember getting these as a child on the airplane as a snack and have been searching for them for years. Finally found them and I will NEVER eat any other smoked almond. Blue diamond almonds are forever!!!
5,Great fresh product if you like roasted almonds.  No more frustrating attempt to buy some that match these in the grocery store. Free shipping and come to your home. Great for snacks.!
5,"I've tried a lot of almonds out there but I always seem to come back to these. Nicely sized can and a good deal here on Amazon. Lasts me a while between purchases and saves me money too. What can I say, they're delicious."
2,"These are good, though a bit too salty for my taste. But you can get these for about 40% less at any grocery store. Save your money!"
3,"If you like an almond this is a good product and it is cheaper than the name brand. To me this product taste the same as the name brand, I like paying less and having the same taste!"
3,"I should have been more aware of the price at local stores for this product.  Walgreens had these exact almonds for $2 less/per bag that week.  They are delicious, though."
5,We like these almonds and were unable to get them at our local store anymore so found them on Amazon and ordered them.
5,I've tried several other brands of roasted salted almonds available via the Internet and in stores.  The Blue Diamond brand is definitely the best tasting of all.
5,"I love the portability and taste of this snack. I wish the caloric and sodium count was less, But the protein count is perfect."
4,"smokehouse almonds are great but i just can't take all of the salt so i rub some of the salt off of them and then i go to town, if they sold lightly salted ones i would probably not only be addicted but broke as well from eating them so much love love love this product and will buy again."
5,great deal on these nuts. whole family loves these nuts. nuts for nuts. arrived fresh and tasty. great for a snack or packed in a lunch.
3,"Purchased this item to try.  Had to purchase the case, I believe 3 big bottles.  It wasn't what I expected, but now I have 3 big bottles to use.  I will share at work and with my family, if I can get them to take some."
5,"This is the best coffee I have ever had ... and I may not be a coffee expert, but I consider myself picky!  This is extremely smooth and flavorful.  I wish the price were lower & we had to sign for our package that came directly from Jamaica (hey, it is real!), but it is so worth the splurge!"
5,"Since my first trip to Jamaica, I fell in love with the coffee.  The delivery date was right on and we had Blue Mountain coffee on Christmas morning!  For a treat, try drinking it with sweetened condensed milk!"
3,I'm a big Juan Valdez colombian fan. This Jamaican stuff doesn't have the kick that I love from coffee. It's sorta flat. Especially for something I spent $75 for two lbs. Goin Back To Colombian (twang twang)
4,ITS HUGE...3 Kilos...taste is not a great as I remember but still good. more strawberry taste than a lot of American jams. I would buy again in other flavors too. Great for large families.
5,"Can't miss with this when you really want to give something special. Product famous for quality.  Delivered on schedule.  Great, practical packaging."
5,The steaks came well sealed and packaged and were delicious. The price was right too for the size and quality of steaks that came.  I would recommend getting this product for the gourmet food lover in your life.
5,"The steaks are real good & for the price u can't beat it. The store you purchase this item from is very profesional, i highly recomened this store."
1,I ordered a box of the Omaha Steaks Top Sirloins and it was like eating shoe leather. Toughest meat I've ever had.  There was absolutely no flavor to the steak and I didn't want to waste it so I gave it to my dogs
4,"GREAT, EXACTLY AS DESCRIBED, ARRIVED ON TIME, OR AT LEAST AS BEST AS I CAN RECALL NOW. MUST FIND ANOTHER WAY TO ORDER THIS POSTAGE OUTRAGEOUS"
3,I found these for 1/2 the cost on the direct website with a free gift of lava cakes as well. Makes a great gift :)
1,Lacks the flavor I was hoping for and the price was a bit high for the satisfaction level.  I won't be ordering this again.  Live and learn.
5,"This is so good in rice, on sushi, and miso soup.<br />I am making miso soup all the time now just so I can use this!"
4,"These pretzels have a good cinnamon taste and are really crunchy. They are a satisfying ""good for you"" snack as you can nibble on them for quite a while. Also have no trans fats or artificial flavors. Will purchase again!"
2,"These aren't clearly labeled ""GLUTEN FREE"". They say pretzel sticks and they do not resemble pretzel sticks very closely at all. They are a weird flavor, sort of costly and not worth it. eew."
2,"You get 12 bags for 12.00, in each bag is about a handleful of pretzels. The taste is ok but not worth a dollar a bag.."
5,Kay's cinnamon pretzels have great crunch and just enough sweetness. The protein/carb balance is comparable to Medifast. I love being able to buy Minnesota-made.
5,Love the kays naturals line.Gluten free and healthy-totally delicious!the cinnamon sticks are my favorite and the pizza flavored puffs for the savory treat. Amazing that 12 grams of protein fits in this small serving! my best find for healthy snack food.
4,I ordered 4 boxes (12 ea.) of the cinnamon pretzels.  I've had them before and knew I liked them. (Not so concerned about gluten.)  They sent me 1 box of pretzels and 3 boxes of cinnamon cookie bites.  I think the shipping department can do better.
5,These soy based pretzels are a little sweet and contain protein which makes them perfect for a mid afternoon snack.  They help cure the munchies and hold off the appetite until suppertime.  Love them and keep a constant supply on hand.
5,"I try to follow a somewhat low carb diet and find that these pretzels fit the bill as far as satisfying my need for a carby crunch.  I really enjoy all of Kay's chips and pretzels but keep in mind that, of course, there will be textural and taste differences from the ""real"" thing."
5,That's what they taste like to me. I gave them to a friend of mine who agreed they taste like French Toast. Great high-protein snack!!
2,"The freshness is great during the initial crunch but once the chewing and swallowing takes place, these pretzels are very earthy and grainey tasting...I have several bags you can have for free."
5,"Great Deal, I have checked around and you have the best deal, that I have found, on the ""Kay's Naturals pretzel sticks"".<br />These are a good source of protein, crunch and great price.<br />thanks muchly"
5,Since losing weight my snacks have become far and few. With these I can have low calories and high protein. I love the taste.
5,"I have a yorkie who even after having her teeth cleaned at the vet, use to have horrible breath and hair that matted very easily. Since changing her dog food, she no longer has the horrid breath and her hair looks and feels fantastic! I will definitely buy this repeatedly- worth every penny to us!!"
5,"Really good truffle flavor. Used some in scrambled eggs this morning. And,  just ate a dinner of angel hair pasta, truffle oil, and grated asiago cheese.......heaven. At this rate, I will be ordering this again next week!"
5,This is the best truffle oil out there. They infuse good olive oil. Beware of those who use cheap oils instead! I keep buying this. The seller ships quickly and packs well. You can trust this delicious product!
5,I purchased these for my wedding favors and they were a huge hit! The candied almonds were not too sweet and the mint green color is gorgeous. It was a whole lot cheaper to buy these on Amazon.
5,We needed more of these for wedding favors. This was one of the best prices and we got them quick. Product was good. Thank you
4,"I'm stuck on this. Cans are better, more lemon taste but them the price is sky high on the 22oz cans I switch to this."
5,My husband loves this drink so we keep a pitcher of it in the fridge year 'round. It's nice to be able to buy the 24 quart size. We mix it a little light; 3 scoops (3/4 cup total) per 2 quarts of water.
5,"On our summer vacation, I made sure to big 2 pounds of Weavers Organic Coffee with us. Because we not only can't live w/out this excellent quality coffee, but are always disappointed when we buy others at coffee stores. Vacation was a lot better w/ Weavers on us!!"
5,"Weaver's got it right with this one. Lot's of body,lots of depth. Very deep and rich in flavor and very earthy and rich in flavor yet very smooth. I particularly appreciated it's caramel finish. Truly a fine cup of coffee. One of the best."
5,"I drink coffee black and this coffee goes down smooth.<br /><br />Strong enough, yet not overpowering. Great caramel undertones. Works great anytime of the day.<br /><br />My stomach is happy with it and everything comes out alright. (No, seriously, that's a huge plus.)"
5,"Grind it right before you brew it and you will have the best cup of coffee possible, if you use a permanent filter with a drip coffee machine you get the full flavor, much like you would get from a french press. Bottom line its the best blend of coffee i have had on amazon."
5,I LOVE weaver's coffee!!!! This is one of the best gourmet's coffee's I have had. I would recommend this coffee to any coffee lover out there!
4,"We ordered this after having and enjoying 'the blend' for seemingly-forever.  In order to have a decent (our opinion) cup, we had to use 1.5 times the amount of coffee that we need when using 'the blend'."
4,I found this coffee to be fairly good but by no means outstanding. I did not detect any caramel finish. In my opinion it cost far more than its worth.
5,"I am a coffee fanatic and drink it for the taste, all natural from a french press. I have tried many different kinds here on Amazon and can say that Weavers full bodied is truly the best with flavor that is not too bitter and not sour, you do have to know how to make it right..."
5,This is no doubt a quality product. It smells perfect. It tastes perfect when brewed properly. I'm adding this coffee company to my subscribers list. You won't be disappointed.
5,"Tried this coffee while working an early morning job. It was one of the best coffees I have ever tried. The flavor is warm and strong, and I left me wanting more than just one cup. I go to Starbucks all the time, and I honestly thought this coffee was better :) definitely recommend!"
3,camerons organic velvet moon is way better. Comparing the two products this product isn't what it is hyped up to be.
5,"I agree with the majority of reviewers in stating that this is excellent coffee, very rich but not overwhelming in the caramel flavor.  I was not familiar with the brand prior to finding this on sale, but I know I'll be ordering it again."
5,I have tried many different coffees and have never experienced tasting such an excellent coffee like Weaver's organic blend whole bean coffee.  It is very full-bodied and sweet.  There is no bitter after taste.  I highly recommend this coffee to anyone who loves a great cup of coffee!
4,"An enjoyable cup of coffee. Tastes better, to me,through an aero press than a french press.Tasted better with some honey or sugar, although I usually use none."
5,This coffee is great!  I ordered it as a Christmas present with a new grinder and he went through a full bag of these beans in just a few short weeks and praised the quality repeatedly.  Will definitely be purchasing again.
5,"This is absolutely the best coffee in America. Anyone who makes the effort to try this coffee will be addicted. I'm a huge proponent of french press coffee, and this stuff is BY FAR the best that way. It's beyond belief in drip as well. Try it and you'll see what I mean"
5,"We have been trying different coffee through Amazon and by far, this is the best! It has a wonderful taste. Definitely, ordering this again."
5,My girlfriend can rarely have caffeine because of her heart but she can't help but always have a little cup when I make a pot of weavers organic blend. The French roast is worth a try but I must say my absolute favorite is the organic blend! its taste is unchallenged by others.
2,its not that this coffee sucks its that it doesn't begin to measure up to all the hoopla!<br />its well balanced but thats about it<br />& even a little old tasting nothing special in the least<br />what sweet caramel finish?<br />can't believe this is the same coffee the 5 star reviews are about
5,"Woooowwww ! The ORGANIC BLEND is probably the best thing I have ever tasted. When I opened the bag and the aroma filled the room, everyone just freaked out.<br />I would say The Organic Blend is the BEST !  And not just because NBC TODAY show said so..... ;)"
1,"It's not an amazing tea. It's an ""okay"" tea. I buy regular green tea at asia market for way cheaper price and I get same result. I look for saving money. Will not repurchase."
4,Great Product At a awesome price! I've been drinking this product from early May and the health benefit are great .
5,I am the aunt to 4 dogs and they visit me for sleepovers - I always try to have treats they like and this was no exception!  They kept coming back for more :-)
5,DOGS LOVE THEM.  They are the perfect treat to put in the kennel with them when I have to leave.
5,My large Corgi mix loves these. They are great as treats and/or crumbled and mixed in with his food. Found these to be much cheaper than at my local store.
5,Most dogs love these but our dog was less than pleased.  He is a tad persnickety.  It is a good product with few calories. Great for training purposes.
5,The Merrick Lamb Filet Squares are the best treat I have found for my dogs. All of my dogs love them. They are hard to find on the shelf as they are so popular they are often sold out at the stores.
1,This was gross. It lamb lund & smelled bad. There hard chips. My dogs Favorite is the Texas Taffy. Thats a winner. I cut it into peices. she LOVES THEM.
5,"A friend of mine recommended these chocolate nibs and I love them. They arrived promptly and undamaged. And most importantly, the price was great!<br />:)"
5,What can I say? If you love anise bears as much as I do then you understand why I buy several packages at a time. I recommend you do the same!
5,"I order a vast quantity of this sugar about twice a year.  We use it on everything. Actually, once you start using raw sugar, white sugar falls short in the taste department."
5,"I've always like Sugar-in-the-Raw but it is usually too expensive. Amazon has this priced very reasonably and I've been buying it regularly. I also try to avoid any food with hi-fructose corn syrup, and this sugar is what I like."
5,"This is one of the best combination of flavors! I keep thinking my family and I will get tired of having this on ... everything! Try it on every type of fish, salad, pot stickers, and any tofu dish. Enjoy! Great delivery service by the way!"
5,"I tried this special sauce on grilled salmon and grilled chicken. It is simply awesome, though not cheap, and I can't find anything better.  Yummy.<br /><br />RH<br />St. Louis, MO"
5,"This is an excellent addition to sweet wines, and champagne glasses ;)  Especially if you are a newbie wine drinker, trying to learn to love it... this seals the deal!  Sooooo good!!  Friends of mine that normally don't care for wine, also loved this!"
5,"These are the BEST Pumpkin Pie Bars ever!  Impossible to find in my area, so checked on Amazon & there they were!  We will have a VERY Happy Thanksgiving this year - this is our dessert!"
5,But I coulnd't get it delivered for Xmas - I was penalized because I didn't proscratinate.
3,"I loved the packs with the flavors, except the chocolate covered. They were horribly melted into one great big discolored glob. Figures, with temps over 100 in SoCal everyday during the summer. I can't blame anyone. It is what it is."
5,"These coffee beans are excellent! Got them within a week, great considering they ship from Costa Rica! They have the perfect chocolate to bean ratio!"
4,"This tea is a nice change from my regular black tea. I'm not big on the taste of herbal teas so this was a good choice. It's closer to black but has it's own special taste, which I found myself looking forward to. Great in the evening as it doesn't contain caffeine."
2,These are tasty enough for an emergency snack/lunch--I keep a few in my file cabinet. But our local Meijer's sells them for $1.33 apiece. Even the discount price here is twice that.
5,I love this stuff! I am currently deployed in Afghanistan and working extremely long hours.  I keep these delicious little kits in the office and in my wall locker in my sleeping area.  They have saved me many times when I couldn't leave to get a complete meal in the dining facility. Love them!
1,"We love Trader Joe's Just the Clusters Vanilla Almond Granola Cereal but were very disappointed with the quantity we recived for the price charged.  As a result, we returned same."
5,I have purchased many porcini mushrooms in grocery and gourmet stores. These were the best quality (flavor and shape). The price was excellent as well. I added some to a fresh mushroom soup I made and got an incredible depth of flavor. Have also used them in braised beef dishes.
5,"I have been buying mushrooms from JR Mushrooms for over a year now. I have ordered maybe 5 times. Service, delivery and quality are always number 1! I highly recommend this company and their products.<br />Trevor"
4,"Excellent rich flavor and the mushrooms were freshly dried.  Based on the spores under a microscope, were these 100 percent Boletus edulis?<br />Rick"
2,These were fair.  I don't feel they are AA quality.  Would not repurchase.
5,One of my most favorite things to eat is a soft pretzel. I enjoy going to the movies just so I can eat a soft pretzel! These soft pretzels are awesome! I will definitely order more in the future.
5,"There are no pretzels that compare!<br />I like putting salt on them and putting them in the toaster until crunchy on the outside and soft in the middle.  Sometimes I'll have them with mustard, but that isn't even needed because they taste so good!!!"
5,Purchased for lemonade diet and it was more than enough for me and my wife while on the cleanse for 25 days... excellent deal for the price paid
5,"It's the same spice that you buy in smaller quantities, so it's just as good for a much better price."
5,"This has got to be one of the Best holiday coffee's available. I am so hooked but now cannot locate it anywhere....If anyone has the chance to try this you will love it, so definatly buy it while you can."
5,I enjoy the flavor of this very delicious soft peach candy.  It has definitely become one of my all time favorite candies.  The other flavors that this seller makes are also good but the peach flavor ranks #1 in my book.
4,"I was looking for the old fashion in,heavy syrup Apricots,but this as close as I've found.I just add a quarter cup of sugar and cool or freeze it and enjoy. Yum!"
5,"These apricots are just great.  They are full of flavor but not too sweet.  There are about 8 to 9 halves to a can.<br /><br />There was a problem with some severely dented cans but as usual, Amazon made it right."
5,"If you are looking for a pick me up--these Apricot halves<br />by Libby's are so refreshing. The Apricots must have been picked and canned at exactly the right time. The texture is great, they are so tasty and they are not heavy on your tummy. They are one of my favorite items to snack on at night."
1,"This product is a waste of money!  It is bitter bitter and salty salty. Save your money and by the peaches instead.<a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0040PYN86"">Libby's Unpeeled Apricot Halves in Pear Juice From Concentrate, 15-Ounce Cans (Pack of 12)</a>"
5,this mustard is called brown but it is identical to what other company's label as black.  good quality delivered in small bags.
5,I can no longer buy this in my area so was thrilled to find it on Amazon.  It is one of my favorite breath mints which I keep in various places around my home as well as in both of my cars.
5,Very good gum - flavor doesn't last a long time but I still love it.  The peppermint is my favorite.

2,These were fair.  I don't feel they are AA quality.  Would not repurchase.
1,These are from China and nowhere as good as those from Italy. Spend the extra money and get those from Italy.
5,I am happy with my purchase. The mushrooms are mostly whole and have a quality shroomy smell to them (not old and dusty in other words).
5,"This cake mix can not be beat for making muffins. I have purchased this locally for years and the resturant supply who carried it discontinued it. I tried several different recipes and cake mixes, nothing compared to Ghiradelli! So glad I can still get it online ar Amazon. Wonderful stuff!"
1,Amazon pirated my personal image for their listing. It is not a stock image.  I created it and put my website name on it...LooneyStuff.com...for use on my website. I have asked them to take my image down from this listing.
5,"I love Jolt and can remember when I use to be able to get it at just about every gas station. But now its harder to find. So happy when I found it on amazon, and its still awesome as always! Can't wait until they get more in stock!"
5,"Great product, exactly as expected.  Actually arrived in plastic containers, not the bags as shown - a definite and appreciated upgrade."
4,The pretzels are really good butI think the box of pretzels could be packed alittle better or the carrier who delivers could be more careful. Many of the pretzel rods were broken in half  with some in small pieces.<br />The two plastic barrels wre partially crushed.
5,This is something I was looking for the office. They were affordable and great taste! They arrive on time too!
5,"My absolute favorite. Very cherry indeed. This is the only jelly bean I enjoy. Guess I will have to order more. Thay lasted no time with the grandkids, lol"
5,These are good. I made the hamburger/sauce up and froze it in three parts. I only use part at a time when I'm really hungry and too lazy to cook. They are good.
4,"Taco Bell scores on this one. The flour tortillas are not too thin and not too thick, just right. Makes it easy to put a meal on the table really fast."
5,"I purchased Bob's Red Mill 12 Grain Pancake/Waffle mix and gosh dernit a small waffle iron. I prefer a stronger maple syrup and this is a great buy from Anderson's. If you don't see any reviews in the next couple of weeks, it will be due to sticky maple syrup fingers and possible carb overload."
4,It is not Vermont Maple Syrup.  I am originally from upstate NY and grew up with<br />the Vermont Maple Syrup and I am used to it. This syrup lacks that little tang(for lack of a better word) that the Vermont Syrup has.  It does come in second tho.
5,"I had been buying Trader Joe's Grade B for about the same price.  TJ is kind of a drive so I used the prime and this is far superior.  Used Alton Brown's recipe for buttermilk pancakes from scratch, added blueberries and this syrup capped off a great breakfast."
5,I've had quite a few different Grade B maple syrups over the years and this brand is my favorite. Rich maple flavor and nice thick texture. Love this syrup on buckwheat waffles and pancakes. Highly Recommended!
5,There is nothing like real maple syrup.  Grade B is the highest quality syrup.  Will definately order this product again.  Price is good too for this quality.
5,We just tried the wonderful Maple syrup. We love it! Thanks to Andersons and hope they keep up the good work. Just ordered another one. Excellent.
5,I buy it over and again and keep it on hand because I have never had any maple syrup that is any better for the price. And even spending a lot more money has never delivered me any better product.
5,"Anderson's Pure Maple syrup is wonderful!!  So thick and oh so delicious.  The only problem is that I did the super savers deal and than they didn't have enough, kinda frusterating b/c I really do love this syrup."
5,"I am willing to buy every time I run out.<br /><br />Also, found it cheaper in a store; so won't purchase online anymore ."
5,I like the syrup.  What more can I say. I like it.. I like it. I like it. I like it.
3,"Tasty Syrup, but I was walking the aisle at my local superstore and found the exact same product for $3 less. And I don't live anywhere near vermont. Ah well - its still great stuff! And my pancakes thank me."
5,Delicious and the best price I could find! No more buying the syrup at stores for half the size and the same price.
5,"I tried ordering these from Amazon for the first time. I worried that getting 6 cans at once was a little over the top, but my family of three consumed them within two weeks.  These have a great flavor, and are a great snack. I will order them again and again..."
5,these are the best green olives on the planet. i buy cases of these. they are well over 4.50 at some stores. i get them here when they are avail.
3,"at $12 for 2.1 ounces, no wonder one can't pull up the bag to see details.<br />Like $80 per pound!"
5,"A recipe in Cooking Light recommended that Potato Starch be added to cupcakes, cakes, etc. when you reduce the amount of butter.  It worked well and I would recommend this company.  They had a fast ship and well packaged."
3,"I was thinking 1 lb would be a lot more than what it actually came out to be. Especially since starch is somewhat light, and since it was $8. I wish they sold this in larger quantities."
5,"Learning to cook Gluten Free is difficult.  I especially like bread and have been experimenting with this product to mix a flour that is like my mother's.  So far it is an experiment, but I couldn't do without it."
2,"They may have great products, but shipping is incredibly slow (shipped 12 days after I placed the order; not yet received) and the shipping price is unreasonable."
5,"We used to buy this pasta regularly at our local supermarkets, but a few years ago it just vanished...  We were very glad to stumble upon it on Amazon, and the transaction was, as usual, perfectly fine."
5,"Discovered this pasta years ago in Canada. Love it, but so hard to find consistently in US stores.<br /><br />This is the second time that I have bought from this seller. Excellent service from start to receipt."
5,"Great to send to my son, a college student.  Easy to fix and very tasty."
2,DONT BE FOOLED - This is not a Health Cereal.<br />The second ingredient is SUGAR and this cereal also has fructose in it.  I feel like I'm eating kid cereal.  It would be healthy if it had less sugar in it.  Carb-conscious people and diabetics BEWARE.
4,"Really tasty cereal, amazing packaging (way to go Amazon; the boxes were in better shape than at the store). Sometimes the cereal seems a bit too sweet. It's nice that I can get so much fiber from this, but one has to be careful not to eat too much haha."
5,"LOVE, LOVE, LOVE this cereal!  It tastes like a caramel version of cinnamon toast crunch.  All Fiber One products are great!  Not like other fiber products that taste like cardboard!  Get your daily fiber with a product that is actually delicious.  Highly recommend."
3,"I bought this -- just one box, not a six-pack -- on sale at a store. I can't believe how easy it is to get your fiber if you eat this cereal. Most cereals don't have even half this much fiber in them."
5,"I ENJOY A BRAKFAST CEREAL IN THE MORNING.THIS IS GREAT STUFF. WITH THIS I ADD LOW FAT VANILLA MILK, FRUIT AND NUTS. IT IS A DELICIOUS COMBINATION. ADDITIONALLY, IT IS HEALTHY IN KEEPING ME REGULAR."
4,"I really enjoy this cereal, it's really sweet so I mix it with the unsweetened fiber one original. And a great price!"
5,"I used to only like Fiber One honey cluster, but now I love it more. I like the texture. However, it is a little sweet for me, but don't get me wrong. It is just me and it is only 11g of sugar per serving."
4,"The product is great as a cereal or snack.  It's a very tasty and convenient way to get extra fiber in your diet. Problem occurred when only one 15.6 ounce box was shipped, but I was billed for the 4 pack.  Customer Service quickly addressed the issue, but I discontinued the ""auto ship""."
5,"This cereal packs a punch.  It has a tremendous amount of fiber yet tastes like a delicious ""regular"" cereal.  My 3 and 5 year old boys love it!"
3,"The best in fiber, as crunchy flakes.  Great as is or topped with fruit plus added skim milk or yogurt and you have a fresh start to your day!"
5,Even my children love this cereal... very similar to a cinnamon toast cereal that is out there.
5,"if you like caramel. and you also want a low-fat, filling, high fiber & tasty snack, this is perfect for you. i love these bars!"
5,"This is the best jelly I've ever had. You get rose petal from every small bite of the jelly, and it's not overwhelmingly sweet. Taste so rosy!"
5,This mustard was given to me by a client. This is truly the best Dijon mustard I have ever had!  I highly recommend it. I put it on literally everything. The other night my husband and I slathered it onto steaks. Delicious!
5,"We were pleased with this salt. It's actually more salty than regular salt, even kosher salt or sea salt.  A little bit goes a long way!  I don't usually cook with it, but add it to things afterwards. I've been hand grinding it."
5,"This is a great salt; it has a wholesome flavor and, I noticed it doesn't make you thirsty or rise the blood pressure as regular salt does. That's the benefit of the natural balance of minerals in it. I would recommend this to friends and health conscious people."
5,"This salt is so pink and taste like the ocean, I love it. Make sure to buy a grinder of some sort if you plan to use it on salads or sprinkle on cold dishes."
5,I love pink himalayan salt! It is loaded with minerals and taste great.  I don't have to use as much as the conventional table salt and I don't feel bad about using it because I know that it's also really good for my body.
5,"The product has far fewer pink crystals than shown in the picture, which is perfectly fine with me.  The salt is coarse, excellent for salt mills.  It tastes great and the size is what I wanted and haven't been able to find elsewhere.  The price and service is excellent, as well."
5,"I bought Himalayan Organic Salt twice. Each time, quality was really good and service was fast and courteous (The Spice Lab's). I will buy it again."
5,"I was very pleased with the Himalayan salt. It really does taste much better than ordinary salt and you can actually taste some of the other minerals in it. I would describe it like licking a salty rock, but in a good way. Very pleased and will be buying more."
5,"I have never ordered sea salt before. i thought this was great. I was afraid it would have some additional flavor that I wouldnt like. Instead it was fresh tasting & natural. I like the pink color, but glad it doesnt come out pink."
5,This salt has a slightly earthy taste. It is moderately coarse. I bought a ceramic grinder for when I would like to have it a little finer. I love this salt!
5,Great salt! Though now that I know how great it is I will have to buy a bigger bag next time. Mixed with some epsom salt and essential oils this makes a great bath salt. Ground up a bit finer it is wonderful for cooking. Will certainly buy again.
5,"I had been told that Himalayan salt was much better for you.  After shopping around, I found the best deal was through Amazon.  It came in a heavy resealable bag and works great in my salt mill.  I would buy this again and recommend it to my friends."
5,I use this salt very liberally now especially after finding out that its table salt you really need to avoid.  Our bodies need salt to live and this is the purest kind out there.  I plan to make this salt a part of my regular diet.
5,"I love this salt!!  The delivery was quick, the price was reasonable and the salt imparts a wonderful flavor to everything I eat!  And, it doesn't burn my tongue!  I will be using this salt for ever more!"
5,I absolutely love this salt.  The flavor is awesome and at a great price.  No more box salt for me.
5,I discovered this salt about 2 years ago and have not looked back. I love it. The Spice Lab gives you a high quality product for a great price. It is hard to describe Himalayan salt - you get more salty goodness without using so much. It is delicious!
5,"Great buy!  Fantastic taste and pleasing pink hue from the iron content.  I prefer a grinding salt, and this one is unprocessed for it's better for you."
5,"Can't tell it is any different than normal salt, except for a slight pink tinge. But if it has all the great minerals and stuff... all the better!"
5,"This salt is great and way cheaper than any of the local spice shops. It does seem more difficult to grind than other himilayan salts I have tried, but doing a little at a time makes it well worth it. Would i buy it again?? YES"
5,this is a fine example of mineral-rich himalayan salt. The packaging also keeps it fresh. It comes in a zip-seal pouch.
5,Fast service and item was exactly as described. Would purchase from this seller again. They even sent along more information on this salt and others as well as sent me some samples.
5,"This is my kids favorite of the salts at the moment.  I like it too, and will keep it in my collection. Great deal also, and great company to do business with."
5,"I got this for work, as I am a cook. Everyone noticed that I have had a change in the flavors of my food. They said it was a good change. Personally I have enjoyed useing the salt in different foods. I do like it very much."
5,"We grind our salt/pepper/spices fresh and this is out salt of choice.  It's milder than regular table salt, which allows for more precise control of how salty you want your foods."
4,i put it in a glass jar for chow watmore ken i talk about it is pink salt i resifet it fest
1,"Actually typed in ""smoked paprika"". This showed up so I ordered it and it is definatly NOT smoked!  Also, these bottles sell for 4.95 at Sam's. So, not only was it the wrong item but, I over paid also!"
5,This is regular Paprika you buy in the grocery store. Its good and a great price.
3,For a friend who loves jellies and turtles . He said they were soft and chewy just the ways he likes them and even though they were his favourite animal he couldn't stop eating em .
3,"Not much of a lemon flavor for lemon cookies, more on the sweet side.  Coconut is listed in the ingredients, but you certainly won't taste it.  My son liked them, so they won't go to waste.  I would not buy them again."
5,I love to have the vanilla mix 1 for breakfast or after s run...it took me forever to find a drink that was both lactose and soy free....my tummy LOVE'S. Mix 1!
5,So much better than other protein products in drugstores or even GNC. Taste great and doesn't fill up like other shakes do so you can work out after quickly. Relatively cheap for all the good things you get with it.
5,"Love this Coffee!  If you like a strong, dark, rich tasting cup of coffee this coffee is for you.  Another plus is that this coffee is easy on the stomach (not too acidic).  I will be coming back to Amazon for more."
1,"It's all cayenne and not authentic bebere. way too spicy, threw it out and made my own."
5,"I discovered this hot sauce while traveling around in Belize, it's on most tables in a lot of restaurants.  It has a lovely tang from the grapefruit, and is not tongue burning off hot, but a pleasing gentle heat.  I am never without!"
1,my finicky cats wouldn't eat this food so I gave it to my neighbor who rescues cats so the food wouldn't go to waste...
5,"I was searching for a source of pure vanilla, without any fillers, but without the hassle of the vanilla bean.<br />This ground vanilla is amazing. No fillers, easy to use, amazing taste and aroma.<br />I will be purchasing this again!"
3,"These seeds are on the edge of their sell by date. (11/11)  Not very good for the small scale gardener who wants to save some for next year.  Germination rates are at about 1/4.  Too early to tell much about the plants, but I will update again if they do well."
5,I come from a family of professional gardeners and I cannot grow plants to save my life. These seeds however did get started and actually grew a few inches...... however the rabbits in our garden thought the plants very tasty so clearly there is nothing wrong with the product ...it's the gardener!
5,"After Oberto cocktail pepperoni, no other will do.  It keeps well, and is a great low carb snack for the Atkins dieter.  I also like the large 32 ounce bag Amazon has available."
5,Ordered these for my diet. They are high in protein and only 140 calories per stick. They are great for a meal replacement as one stick will fill you up and keep you full for a long time. I have my stick during lunch at 11:30 with a glass of water and I am not hungry until dinner time at 5:30.
5,"You can't find these bad boys in Kentucky, so i usually have my mom ship me a bag every now and then. Thank goodness you can buy these online.... now I don't have to talk to my mom as much!!!"
5,"My kids enjoy The Cocktail Pepsticks  so iI buy them and send them to my kids<br /><br />Oh Boy! Oberto Cocktail Pepperoni (2.8-Pound) Sticks, 45-Count Bag"
5,"This cocktail pep is absolutely the best there is. I live somewhere that it is not sold in stores, so I am constantly buying different types of pepperoni to substitute for Oberto's Cocktail Pepperoni and none of the many that I have tried have even come close."
4,"My son is in MCC in Washington State, he received these items, and so far, no complains."
5,Delicious pepperoni!  Been buying Oberto since 1961.  Just wish we could find these large packages in the stores.
5,Vendor provided quick service and a fresh product packaged securely.  The O Boy Oberto Cocktail Pep tasted just the way I remembered.
5,"Oh boy, Oberto!!!!!!!!  Love those pepperoni sticks!!!!!<br />It is nice to get a BIG supply.  I just wish they lasted longer!"
5,"My dad introduced me to these things when I was kid. We used to eat them all the time on opening day of the trout season, or deer hunting up in the cascades. My brother always calls them ""heart attack in a bag"" even though he can't stop eating them. They really are that good!"
5,I've been eating these since the early 80s. They are my favorite brand of all time. It seems they are getting impossible to find even from Oh Boy Oberta. My package arrived today and they are as fresh as the day from the factory...meaning well preserved and soft. I hope I can find more.
4,"I really enjoyed the smoked sausages, it took me nearly 3 weeks to finish.  But I would definitely purchase this again.<br /><br /><a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0026WL13U"">Oh Boy! Oberto Cocktail Pep Smoked Sausage Sticks, 3.8-Pound Package</a>"
5,"So tasty they didn't last much longer than a week.<br /><br />I was hoping for the thicker pep logs, but these hit the spot.  I'll be ordering more until I can find a source for the larger ones outside of gas stations."
5,I have always liked Oberto sausage and these short bite sized links are very handy.
5,"I've never had any qualms with the Oberto brand and this is an excellent deal, especially as a gift subscription! $12 every two months and my dad has an essentially limitless supply of Oberto Cocktail Pepperoni. This stuff tastes so good too, I may have to steal some from him..."
5,O BOY Oberto  pep sticks and sausage sticks are the best I buy them when I get to Seattle
3,"This isn't the best tasting pepperoni, but it's acceptable, and you certainly get a lot of it for the money."
1,"I thought this was a great deal in the warehouse deals section, but it was pretty nasty and smelled like dog food when I opened each bag.  Slim Jim is made of crap too but at least it tastes good."
3,"This does NOT taste like peperoni. More like Slim Jim, except this uses real sausage casing (Slim Jim uses paper...shhh.)"
1,"When I first took a bite, I seriously thought I was eating dog food.  These are disgusting.  I searched the bag for ""dog food"" and the expiration date thinking that it was bad for one of those reasons.  I don't know how anyone can like these."
1,"this item molded 7 days after opening (stored in air tight container) I would give it -10 if I could, Tasted very much like cereal nothing like pepperoni"
1,"this item molded 7 days after opening (stored in air tight container) I would give it -10 if I could, Tasted very much like cereal nothing like pepperoni"
1,"They taste more like chemicals than meat.  I like a lot of jerky and meat sticks, but would not eat these.  The dogs liked them though."
1,"Oh Boy! Oberto Cocktail Pep Smoked Sausage Sticks, 32-Ounce Bag (Purchased on 02/19/2009)<br /><br />This was the worst product I have ever tasted. I have had many Oberto products, and this was nothing like what I've eaten before. Even my dog wouldn't eat them, they were so nasty tasting."
1,These quickly became dog treats!  Just nasty!  I don't even know how they can sell these for human comsumption!  Stay away!
1,"Only good use for these would be: In case of poisoning, use to induce vomiting!"
5,Excellent service!  Excellent Price!  Excellent Product!  I can't keep the dog off the phone telling her friends how much she is enjoying her Best Buddy Treats!  I have a very happy dog!
5,My dog loves the treats!!! I have a yorkie and they are just the right size for him. I let a friend give her dog some and they loved them also.
5,"The pistachios are large, fresh, and delicious!  This cute bag makes a perfect hostess gift, and a nice holiday gift for casual friends."
5,I've been using this ghee for years now and can say that it's hands down the best.  The quality is unsurpassed.  I've spoken with the owner of the company (a really nice man) who told me his wife hand packs the jars!  This is truly a family business and one that I feel happy supporting.
5,I ordered this after finding out that it's not good to cook with olive oil. This was my first time trying ghee and I really like it. When I ran out I bought another brand of ghee from the story but I definitely like this one better. I just wish they had a bigger size.
5,"Wonderful flavor full of easily assimilated vitamins and minerals. My son is allergic to dairy except for ghee. He does well with This product because it is both organic and grass fed. I wish I could buy it locally to cut down on packaging, though."
4,"This is an excellent product.  I wish it were less expensive and came in larger containers, however.  I really like the fact that it is organic and comes from grass-fed cows, which, I believe produces a healthier product!"
5,"Great to make popcorn with! I even put some on a sweet potato, I cannot get raw butter, so I use this as a substitute."
5,"Delightful flavor. Fantastic for stir fried vegies. Only coconut oil cooks this well, but it doesn't add that great flavor. If you eat primal, this is great! You can't find this at the grocery."
5,"This is a great product!  It tastes really good, and I love that it's grass-fed.  I will definitely buy this again."
5,"This stuff is awesome!  Tastes better than butter with a nice smoky finish.  Great on veggies, as a spread, or to use in cooking. HIghly recommend"
5,"I love that this ghee is organic and grass-fed. I also love that it's rich and delicious, has a great shelf life (not that it lasts long in my house), and is easy to use. I'm off to melt a few spoonfuls onto some popcorn now!"
5,This ghee has a richness and depth of flavor that I have found in no other ghee. It is so very yummy that I don't even consider buying cheaper brands. I value that it's from grass fed cows too. Great product!
5,"This is the first ghee I have ever used for cooking and it tastes really pure.  It's the only one on Amazon (as far as I know) thats USDA organic, hence higher price.  I am going to try and different one now to see how this one compares with one that isn't organic."
4,"Love the smell of the ghee, just reminded me of the authentic ghee we used to get back in India. The fact that the ghee is made of grass-fed cows is for me a huge relief. I am so glad I found this treasure. Hope they reduce the price a little so that I can buy more with out guilt."
5,"This is the first time I buy ghee,the service was really fast.  Would buy this brand again, great taste, texture, won't change brand."
5,"I hardly use butter after trying this stuff.  I use it for cooking and in my morning ""bulletproof"" coffee.  Great flavor, great company for offering an organic grass-fed product, and great service from Amazon.  I would highly recommend this to anyone that's interested."
5,"Grass Fed Ghee by Pure Indian Foods is the best Ghee on the market, in my opinion. It tastes better than the rest, and is wonderful to cook with because of it's high heat capability without burning. Tastes like the butter it is made from, without the heavy milk solids."
5,"like my title says, this is the best ghee on the market... it's fantastic! grass fed, organic, what more could you ask for? oh, right... it's delicious!!"
5,"This is a good quality ghee. I've tried another brand and it had an odd aftertaste, but not this one. This one is good enough to eat with a spoon if you wanted to. mmmmmmmm"
5,This ghee is delicious. A little goes a long way because of the intensity of flavor. It imparts wonderful aroma to vegetable dishes and does not burn easily like butter. highly recommended.
4,"<span class=""tiny""> Length:: 1:04 Mins<br /><br /></span>Additionally:<br />Doesn't state ""100% grass fed"" but I'm not so sure such a products exists? This product is certainly the best alternative!"
5,This is an excellent product. The taste is delicious and it is great for sauteing since it has a high smoke point. I also love that it is grass-fed! I will definitely recommend this to my health-conscious friends.
5,"<span class=""tiny""> Length:: 0:41 Mins<br /><br /></span>Brief review of Pure Indian Foods Ghee.  Great lactose free alternative to butter."
5,"<span class=""tiny""> Length:: 0:52 Mins<br /><br /></span>Here's my video review of Pure Indian Foods ghee. It's delicious, and I bet you'll love it! Making ghee can be tough, so having premade ghee is key in a healthy lifestyle."
4,"I recieved this Ghee right away and came safely packaged. I love that it is grass-fed and organic, very important to my family. We use this with stir fry and saut&eacute;ing and can't wait to try on our popcorn! Delicious Ghee!"
5,I ordered this ghee for my family while we work at improving our dental health and overall health.  It's very tasty and the kids love it on toast.  It also came REALLY fast which was nice.  I will be ordering more.
2,"Very expensive and not worth the price. Try PurityFarm Organic Ghee, it's much cheaper and taste much better than this Ghee. Don't waste your money."
5,The first time I tried Moonstruck Chocolates I was hooked. These are the very best chocolate truffles !  I ordered the truffle box and it arrived quickly . Everyone should try a Moonstruck chocolate. It is really a treat !
5,"Nothing is better then a gluten free pretzel that taste like a pretzel! This is one of the few that are out there that actually taste like a pretzel, and if you are like me that matters."
5,The popcorn was great!! Everyone commented on how good it was and how it really tasted like movie theatre popcorn. I received it quickly and intact.
5,Orville's is the best microwave popcorn you can buy...in my opinion.  The price is outstanding from Amazon and we have compared it all around at various stores.  Almost all the kernels pop and we love the movietheatre butter flavor!<br />Cannot go wrong with this purchase.
5,"This is delicious popcorn.  It's buttery without being too butter heavy.  Very little ""old maids""  :-).  Very light and easy to eat."
5,"I've tried several different brands of microwave popcorn and I think this is the best, by far.  Great flavor, very few seeds after popping and not greasy."
3,"I love Orville Redenbacher and so I ordered a case. Unfortunately, It looks old and the bags are weeping butter. The popcorn tastes OK when it does fully pop, if you can get pass that...what am I saying? Buy the 3 pack and try it out first."
5,"This is by far the best oatmeal I have EVER put in my mouth. Lots of texture and most importantly delicious. My fav is usually just McCains Irish Oats, this far exceeds that. You wont be disappointed with this if you love oatmeal!"
5,Use as a rub or mix in with canned salmon and mayo for a fast tasty dip.  Great stuff.
5,"All 3 of my cats including the skittish/picky kitten adore these treats! My high-anxiety kitten hides all of the time and won't eat these same treats in the Milk flavor, but she always comes out and eats these Seafood treats! Couldn't be happier!"
5,All our kitties love these treats. They come running at treat time. It's their favorite treat. Seafood is a favorite flavor.
5,"Good price, free delivery, automatic replenishment, cats love it (it's the only reason they come in) - a fine deal! (I'm a little worried, though that they'll get tire of this flavor - maybe another option with mixed flavors?)"
1,The product came at the end of August with expiration date of 01/07. As a result I could not eat it. Just waist of money
5,"This is pure decadence sophisticated delight - i had no problems with the delivery either. One have to be into marzipan ,if you dont know  or tasted marzipan before , try it first on inexpensive kind . This is the ultimate for me ."
5,Add 1/4 cup to 2 cups of raw peanuts in a food processor and make homemade peanut butter. Grind till smooth.  (Add 1/4 cup sugar and a tsp of salt if you prefer)
4,"Very beautiful and added a wonderful appearance to some of our Christmas Cookies.  Tasted good as well, with no bitter or chemical flavor.  A good alternative to all the frosting that is popular these days on cookies."
5,I can't find dragees cheaper anywhere else. These are the exactly the same you would buy at a craft store for allot more.
2,"Why in the world would Amazon want to sell an item and say can be ingested,  when it clearly has ingredients that can cause cancer. Wish every state would wake up like California and ban all these cancer causing things."
1,There is a warning for this package that it has things in it that cause cancel!!!  Why would you put cancer in your food?
5,Great dry cat food. Will definitely buy it again for my cat. He loved it and never got tired of it.
5,My cats love this cat food. I am very pleased with all the varities. It is very healthy much more than the artificially colored store brands that made one of my cats throw up when he ate it. Their coats have become very shiney. Very impressice cat food. Highly recommend
1,"I bought a couple of flavors from Halo's, both were not a hit with my cats unfortunately. My cats would not touch it."
4,"I used to chew this gum all of the time! My G-ma had over 250 packets of it in her basement! It tastes so good! When I was young, I'd eat 1 little Chicklet at a time! The flavor doesn't last that long, but it tastes amazing when it does!"
5,"Loved them. Product shipped super fast really a throw back treat, the flavor does not last long but they are addicting!"
5,the grand children love them.  It's a great way to keep them entertained and behaved cuz they know they will get a treat from grandma.
5,This tiny Chiclets are very addicting. Since I use the subscribe and save I never seem to run out. I love grabbing a pack and eating the whole thing at once. Yummy.
2,"It taste okay, but they are  not soft and the taste doesn't stay very long. I wouldn't buy them again."
5,I was raised in the East having this syrup on pancakes and just plain bread. Still the beat around! I only wish I could get it in AZ. The shipping is more than the syrup!
5,"My mother-in-law always makes Pennsylvania Dutch Fasnachts (doughnuts) every year during Lent.  King Syrup is the perfect, and required, accompaniment! I'm California born and raised, but love King Syrup -- and Fasnachts!"
5,I was raised up with King Syrup.  I couldn't find it until last year. My Brother lives inCalifornia and he couldn't find it eaither so I mailed him some for xmas this past Christmas. He loves it as well as my other 4 siblings.  Thank You so very much for abilling me to get some more.
5,"I grew up on King Syrup in Virginia. Its still the best and still sold in stores in PA. and VA. I have mine and it was great on biscuits, been a along time since I had Syrup and biscuits with Good ol' King Syrup. When I was a kid I called it Lion Syrup,, lol"
5,For those of us on the West Coast Carl's Jr serves King Syrup in their syrup packets for French Toast.
5,"I also grew up on the east coast (USA), where this was, and may still be, readily available. We ate it on pancakes, ice cream, pumpkin pie..... Mom also used it in baking. None other matches the thick richness of this syrup, or the taste! Whenever I've gone back east, I've stocked up!"
1,"First of all, the tea is gross. It tastes nothing like bubble milk tea. secondly, the seller must know this product is less than expected because they sell it in incriments of two (2.2lb) bags. NOW IM STUCK WITH TWO BAGS (4.4LBS) of this junk. I want my 30 bucks back."
5,But VERY delicious just the same. If you're looking for a wee bit of a different flavor in the old favorite Oreo -- this is just what you're looking for! LOVE the size of the mini's too.
5,Very good and quick service. My plant arrived just in two days in very good shape and is doing well.
4,"When i got it, was in amazing condition, only problem is it died due to the fact bugs { nats & flies } Love this for some odd reason. But all n all, love the plant! Will buy from seller again."
5,"While 12 packages were to be sent out in 1 order ONLY 1 pack was sent out in 1 order BUT after contacting you and explaining the problem your company fixed it right away - AFTER ALL we all make mistakes, thanks for your handling the situation so quickly."
3,"Is this price correct?  $46.34 works out at over $7 a lb!  I am sorry, but for this price I would not buy from this supplier.  This is just a ridiculous price.  Walnuts can be purchased ANYWHERE for less than $5. per lb."
5,"I love these chopped walnuts.  I put them in cereal, chicken salad and sweet potato casserole, to name a few.  They are good for you, also."
5,"These chopped walnuts are just perfect for baking.  They save a lot of prep time.  My local super market is always out of stock, and they cost more there than they do from this seller.  They were delivered in only two days!  Very satisfied!"
5,"But Fuzzy prefers the salmon primavera to the yellowfin tuna. However, Toto (aka Totolicious) loves it. I have to keep writing until I reach 20"
2,Product is good; my cats like it.  But the price just keeps climbing.  I will have to train my cats to eat cheaper cat food.
4,This is a good product.  The price at Amazon is excellent and I really like it just coming to my door.  Subscribe and save is an excellent way to shop
5,I should bite the bullet and only order this more expensive Fancy Feast for my 3 cats. They all love it; it's the sauce. There isn't any waste. Setting up autoship assures me that I am getting the best possible price around.
5,"This is one of the few cat foods my fussy cat will eat.  He loves the gravy especially.  Wish they would sell that on it's own!  And amazon's subscribe and save is the best price I can find, and so convenient too!"
5,"As much as one can tell with cats, mine seem to prefer this as their favorite."
4,"works well as a rub on chicken<br /><br />also adds plenty of flavor when mixed in to meatloaf<br /><br />has some smoke, not too much fire"
5,I use this product whan I make Honey Jalapeno ribs. Gives a nice mild smoke flavor. Great price on this also.
4,If you love chiles then ancho powder is a must have for any blends you may create. I recommend with chipotle powder. Try different peppers in different amounts for amazing results.
5,"I've seen a lot of popular chefs use this in recipes but could never find it in the stores. This goes great in marinades, rubs, wings, spreads, etc. A great addition to any spice/seasoning collection!"
5,Exactly as advertised. Plenty of space to set the Keurig brewer on top and still fit under a counter top (depending on counter top height). Cups fir in nicely and the drawer is easy to access and see what K-Cups you may want.
1,Cost was $48 at time of review.  Only $25 at other sites .... buy elsewhere!  Sometimes prime is worth paying an extra dollar or two. I will be comparison shopping a little more now.
2,"This sells for $29.99 at Bed, Bath and Beyond. Add your 20% off coupon and you're good to go ...<br /><br />I also had cabinet issues and returned it to BB&B."
5,The drawer fit perfectly and is a real space saver!  It is just the right size and holds all our coffee choices.
4,This is an extremely useful product. The only reason it gets 4 out of 5 is I should have looked closer on the dimensions and the width of my cabinets....
4,"<span class=""tiny""> Length:: 0:51 Mins<br /><br /></span>under-cabinet clearance when Keurig<a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B004L2NVVS"">Keurig Coffee Pod Drawer Holder 36 K-cup Capacity By My Perfect Kitchen</a> is sitting on top of pod drawer"
2,"Terrible clunky product.. drawer doesn't open/close without making clunky noises.  Not a space saver, hard on the eyes.  Would return it for a refund if I weren't terribly lazy.  Go to Bed Bath and Beyond and use a 20% off coupon for something else.  Not worth it."
1,"I have one of these and love it but I would never pay this much for it.  Got it a Bed, Bath, & Beyond for $24.99 and that was not a sale, just their regular price."
5,"I have this drawer and the carousel, I find it easier and less cluttered to use the drawer. I also have my Keurig on top of it with lots of room around it for misc items."
5,"This item is great. I dont have a lot of counter space in my kitchen or space in my draws to store my k-cups, so this item was perfect for me. It sits right below my keurig. I would highly recommend this item. A Great Buy and An Awesome Space Saver!"
5,Plain and simple. All you have to do is buy this drawer and set your coffee maker on top of it AND you are done. Easy to get your k-cups whenever brewing coffee. Right at your fingertips.
5,"GREAT WAY TO STOCK YOUR K-CUP ASSORTMENT WITHOUT HAVING TO TAKE UP EXTRA COUNTERSPACE W/ANOTHER ITEM SUCH AS THE CAROUSEL OR TOWER UNITS OFFERED, IF YOUR KITCHEN IS SMALL."
5,This is a great product....HOWEVER it is only about 25.00 at Bed Bath and Beyond and if you look in the Sunday paper always a 20% off coupon.
5,"The Keurig storage drawer is a perfect match for the coffee maker, the coffee machine sits perfectly on the top and makes getting the refills soooo easy.<br />I looked at other storage options but I found this to be Ideal. Really glad I bought it."
5,"I was ready to buy one of the carousel type k-cup storage devices when I saw this one.<br />It is a bit exepnsive, but it preserves counter space and keeps the k-cups right there.<br />I also use it to store the EZ cup reusable system."
5,I love this drawer. My Keurig Cuisinart Coffeemaker fits on it perfectly. It holds 36 K-cups so I always have many options for hot beverages right where I need them. I think it looks great and the drawer slides in and out very easily. Don't know how they could have made this simple item any better.
5,"Storage drawer is very handy to keep under the Keurig, instead of having sevaral boxes of K-cups. It is sturdy, however one of the adhesive foot pads came off (just stuck it back on) from moving the whole thing back and forth to open the pod lid wide enough."
1,Drawer is much larger than it appears in photo and takes up much more space on the cabinet surface. The drawer is sticky and not easily opened or closed. I would not purchase again.
5,Bought this as a gift for my mom because she loved mine. It arrived very quickly and was just what she wanted. Thanks!!
4,"The slots wernt exactly evenly spaced and its a bit stiff to pull out/push in. But bottom line it works! And looks good! For the price, can't beat it."
5,The Keurig fits nicely on top of the drawer.  The drawer opens and closes with ease. It organizes your K-cups and saves counter shape.
5,"My daughter has and enjoys this storage drawer.  Based on her recommendation, I ordered it and am very glad I did.  It looks nice, holds a lot of cups, and is very convenient.  Highly recommend."
4,"I Decided to fasten it under our cabinet to save more space. It is very sturdy, well made, and works great,"
5,"Love this!  It saves space and looks great.  I had to move the brewer out a litle bit from under my cabinets to be able to open the top, but otherwise no problem.  There's even enough room on top of the drawer to put my sweetener in a small holder."
5,My order arrived quickly and was packaged well and well worth the price. I like it better than the stand up K-cup holder because this goes right under the coffee maker and doesn't take up extra space. The drawer slides in and out smoothly too.
3,"I don't know if I have bad one (doubt it), but it doesn't slide well unless you lift up on it.  It's like the tracks are too tight, and if you try pulling straight out, it hangs, and then the cups inside go flying when it finally does slide because you end up jerking it."
4,I bought this for my office. It was perfect because it fits just right on the mini fridge with room for my mugs on the side. We love it because you can now see what to pick from when before we were going through boxes of k-cups.
5,"This drawer is very sturdy (as long as it's on a flat surface) and holds plenty of K cups. It's great because it doesn't use your counter space and even with my heavy CuisinArt K cup coffee maker on top, it still slides in and out very easily. Love it!"
5,The product arrived quickly.  It was just perfect and although it says it holds 36 K-cups - it actually holds MORE if you turn every other one upside down!  We have our coffee maker sitting on top and just love the convenience of the coffee right there. THANKS for a great product.
5,I received the Keurig K-Cup shelf and it is a perfect addition to the Keurig coffee maker and allows you to have 40 or so K-cups nearby without having to look at them (like you would have with the K-Cup tree).
5,"Sturdy. well made. convenient. Fits well under the Keurig machine and does not take extra space, Easy pull out drawer to view coffee choices"
2,Ordered 2 both had bent tracks and I actually cut my finger on one of the wires sticking out. But you get what you pay for....
5,This is very sturdy and not as some reviews were that stated this was flimsy.<br />I have no issues with it at all and would highly recommend it to anyone of my friends.
2,"Looks good, but does not open and close smoothly.  The drawer has medal feet that fit into a groove in the bottom of the unit as a track.  The tray sticks a lot and you have to hold the top of the unit to jerk the drawer out."
5,My order was processed quickly and arrived on time. Slide it out of the box and set it in place. Now everything is at my finger tips.
5,Good solid product.  Saves room when storing your k cups.  One thing to check is the space under your cabinet.  My Keurig is on my kitchen counter and I had to pull it out from under the cabinet since the tray would not open with the extra height.
5,"This item works  out great!!!Keeps everycup of coffee at your fingertips, and definitely looks good sitting on my unclutterd counter.!!  Quick ship...AAAA+++++"
5,Great storage for coffee and space saver.  May purchase another to stack them as we have enough space under cabinet.
5,"This is an attractive way to store all those k-cups, and they are right under the machine, never lost or mixed up.  The shelf pretty much matches any decor and the drawer does not rub or stick.  I love it."
5,"This product is well worth the money.  Others carry a similar product that's cheaper, but the quality is way cheaper also."
4,Nice storage drawer..matches nicely in my kitchen...only drawback is I can't store it under the coffee maker due to not be able to open the keurig dispenser so I store it under my toaster.  Other than that it's really nice.
5,I bought this one until I saw one exactly like it at a big box store (think red bullseye) for 24.99. This is going back!
2,I've been looking at this holder since I saw it at the at my office. Today I found it at BB&B for $24. It works great but too expensive at Amozon.
5,"If you like gadget, this is one more to add to your collection.<br />It works and fits nicely on a counter top.  You can then<br />put the machine on top of this drawer, saving space.<br />It glides smoothly."
4,"Coffee maker nicely stacks on top of drawer saving counter space.<br />I bought two since I keep a wide variety of K-cups.<br />However, I purchased mine at Bed, Bath and Beyond for about half the price."
5,I was not particularly happy with the storage drawer as it is made of wire and the cups don't sit in it flat.
4,Works well with my Keurig Cofee Maker. Always have K-cups handy. Uses less space than the other types of holders. glad I ordered this item.
5,I use my storage drawer for my assorted k- cups and my Keurig sits ATP the storage drawer. It has an easy clean top and is attractive and practical.
5,We love this tray. It is very sturdy and holds just enough K cups. I would recommend this to everyone
4,"I purchased this storage drawer so that I could better organize my mass of K-Cups. It currently sits underneath my Keurig. It looks very nice and does what it is supposed to. It is a simple design and while it doesn't save a lot of room, it doesn't take up much room either."
5,Tray fits perfectly under the coffee maker.  Color compliments color of coffee maker.  Non-skid top keeps coffee maker in place. Drawer is ventilated.  Ample storage space.  Love it.
5,"I love products that reduce clutter, are functional, and don't hurt your eyes to look at. I really like this drawer. I have it beneath my Cuisinart Keurig K-Cup Mini Brewing System. It's sturdy enough to hold the coffee maker. This is a product I would highly recommend!!"
5,A wonderfully ingenious way to keep all your K-cups in one place without taking up extra counter space! Keeps several different types of my favorite coffee.  I love it!
5,"looked all over for this. great space saver.  keeps the pods neat. water proof top is great for me, keeps me from soaking the kcups"
5,"This is so nice to have when space is limited.  Because of the height of our cabinets we were not able to place this under the machine, but have it on the side with our other coffee making supplies on top.  It stores plenty of Kcups for easy use. Much better for us than a stand."
5,This is my second purchase.  I have so many varieties of tea and coffee that one was not enough space.  They stack nicely next to my Keurig.
5,"Not only does this store all those annoying little Kcups, but I put sugar packs and creamers it it too.  The black top is great because it doesn't show every little splash of coffee. A much better solution that the tree-type stands!"
5,This storage drawer fits in perfectly on our countertop. We can either set the Keurig on top of it or beside it and still store a large amount of k-cups where people can get at them easily. Totally satisfied!
5,This is a great idea and a well made product.  It just seems to me that it was a no brainer to slide the whole thing out from under the cupboard.  This item is a great space saver.
5,"K-cup storage drawer is great.  I have the carousel, but wanted additional K cup storage.  The drawer fits the bill, and takes up no additional space since it sits underneath the Keurig Brewer.  No more K Cup boxes to hide somewhere."
4,Good storage of the K-Cups as well as enough storage so that it can support my Keurig coffee maker.  It easily solved the problem of how to store all my K-Cups much better than the rotating tower.
5,"We're neat people and keep our counter clear so this works great for us. It is well made, slides easily, and loads in a minute... also cups don't catch sunlight like the vertical racks would in our bright kitchen."
4,No obvious taste! So perfect for decorating cakes!!<br /><br />Highly recommend you check your local Michaels or Joann's. Amazon usually has competitive prices but these are $3-4 at your local craft store - $8 is WAYY overprice on amazon.com.
5,"While it may not look like much initially, I am very satisfied with the amount of shine the silver dust gives with mixed with some vodka and applied on pastillage. Made quite a difference for the look of a birthday cake i'm making. Item arrived in a timely manner and is well-packed."
5,"The silver pearl dust is reasonably easy to use, please use a light and careful touch. I used this to decorate spritz cookies, I used the tree mold, and the cookies were lovely and tasty!"
5,"I wish I had found this product sooner.<br />So far have only used it on my homemade chocolate truffles, and it does add a beautiful, almost mysterious bronze luster to them.  Almost hard to believe that it really IS edible.<br />Very happy with it and would definitely recommend."
3,When I added this to the cake it was so beautiful that I couldn't believe it! Even the customer was impressed! It made the cake look more professional for someone who's still learning to make beautiful cakes.
5,"San Marcos is by far the best brand of chipotle in adobo. Take that wonderful, smokey flavor and add it to refried beans and it's a no-brainer. These are a great medium hot bean."
3,The cookies at first taste good but it follows up with an interesting after taste.  It is also a little dry had to down a whole glass of milk but overall it wasn't too bad.
4,"Erin Baker's Breakfast Cookies are the greatest!! I ordered Morning Glory as one of the flavors last time, and they are very good. My favorite is the Banana Walnut , and I rate them as excellent."
1,"There are WAY too many flavors going on in this breakfast cookie...at least for my tastebuds.  Whomever was in charge of adding spices really went too far -- to the point that it is actually nauseating.  Obviously, I won't be ordering this one again."
5,I eat these cookies frequently using the subscribe method.  The nutrition provided is high quality.<br />I recommend all the Erin cookies for a snack or meal.
3,It is just okay to me. This product's flavor does not impress me as much as the vegan choc chunk ones offered by Erin.
5,"This is another great Breakfasr Cookie from Erin, would definately buy again. Great to carry when you must skip a meal."
2,"Honestly, with the amount of sugar in these, they are not much better than eating a 300 calorie regular cookie. I don't think these are that ""healthy."" The cookies taste fine, but I won't repurchase."
5,This is one badass cookie. I got these on sale at Amazon Warehouse..good deal. Otherwise it's a good expensive cookie..what else can I say? Grab some!
5,The breakfast cookie is excellent. My grandson came back from a scouting trip and said it was better than the energy bars they were given to eat. Nice blend for any time of day. I pop mine from the freezer into the microwave for about 20-30 seconds. Taste  best warm.
5,This made an excellent Mother's Day gift.  My mom with discriminating taste is truly enjoying them.  They have just the right amount of small-sweetness for breakfast and a flavor she likes.  The packaging makes them good for a mail order gift.
3,"I love Erin's Breakfast Cookies, but this flavor is a little to rich for me.  It gives me that funny feeling in the back of my throat."
4,These cookies are tasty but just a little too gooey and the calorie count is 300 for one cookie--this is a bit high!
4,"These aren't grandma's cookies, but tasty enough when eating healthy is what you try to do."
5,"Another great product!  Delicious and nutritious, it makes you feel guilty that you are eating something that is actually good and good for you!"
5,"Very good flavor and texture. Excellent wholesome snack. One of the best all natural oatmeal cookies I've ever tried. Plus, all natural ingredients."
4,"I especially like the chocolate cookie, but failed to freeze my cookies.  On the third day I had three molded cookies.  Word of advice -- put in the freezer within the first day or two."
5,"Breakfast is often a hard meal to fit in, and this is a great way to get the fuel that you need in this important meal.  Tasty (even better after 20 seconds in a microwave).  We're about to reorder - these are a hit!"
5,Gave Erin Baker's Breakfast Morning Glory Cookies as a gift and the recipient gave the cookies very high reviews! Thank you!
5,"I love this breakfast cookie! I usually have this with fruit and tea or juice for a quick breakfast, or sometimes I have it with vanilla ice cream for dessert."
5,I love these cookies!  They are just perfect for an 'on the go' breakfast bite paired with a piece of fruit.
5,"These cookies have good taste, ar a great quick breakfast, and are healthy.  I'll have one with a cup of coffee and I'm good for the morning."
1,The cookies tasted too much like baby food prunes to be any good.  Also they included directions to freeze them when they arrived to keep them from spoiling.  I would never buy these again.
1,Not Kosher!!! Ignore the Symbol!!! They are NOT Kosher and NOT certified by any company!!! I contacted the company to confirm.
2,The breakfast cookie is not to my liking and I do not think I will order them in the future!
2,"I was disappointed by my first taste of Kopali Organics Chocolate Covered Dried Banana. The chocolate is waxy and the bananas too soft for me. I was expecting more crunch, a drier banana. The banana did not taste of banana to me either. I will not purchase again."
2,"It clearly states on the description, pack of 6!  But I only got 5!  And I cannot find how to complain about this.  I don't want to return."
5,I don't buy my walnuts anywhere else. These taste great and are a fantastic price. I put most of them in the freezer and pull them out as I need them in order to ensure they stay fresh since 4 tubs lasts me quite a while.
5,"I GET THESE NUTS FOR MY CHURCH SISTER WHO DOES NOT HAVE  A COMPUTER. SHE ACTUALLY EATS THEM EVERY DAY, WHICH IS INCLUDED IN HER DIET."
2,Sesmark makes a very high quality rice cracker and then proceeds to ruin it by loading it up with so much salt as to make it inedible.  USE CAUTION before buying this item since there are NO RETURNS and you might find yourself with a throw away.
5,My entire family loves these crackers.  Great with cheese.  Delicious alone too.
5,"These crackers are great, too! Again, especialy for people who can't tolerate wheat! Others like them, too!  They stay crunchy.  You save money buying by the case."
5,These crackers are very addictive! The flavor is superb and the crunch is great.
5,"If you are gluten-free and want crackers, this is the one for you.  It is also delicious.  This is my second order of these."
4,"And that's part of the problem. No, really, I can eat just a few, maybe more later.<br />These thins are not quite as thin as I'd prefer (nor am I), but make a good snack. For hors d'oeuvres, if you top them with anything moist, do a few at a time; they get soggy pretty fast."
5,"These are great! Seriously. They kind of remind me of corn nuts. They are crunchy, light, a tiny bit salty and totally tasty. I just got them today and can't stop eating them. I very much suggest getting these. Pretty good price and so much better than the rice crackers at my local store."
5,"Sesame Rice Thins are the BEST tasting rice crackers I have tried - and I've tried several.  They stay crispy and crunchy and come in several flavors.  You won't be disappointed.  Amazon has the best price, too!"
5,These are my favorite gluten-free crackers and they come in many flavors.  I have tried and liked most of them.
5,Crispy with the light flavor of rice and sesame.  Lightly salted.  I love these crackers.
5,"As good as any in grocery stores and more reasonably priced.  But, you do have to get a carton of them."
5,I have to eat a gluten free diet and these crackers are the best I have come across.  I eat them with cheese or hummus.  Very good!!
5,"There is no other brand is comparable to this brand.  Whoever I gave the crackers to, would become addicted.  I keep order them over and over again."
1,"I ordered 2 cases as always. Rvc'd the 2 cases and the crackers were saltless, tastless. Amazon was kind to send 2 more cases and they were the same. BLAH!  I have written the masnufacturer to let them know.<br />Amazon has greta customer care."
5,"These bars are great, however, this item can be purchased for 7.49 at Sams Club.  Same box"
4,These taste terrific and my grandkids call them candy bars and consider them a special treat!  They prefer the chocolate chip - I love the dark chocolate almond!
5,For the longest time they would not ship this to APOs. I don't know why. Maybe they were afraid the yummy super bubble gum would fall into the hands of the enemy. Get flavor and one piece works. I chew gum every day in the gym because I grind my teeth when lifting. helps alot.
3,"I've purchaesed twice so far and in both boxes the gum was really hard.  Product is great, but I wouldn't purchase again through amazon due to it being so hard to chew."
5,"I am addicted to Super Bubble Bubble Gum. I ordered four boxes and was very pleased with the promptness, packaging, and product."
5,"Simply the best dates I've ever had. All natural, no preservatives or sugars (surprised? Some dates have added sugars). I stopped buying any other dates once I discovered those."
1,"I ordered this saffron after looking at seller feedback and assumed that since this is expensive it will be premium quality.<br />But only after i put it in water for sometime, then the color of the flakes changed, and I realized that its a fake one.<br />Dont waste your time on this."
1,"It did not really taste like much, so I was able to add sauce without interrupting the flavor, however I could not get past the texture. I'd rather chew on rubber bands."
1,"I would like to try this, however I do not see anything that says exactly what this product is made of, did I miss something? They only say what it is not! Would really like to know."
5,"this is a delicious tea, light and sweet with no aftertaste.  I highly recommend it to any tea drinkers who want a black tea, but one that is not too strong or bitter.  Needs no additional sweetening."
5,I love this stuff.  I tried it earlier this summer while on Cape Cod and immediately had to go find some upon returning home!  It is like drinking chocolate!  It is dutch chocolate mixed with red wine.  mmmm.  New fave!
1,"The shipment was Prime but arrived in 5 days instead of 2.<br />I love dark french roast coffee, but, this coffee tasted burnt and additionally, the flavor had overtones of trash Indonesian.  Not a pleasant experience."
5,I am a coffee fiend and this was surprisingly good for the price.  I accidently bought the ground instead of the bean but it was very fresh and more of an espresso grind.
2,"this is not a review of the product, but the seller/shipper. I ordered this on september 22nd. It is now october 9th and I still have not received the item."
5,It arrived in great condition. It was a gift for my 13 year old son. It already has lots of new baby green leaves on it. Excellant product and great price.
5,I've never had a bonsai before and was unsure where to go. I purchased the Japanese Juniper starter kit and when it arrived I was thrilled. Everything I needed was there and the instructions are very clear. The tree is very healthy and never showed any signs of stress. Thank You Eve's Garden!
5,"Ordered for my daughter who loves Bonsai trees. Arrived in good condition and she had fun potting it.  Just received it so will have to wait and see what the survival rate is, but so far so good."
5,Product was in good condition and met all my expectations.  The Bonsai was healthy and in excellent shape.  Potting was easy with instructions provided. My tree is doing very well. I would buy from here again.
5,This is a great intro to Bonsai for beginners.  Product arrived in excellent condition.  Nice packaging. Quality product.  I placed a second order from Eve's Garden immediately folowing this one.
5,"I got my Bonsai tree a day before the said date. It seems a bit roughed up because the accessories inside seemed to have got disorientated inside the box but nonetheless, all is there and intact. It seems of good quality also, thanks! :)"
2,The Bonzai I ordered came well before the estimated date...<br /><br />however... the tree I got as a gift was TINY. Nothing like it looks like in the product picture.
5,"These flavors are so realistic! The rotten egg and sprout flavors almost made me vomit! now when i think of the rotten egg, i feel dizzy. The cake, roasted marshmallow, and cherry ones are SO good though! i would recomand this to anyone!<br />P.S. try the black ones!"
5,"If you are looking for proper nutrition cereal. This one is the best, period.  Low sugar and calorie. High fiber and protein.  What more can one ask for.  Add low fat milk and some frozen fruit and you have a perfect breakfast.  I wish I could buy it in bulk."
5,"You won't believe how good this ""health food"" cereal tastes! Not only is it loaded with protein and low in sugar, it has a fabulous crunch that doesn't get soggy. And it's sweet but not too much so. I just bought another six boxes today, because my kids keep eating it up. Highly recommended!"
5,"This some good sausage seasoning, has a great garlic taste, I use half the recommended seasoning on a 10lb mix and its just right for me. Great product"
1,I know others like salt more than I do but I am not on a salt free diet or anything like that.  I love sausage but this was way too salty for my taste.
5,Just had a can of these and wanted to confirm the great quality of this product. Excellent taste and three big sardines barely fitting into the can. I'll get more ...
1,"The taste is bitter, the smell is atrocious, and they are not naturally smoked.  ""Aqueous natural smoke"" is a chemical stew injected into the fish.  For anyone thinking these are the real thing, all I can say is 'there is a sucker born every minute.'"
4,"I ordered this after returning from Turkey where they served this to the tourists (me) who were shopping in their stores. Not a traditional Turkish drink - one developed to keep the tourists going (high in sugar) and happy. It worked while I was there, I bought a lot. Chocolate and Art Lover"
4,Great tea just like in Turkey.Easy to mix and prepare. My wife thinks it's a little sweet. I love it
4,These arrived nice and fresh. They are a tad more tart than expected but I like them.
5,Very good fruit slices.  The flavor is tart-not too sweet and has a dusting of sugar.  Very good when left out to get a little more solid-not so gel like!
5,"I bought cherry, lime and lemon flavors...all are wonderful. Not too hard and not too soft and with a perfect amount of sugar on them. I'll be back for more soon!"
5,I bought several of these as a birthday party goody bag filler. This is basically ice cream flavored pop rocks but all of the kids loved them and is a very reasonable price.
5,we pace the floor when stewed chicken is not available.  This is baby dogs favorite food mixed with chef michaels dry chicken kibble.  He loves this to distraction.  Never seems to get tired of it.
5,"This coffee has a full, rich flavor, exactly what a dark roast should taste like. Swiss-water process decaf is a must for me."
5,This is the best decaf around and it is Free Trade too.  We first found it when we were spending a week near Invermere and were thrilled to find it on Amazon.
5,"I've been ordering the Kicking Horse decaf, along with the Three Sisters regular blend, for over a year now - it's great coffee, and arrives fresh and fast.  Much better deal than buying the little 12 oz bags in coffee shops!"
5,I love this coffee!  It has very good flavor for decaf.  I have been looking for a good decaf coffee because i've been trying to give up caffeine - and this is the best one I have found so far.
5,"I looked a long time for dark roast decaf that tasted like this one does.The package doesn't say where it is grown, but it tastes like Columbian beans to me. I hope Amazon keeps handling it. GREAT COFFEE, Gerald"
5,"First time user, but will order more!  The decaf is Swiss Water filtered, no chemicals, and we just discovered they offer 1/2 decaf, 1/2 regular coffee so you get the jolt, but not as much, which may be a great compromise, also dark roast!"
5,"The coffee was great or is great ,but the bag said not for resale . I'm not sure where the seller got it . The bag was sealed and never opened.Which I was greatfull."
5,"I was never an eggnog fan until I tried this in a gourmet shop. Loved it. Sent my aunt who loves eggnog some and she loved it and requested more. The shop that I found it at sells out all the time. Obviously good stuff!  I never had problems opening container or with it not dissolving well,"
4,"Tis the SEason is over, no more cartons of eggnog, but this is a good substitute<br />thick rich and a taste thats as good as most traditional nogs."
4,I suppose it's about as close as you can get to mass produced (real) egg nog. It is pretty convenient too.
5,"Great taste, inexpensive and easy to store with no going sour. No cholesterol to worry about. The shipping was speedy. Satisfactory transaction. Would purchase this brand again. Would also purchase from Amazon unless they allow pedophiles to sell books again."
5,"Wish I could get this on auto-ship.  Wonderful product, wonderful flavor and wonderful to be able to have it whenever we want!!!"
1,"The eggnog was NOT eggnog - they should try another name, as this is misleading.  The cartons are REALLY DIFFICULT to open - I use a screwdriver."
5,Got a smaller size than 3 pound pack from Fisherman's Fleet; put in the freezer. Defrosted today and opened the bag. Sweet and fresh! No rancid fishy smell. Was very nice baked.
5,These macarons were beautifully packaged and tasted just as good as they looked! I think my favorite flavors were Dark Chocolate Raspberry and Coconut. Mostly likely will order more next time.
4,"My 15 year old loves, I mean adores this treat! I can be assured that she's getting joint nutrients at the same time. Wish it were made in the USA. Maybe some day soon we'll have our own product."
5,I have a Yorkiechon puppy that loves this treat.  Being lamb and rice I think its great for his digestive system.  I will buy it again.
4,I have 2 dogs and this product is used for 'treats'.  I believe that there is some improvement in mobility with the one dog<br />that has a problem getting aroundl
5,"Great product at a great price.  Subscribe and save makes this an exceptional buy.  And oh yeah, my dogs love these too!"
4,"My dog loves these treats and I have been buying them from Target. Found them @ Amazon in bulk and for a much lower per pack price. I got my father's dog hooked on these, too. Now he buys them from Amazon!"
4,"My dog always loved these.  And now I can buy them in bulk on Amazon, instead of overpaying for these at the Vet's office.  Am still concerned a bit that they are made in China, but as long as my dog is doing well and still eats her dry food, we are ok with them."
5,"I have large breed dogs and these are a great way to add valuable joint supplements to their day. They are their favorite treats, too!"
5,"My dog loves this jerkey and since he needs glucosamine, it's an easy way to give him some."
5,My dog has a delicate stomach and she can eat these without bothering her and she loves them.  I keep them on hand and she shares them with her friends when they comes to play!
5,"If your dogs need glucosamine and chondroitin, this is the product for you. It must be tasty because my 14 1/2 year old Westie loves it as does her much younger sister."
5,"I have an older dog, medium size mixed breed with back problems. We also have a tea-cup pom who has had knee surgery. They love this treat. The ingredients are good for them and it is an easy way to get them to take the Glucosamine/Chondroitin that they need."
5,"my shelties love these treats and their breed is known to have hip problems, so happy hips is always on hand in our household."
5,"These treats are the best!  I break them into smaller pieces and use as training treats.  I would recommend dogswell to anyone.  My dogs LOVE these and the chicken jerky.  I love them because they do not cause any digestive ""issues""..."
5,"I have been using this product, as well as the duck breast, for well over a year. There is no comparison to Tail Waggers from [...]. This product is the only one that my 3 dogs will eat without hesitation. They have put their noses up to all other treats, except this brand."
5,I have been giving my dog Happy Hips for several years. It contains glucosamine and condroitin which is good for the joints. Amazon has absolutly the best price out there too. Your dog will beg for these treats.
5,My dogs can not wait to get this treat everyday.  I think the glucosamine helps my older dog's joints.  If your dog has allergies I would go with the lamb and rice over the other flavors.
5,My Dobes would barely let me put the box on the kitchen to open it!  Terrific product at a great price and superior customer service.
3,"My dog refuses to eat these snacks.  I was expected that these snacks have a strong liver smell, however they smell like plastic..."
4,My German Sheperd loves this stuff.  I do wish it came in bigger pieces as they are brittle and tend to break up into small pieces.
5,My dogs are on a special diet so there are few treats I can feed.  These are their favorites and cause no problems for them.
5,I was very happy with the speed of the delivery and the quality of the treats.  My dogs love them.
5,"Our adopted Jack Russells have had eating problems related to going from junk food to organic,  We grind this product and the liver ""terriyaki"" in a coffee grinder and sprinkle it over their pellets to get them started.  Works every time."
5,"My dog (a greyhound), loves these treats. Seems like these have really spoiled him, he rarely eats his other treats now. As for how good these are for him, I really have no idea. Other than him not eating his other treats, there's been no notable difference. He's just as lazy as he was before."
5,our dog is 14 years old and this product is part of an arthritic regiment and it is WONDERFUL she walks like she 6 yrs old.<br />Thanks you
5,My dog can't wait to come back from her walk to get her treat.  She is allergic to a lot of things and these are just perfect.  I love using Amazon so I don't have to go out.
5,"This is a great treat for our yorkie.  She loves the duck and it is good for her.  Please read the amount to give your size dog.<br />Thanks,  Brian"
5,"These are great treats, even for fussy dogs.  The glucosamine and chrondroitin realy do help older dogs with their joints."
1,"My dog loves chicken breast treats. That is, until I bought these. I'm sure this is simply a matter of taste. I don't know if the additives smell different or what's turning him off but he'll pick it up and then just drop it. He refuses to eat them at all."
5,"What else can I say?  They are great, healthy treat. Dogs love them. Apparently I need 20 words to say this treat is yummy and the ..umm.. dogs love them?"
5,"Our three Chihuahuas love this treat and it is good for them (especially the 14 yr. old), but it is expensive in the stores.  I am so glad to have found it at Amazon at a much lower price!"
5,"My dog doesn't like most treats, but loves these.  She gives them 4 paws up!<br /><br />The product arrived quickly and saved me a half-hour drive to a pet store."
5,These dried chicken breasts are a healthy treat. They are expensive so my dogs each get 2 a day. Happy Hips are $16 a bag in grocery and pet stores so 3 bags for $30 is a real deal and they are worth it.
5,I like the Dogswell Happy Hips Chicken Breast because of the quality and lack of chemical additives. And both my cat and dog would eat only this if they could. Ordering auto ship saves even more from Amazon's discount pricing.
5,"My dogs eat this product every day, and I rather other the pack of three because I have 4 dogs.  Thanks again Amazon."
5,I got exactly what I anticipated I would.  My dogs start every single day with a Dogswell Happy Hips Chicken strip.
5,"The treats are my dogs' all-time hands-on favorite. Buying them in the three pack makes sense: I always have them on-hand for them. They are packed well, and arrive quickly each time."
5,"My dog loves these and everyone I have shared with agrees it's a great snack. Why feed grains and ""dog bones"" when you can offer a high protein healthy snack that promotes good health!"
5,My Dog loves Dogswell Happy Hips duck breast strips.  I put a couple in his kong ball and he plays and plays.  One of his favorite treats.  good for him and not fattening.
5,"our dog, biggie, loves these things.  and never seems to get tired of em.  these are the treats that make him do all his tricks with gusto cuz he wants them so bad!  i dunno if the glucosamine/chondroitin really helps their joints but we're hoping it does."
5,My thirteen year old Yorkshire Terrier loves Dogswell Happy Hips Chicken breast strips and the glucosomine has helped her arthritis a great deal.  She jumps and runs like a puppy again!  My five year old yorkie loves them too!  I highly recommend this product.
5,"We have two Great Pyrenees. One is 13 and the other is turning 9. As with all large breed dogs hips are a problem. What is more of a problem is getting them to take medications. Happy Hips is the solution. Our doggies love the taste, and they get the meds they need."
3,"My dog is crazy for the Dogswell chicken strips but these she's not excited about. These are crunchy like a pressed cracker, not a meat strip, and not as chewy."
5,"This stuff literally smells like bbq'd chicken! It's actually that good.<br />My dog will do anything to get these treats, plus they're totally healthy.<br />Will be buying these again."
5,"My very fussy pug, Zoe absolutely loves the chicken strips and I feel comfortable giving them to her since they are all natural chicken, and easily digestible."
5,"NEVER MET A DOG THAT DIDN""T LIKE THEM & THEY ARE GOOD FOR THEIR HIPS!"
5,A hands down favorite of my dogs. Glucosamine & Chrondrotin is a favorite recommendation from my vets. No better way to get it than in a tasty chewy (not hard) treat.
5,My dog goes crazy for these. And looking at the ingredients they look good for him too.<br />Joel Simkhai
5,I don't know what they put in this stuff but my dogs go absolutely crazy for it and the Amazon price was by far the lowest.<br /><br />Rich
1,"Thought these were healthy treats, but found out that they are Made in China.  Noted on back of bag.  Concerned that it may fall into China made Jerky treats suspected to cause kidney problems in pets."
5,"This is great product, but for small dogs make sure you break it up in smaller pieces. Almost lost my dog due to impaction due to him eating too fast. I feel good feeding this to my dogs!"
1,"consumer lab reports that in dogswell happy hips the condroitin level is not acceptable, to low"
5,I used to buy these from a local pet store but this 3 pack is the best deal going.  I intend to continue purchasing this product.
5,I have two dogs who have had some hip problems.  This product has truly helped their recovery.  I can recommend this product without any reservations.  They love the product and it has worked.
5,"These treats are great, my dog loves them.  I can't say for sure they do anything for her hips but she really enjoys them.  She recommends them highly:)"
5,"Product came in as expected, timely, and well packaged. I knew already the product from the local stores and I was happy to find at a cheaper price at Amazon.com."
5,"Just like the other Dogswell treats, my three dogs approved of these, and can't get enough of them. I think this makes our eight year old black lab (who has arthritis) a little peppier, and less stiff. These treats have all natural ingredients. I would definitely buy again."
5,This is the best dog treat for the best price.  Totally pleased with the whole shopping experience through Amazon.
5,"Having multuple dogs to feed snacks to I can tell you this is their number one choice, hands down. Helping with hip relief is an added perk. This item should get a TEN star rating."
4,"When I run out of these, my dog reluctantly eats other treats, but I can tell she is not happy.  My cats even try to steal them from her.<br /><br />It's hard to find good quality pet snacks without a lot of additives and grain free.  These Dogswell brand are the best."
1,"Made in China, does anything else need to be said?<br /><br />I used to buy them then noticed the label, I will not buy again."
1,"My dogs loved this product and I was happy to spend the money on it, but now that it's made in China- thumbs down, what were they thinking? I'll never buy it again. There are better products made in the USA. If you care about the well being of your dog, you will avoid products made in China."
5,Always been happy with the quality and price of these treats. Receive them quickly and packaged well.  I would recommend this seller.  Nicely done and no worries.
4,"Every morning after they are fed, two of my Poms get Happy Hips and the third wants in on it.  They think it's a great treat and never not want it."
5,"I am so happy I found this product on Amazon! My dog loves these little treats and they really do seem to help her aging joints. However, the dollars add up so finding a reasonably priced site was wonderful! As always, I received them super fast."
5,"Our nine year old, very active, Golden Retriever loves these treats.  We cut several of them up into bite-size pieces and add them to her twice daily meals.  One order lasts us approximately two months, and the Amazon continuous shipping works great."
5,"Besides being tasty, Happy Hips is good for your dog. It's a quality product by a great company dedicated to making only the best food and treats. Also, by signing up for recurring shipments, you are saving money. It's win, win, win."
5,"If you're looking for a never-fail, works-every-time dog treat, look no further. Far superior to any other chicken jerky we've tried, and we've tried at least six. Terrific product at a very good price."
1,I wish I had read that these are made in China before I bought them.  They are going in the trash - lesson learned.
5,"My dog loves these! And, the dogs at the local shelter I volunteer love them too! So much we use them as lures to get them to pose nicely for photos. We're all mutts, adopt one!"
1,"I bought this product last week for our dogs, within a day both were vomiting and refusing food. Our larger dog is doing ok since we stopped feeding them but our little guy is not. Taking both to the vet tomorrow along with these treats."
1,"Used to subscribe to this item, as my dogs loved them, but I just found that they are made in china. I will never feed these to my dogs again or buy anything from the company."
1,"<a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001AJ1ULS"">Dogswell Happy Hips for Dogs, Chicken Breast,15-Ounce Pouches (Pack of 3)</a>Dogswell chicken jerky is now made in China.  The FDA has warned against dog food products made in China.  Don't risk it!"
1,"I used to buy these all the time and had no idea the switched to being made in China! Not trusting this company anymore, they just lost another customer. BUYER BEWARE!"
1,"My dog absolutely loves these and she is very picky however I am returning them due to the numorous recent cases of illnesses and deaths occurring from chicken treats that have been manufactured in China.<br />It is NOT worth the risk to me, sadly to say I will have to find another brand."
5,"Have been using this product for about a year now. My dog loves these chicken jerky treats. It's a great to be able to treat her with something she likes, as well as adding these needed supplements to her diet."
5,These treats look like black licorice and the dogs love them. Amazon's price can't be beat!
5,"My dog, and the local animal shelter dogs, love these! Healthy and a good price on sale!"
5,"By far my dogs favorite treat, it is also very healthy.  My crazy friend decide to taste it, he said it was excellent, a chicken jerky with less fat and preservatives."
5,"My dog loves these things more than any other treat we've ever bought her, but they are pricey.  This supplier sells them for half what the pet chains do and shipping is free."
3,"We have purchased these treats several times for our aging Bichon and been well pleased.  She loves them; however, this last batch is tough and really dried out."
5,"My dogs can't get enough of these and they cost 3 times more at Petco.  love this place. I am on their subscription it is so cool, i no longer have to be worried about running out. Every month here they come, it is so cool. I Love the conveinence and my Dogs (3)LOVE the goodies.  AAAA +++++++++++"
5,My dog LOVES Happy Hips.  Because we have Amazon auto ship she now loves the delivery man because she knows he brings them to her.  She gets very sad if we run out. You can't get any better than Amazon auto ship.
5,"My dog,Lucy, loves these. it's a great way to get her to take glucosamine and chondroiton."
5,I have been buying these treats for over 1 year and my Lab looks forward to this treat after finishing each meal.  All you have to do is mention happy hips and just watch her smile.
4,My dogs are nuts for the Dogswell Happy Hips dried chicekn breasts but they are made in China so I hardly ever give them to my dogs.I wish the company would have them manufactured elsewhere.
5,Great product our dog is loving a tasting treat that is good for her 14 year old bones
5,My dogs loved them. I'm not sure if it's helped their hips at all.<br />But I'll keep giving them the chicken strips to find out.
5,"I give these treats to my dog, and he can't get enough of them.  This is his favorite treat by far, and since it's made of chicken breasts, I feel like it's pretty healthy."
1,"I don't trust dog treats made in China.  As an alternative, there's a good chicken jerky dog treat made by Goodness Gracious - in the USA and using 100% human grade chicken.  [...]"
5,"This is one great product!  Never again do I have to force a pill or some other disgusting thing down my dogs throat to give her glucosamine.  Both my dogs love the Happy Hips, but chicken is their favorite!  This one is a winner!"
1,I bought these from a large chain pet store. after reading the reviews I checked the bag... made in China. I threw the whole bag away. I wish I would have read the reviews first!
1,I have been told by my veternarian that Glucosomin treats with chicken cause urinary problems in dogs and so I wanted to return 3 unopened packages (of 3 each)and the company will not accept returns.  Ridiculous.  They must know how bad they are for animals.
1,"These treats literally made my dog sick, throwing up everywhere. And it wasn't a shock when i read the package which stated Made in China. Weren't chicken treats for dogs that are made in China recalled?"
5,These treats are a wonderful way for me to keep my old dog moving. He enjoys them and I enjoy being able to give him joint supplements and the benefit of real meat in his diet.  Thank you Dogswell for this great product and thanks to Amazon the good price.
1,My dog loves these treats but we recently found out these are made in China. Chicken jerkey products from China need to be avoided. I threw out the rest of these as a result.  Stay away and buy something American made.
1,And they are DRASTICALLY lower in quality.  Do a brief search on the equivalent of the USDA or Dept of Animal Welfare in China.  Guess what?  No existo.  DO NOT BUY.
5,Both dogs love the nutritious treats. The chicken breasts are used sparingly.  Good inducments for getting the pups into the bathtub or out of the house.
1,After finding out whats in Beggin Strips these were recommended to me by a client.  I am a dog groomer.  My Standard Poodle had two this morning and has been vomiting along with diarrhea all day..  enough said..
1,do not fed your dog any happy hip = dogswell product - it is not safe - google it<br />if your dog has eaten them regularly have the vet do blood work
5,"Great price compared to the supermarkets.  My dog loves these and they seem less processed than most dog treats.  I don't know if they really help his hips, but he is a golden retriever (a breed prone to hip problems), so hopefully these will help as he gets older."
5,"Have been very pleased with this product, only some times they are softer then they should be...I like them when they are harder..."
5,"I used this to make homemade pastrami. Very hard to find locally and online. If you are dry curing meats this is necessary.  Made excellent Pastrami many times next I will have to try Bacon ""the maple Kind""."
5,I love this tea. It's delicious and is one of my favorite teas. I like its aroma and taste. I drink it both after and between meals. Highly recommended.
5,"I ordered the Swanson Premium Chunk Chicken Breast in Water, White Meat, 9.75-Ounce Cans (Pack of 12) and my family and I absolutely loved it!  This was, without a doubt, the best canned chicken we have ever eatten; and it is the closest to fresh we've ever tasted."
4,"this is great for a sandwich, with crackers, & my wife uses it in a pasta casserole. It is also economical."
5,"I love Swanson Premium Chuck Chicken Breast, I keep it in my pantry, it is good for chicken salad, I use it in casseroles where chicken can be used..good flavor, and nice amount of chicken in the can, some products are more liquid then product. Not this one."
2,"If you are going to take Noni take pure Noni, not one with juice added, I didn't read that it contained the raspberry juice"
5,The best chocolate that I have ever eaten. Arrived in perfect condition. If there would be more stars - it deserves them all.<br />Love it.
5,These bars are huge! The price is phenomenal for the amount and quality of chocolate and nuts.<br />I'm glad that I went for the quantity to get the best deal. I can always put a couple bars in the freezer.
5,"Huge Chocolate bars would be similar to 5 regular chocolate bars and twice as thick, a bargain at the price really. The best tasting chocolate I have ever had."
5,you can never be disappointed by Lindt. Especially their Hazelnut ones.<br /><br />this one has full hazelnuts in it. crazily delicious. got to try
5,"What can I say....Luscious milk chocolate, melt in your mouth ecstasy, with yummy crunchy hazelnuts.....10.5 ounces of pleasure!  Even better than that, a five pack, with FREE SHIPPING! That's the cheapest price I have found anywhere!"
5,This is good smooth harissa.<br />This brand is the most commonly found in France and my Moroccan Grandma was swearing by it.<br />I would get a lot more if the shipping charge were not so ridiculous!
5,"I love this sauce, I saw it from the food network and found it at Amazon.  can't stand the shipping charge, the sauce itself is cheap though.  I rubbed it on stake, I can taste tomato and garlic with heat in it, it was sooooo good!"
5,I love the tubes of hrissa!  There is much less waste and the flavor is just as wonderful as the same product in the cans.
4,"These miniature hersheys are delicious, PERIOD. Very satisfying for a Diabetic, as well, although not a low calorie snack and fairly expensive."
1,"I have tried several different types of sugar-free chocolates and this is one of the worst.  Instead, I recommend the Dove dark chocolate and the Russell Stover coconut."
5,"I began purchasing this coffee at a small boutique coffee shop not far from where I live.  Now I have 5 lbs. of it delivered to my door on a predetermined schedule.  Life's good!  The coffee is amazing, only for you die hard coffee drinkers though."
4,I like these. They are not gas-producing and they hold shape OK for canned beans. Flavor is good. Love that they don't have added salt.
4,"I made a vegan burrito and it tasted almost like burrito, but the more I made this recipe, the less appetite I became with this bean. I guess it's good once in a while.."
4,"We've had great success with all of the cashews we've tried. In doing the work as far as our best buy, the (4)16oz are a better buy than these at 21oz pack of 2."
5,great product  fresh and delivered on time  will buy again  k
5,"5 stars for the product. But how can Target with all the overhead that Amazon doesn't have sell cashews at a lower price? Okay, if you add sales tax the price difference narrows. Still, why buy from here when Target has a better price, even including sales tax?"
1,"I just bought the same two items at my local store for<br />less, except they were not marked value pack."
4,These are pleasantly sweet with a nice vanilla/cinnamon flavor.<br />They are good for eating but not for making pie crusts. I won't<br />be buying them again as they are too expensive for the amount<br />of product you get. Shame because I really liked them.
3,These are a good cookie. I was hoping for something lighter but in all they had a good taste but no real crunch. Unfortunately just about every cracker arrived broken or nearly smashed. Perhaps we will add them to vanilla ice cream.....
3,"I ordered these to make s'mores. I liked the ingredient list, no HFCS. However, they come more like a box of Wheat Thins.<br />They are not large enough for s'mores, and many of them are broken upon arrival.<br />They do taste good though, as a sweet snack."
5,Very delicious! Made with butter so the caramel taste is excellent! The nuts are the topping on the cake! Yummy!
5,"I was thrilled when I found, Walkers Brazil Nut Toffee, online at a good price. This brought back good memories, as it was a favorite of my Dad. I will be buying more. Highly recommend this toffee."
4,"These peanuts are so far superior to the ones in the supermarket, there is no comparison. Once you taste them, you won't go back.<br />Really delicious."
5,"The best peanuts I have ever purchased, tasted, or served.  Shipments are always fresh and the company offers several flavors."
5,"Are you living to Eat or eat to live type of guy?<br />Well, if you'r either then you're just lame.<br />I....WE are all Eat Peants forever mofo types.<br /><br />So, buy these peanuts. And get down with the<br />Eat Peanuts forever mofo type, mofo."
3,"The peanuts were of average quality. They were large enough and salted properly, but they were hardly crisp. In my opinion, they are still better than those that you will find in a supermarket, but nothing really exciting."
3,"Nothing spectacular here. Unlike the other reviewers, I found mine fairly salty. I think I'll try other brands before considering buying this again."
5,I think that these are the best peanuts I have ever tasted.  Just enought salt and most of the nuts are still whole.
5,"I moved from Michigan to Georgia and had not be able to locate Fontinella Cheese. I found it on Amazon, have since ordered it several times!  The cheese was mailed from Parthenon Foods.  And where better to get cheese from than Wisconsin!  Thanks Amazon and Parthenon Foods!"
5,"I've always used Knorr Bearnaise Sauce, but lately couldn't find it anywhere, so I ordered it online.  Great taste, fast shipping."
5,"Low carb, no sugar, and delicious.  They satisfy a sweet tooth and just one will suppress any feelings of hunger for several hours.  A good substitute if you're used to snacking."
2,"I love these - they taste great.  But I get them in the local Dollar Store. Two stars for the value, five for taste."
1,It isnt even wroth being sugar free. my stomach is aching and I am getting so much gas. I would rather stick with the normal werthers. I cant believe i bought 12 bags of this crap...
5,"I eat these whenever I feel the urge to ""snack"". It's really satisfies any cravings and does not have an after taste."
4,"I think these taste pretty good. There are lots of nuts & and a few raisins in these slightly bigger than bite sized cookies. You get 54 cookies for the price, so it is sort of pricey but they use quality ingredients so it is probably worth it."
5,"The Old Fashioned Raisin Walnut cookies are a delicious soft cookie, very simlar to the Archway soft cookies I used to eat in both texture and flavor. I wish Pamela's made a date filled, that would be perfect! I have to be careful with these or I will eat a whole box in on sitting."
5,I have been using this product for years and was happy to find it on line since our local place (Bristol Farms) had closed.  I love it especially in my salad dressings.
5,"I absolutely cannot be without my Spike - it is my one essential seasoning and I use it on almost everything.  Buying it in bulk is cost effective and insures that even when I can't find it in the stores, I'll never run out."
5,"I have used Spike as a seasoning for many years, and when I moved to NY, started using cheaper brands that were convenient.  However, I have never like them, and decided to go back to Spike simply because the flavors it brings to my food are so much better>"
5,"Want a seasoning you can put on EVERYTHING?  Spike seasoning is absolutely one of the best things out there since buttered bread :)  Very, very good :)"
5,Very happy I made this purchase.  It is exactly what you think it is and is a good value.  Arrived very quickly.  Spike is honestly the best.
5,I have tryed other multifuncutional seasoning and nothing surpasses spike.<br />The taste alone will amaze you. I use spike on every and all things that I cook even eggs.
5,"I have been using spike seasoning for about six years.  And I think it is just great, I use it on almost all meats, in soups and stews, on caserolls."
5,"These crackers are a great way to get whole wheat into your diet & into children's.  They are low in fat & sugar, and they taste great.  I haven't met a child yet who doesn't like them.  The ingredients are good as well."
5,The Bahlsen Delobas are my favorite so far. Call them biscuits or call them cookies they are just plain good. Light and pastry like with a nice burst of sweetness from the red current jam. Try Them!
5,Great texture and balance of sweet to butter is just about right. Adults and kids both love them. Recommended
5,We were buying Bahlsen cookies at $1.70-$2.19 at lockal supermarket until I found that they are $1.41/box here at Amazon!
5,"If you love the heavenly combination of chocolate and orange, then this<br />is a cookie to try.  Gotta have your coffee and treat everyday like moi.<br />Well this plays well with coffee. Yum gonna have some right now...."
5,"The title says it all! These butter biscuits are DIVINE! Everyone loves them--my parents, my students, my colleagues, and, of course, me! You will love them, too!"
5,These are every bit as good as the other two reviewers stated. Awesome butter cookies!!! There's a lot of butter taste in these cookies and they're not overly sweet. Just right! I'll be buying again when the 12 pack runs out. Amazon please make sure you keep these in stock on a continuing basis!
5,"These Bahlsen Butter Leaves are the best cookies! Not too sweet, not greasy, soooo ""just right!"" Order extra! They go fast!"
5,I love this chocolate covered cookies. The chocolate is pure and tasty. Not too sweet.
5,These cookies didn't disappoint.  They are delicious and go really well with a cup of tea or coffee.  They have just the right amount of sweetness...not cloying.  (I think American desserts usually go overboard on sugar).  I highly recommend them.
5,Love these tea biscuits. The price was great for a box of 12. I hope you continue to carry.
5,"i tried bahlsen chocolates in europe, but you can't find them very often in the states. these are unlike any usa chocolates i've eaten, the wafer is wrapped over itself 4-5 times. you can't beat the crunch these make, delicious."
5,Having grown up on these cookies I was pleased to see that they now come in the more healthful whole wheat version.  Same great taste...light on the sugar...even my husband who hates sweets will eat these with his ice cream.
5,"These are soo good with a nice cup of coffee. They are light, buttery and very flavorful with the finely chopped nuts."
5,better than grahm crakers and they do not spike your blood sugar (at least not mine.)
5,Once you try this piece of chocolate you will fall in love with it. Probably one of the best nonbar chocolates produced in Switzerland and Europe as a whole. And I think it is rather cheap for the quality you get.
4,We've ordered for them every month and only once the package inside the seal had a small hole and wasn't as fresh.
5,This product was delivered on time and included more than I thought I was going to get - a full 16 packages. I first purchased these in England and have loved them ever sense.
5,Will always buy these if I can find them. Hate to have to buy from Germany. Need a grocery store.
3,I was not very happy when i recieved my order. All the cookies were melted. Very good product. Word of advise. Don't buy any products in the summer time that will melt.
5,I grew up eating these cookies.  Got a case for a great price.  Will be looking for them again this fall.
5,"Leibniz cookies are truly my favorite, beyond what I make, I am a passionate cook. The whole wheat version of these are particularly superb with a subtly greater flavor than the original and a lovely, slightly more crumbly and grainy texture. It has been a wonderful discovery. Bon appetit."
5,"It tastes perfect. I like it.<br />You would ""feel"" the butter in the cookies."
5,"Great cookies.  Not overly sweet as most American cookies can be, with a hint of citrus.  Could not ask for more.  There is only 12 or so cookies in the box, but a decadent treat."
5,these cookies are a perfect treat....very light and crunchy wafer sweetened by  the right amount of chocolate....great price and fast service
5,If you've had these cookies already - no one needs to sell them to you. I would just recommend that you keep them in the freezer. That way they're sort of hidden from you (and others) but for some reason freezing them brings out the taste and consistency of the chocolate. Try it!
5,"These are great!  And they can get to be habit forming if you are not careful.  I bought the whole case, because you save overall  versus going to the supermarket.  Very rich dark chocolate, crisp cookie.  Worth every penny.  Oreo, eat your heart out!"
5,"These cookies are just wonderful!!! The chocolate is deep, dark, rich and melts very nicely in your mouth.  I would say that it is a bittersweet chocolate and very finely made. These cookies give the chocolate lover a satisfying chocolate experience. Do not hesitate to buy them!"
5,A light and crisp flaky cookie surrounding a brightly flavorful nugget of jam. The only problem - I can eat a whole box without stopping to breathe! And buying them by the case makes them very affordable. My next order is already in...
5,I first had these cookies at our Oktoberfest where they were giving out samples.  I loved them and could not find them at World Market so I went to the internet and found them available at Amazon. They are very light and flaky.
5,"When we couldn't find these in our local grocery store anymore, we were very glad to find them available through Amazon. these are light and delicious and a true treat!"
5,"Buy more than one box - these disappear fast! Bahlsen Biscuits are elegant, impressive, and delight everyone. I keep some on hand for unexpected guests and these ""Hazelnut Biscuits"" have never disappointed anyone! (Betcha YOU could eat a whole box yourself!)"
1,"Delicate ground hazelnut cookies for a Ladies tea, NOT for children or most men! Appreciated only by sophisticated palates, because they are neither cloyingly sweet or fatty. Set these aside for unexpected guests you'd like to impress."
1,"Amazon sends you TWELVE boxes of these fabulous cookies and each box disappears FAST - in fact, DO NOT sit down with the whole box nearby or you will munch thru all of them without stopping! They are delicately sweet, crunchy, and buttery - without being at all greasy. You've been warned!"
5,This Gevalia French Roast coffee is fresh tasting and bold!  It's fantastic considering its preground coffee.  I really love it!
4,I wanted to try these prunes and was truly suprised at the taste they imparted. They are semi-sweet with a fruity perfume like aroma. The reason I gave them 4 stars is that they have a fairly large pit and it does take care in eating them. Caution: this is not a small child food!!
1,"<a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001EQ5M3Y"">Sadaf Pitted Prunes Black, 12-Ounce Packages (Pack of 4)</a><br /><br />This item was full of mold (fungus) on reciept!"
5,My husband cannot get enough of this product.  He practically licks the can clean!!  The nuts are delicious and Amazons prices and shipping are the lowest.  You get your order in a remarkably quick time.
4,I was not able to located these specific nuts (coffee glazed) at any store in Seattle where I live. So I checked Amazon and sure enough they were available and at a fair price. I ordered them on line and they arrived in good shape when you said they would. All in all a good experiece. Thanks
5,"Kona coffee glaze macadamia nuts are ""serious num-nums"".  I consider it my ultimate treat and I like to treat myself."
5,"These are as good as ever. Both my son,my wife and I just love them. I just wish I could get them in a larger size. Amazon beat all other prices by $10.00 The only way to get a better deal is to buy them in HAWAII"
5,I am addicted to Macadamia Nuts.  I have a standing order to send nuts every 3 month.  Mauna Loa Nuts have been always fresh.
5,Anyone searching for stage 3 of gestational banana trajectories would be well advised to procure this item immediately.  It is an essential purchase.  That is all.
2,The bag we received from Amazon had hollow biscuits and were harder than the ones we purchased from a local store.  Were these a reject batch?  Certainly over baked or dried out!  Our bichon had a hard time biting into it.
5,"Shame on me for not checking out the price before buying.  Paid $3 too much.  But it is a good product if you have a dog with allergies.  My dog loves the treats.  Will definately buy this product again, but not from this website."
5,"So I order through Amazon and wah-lah instant ""happy"" and tasty too. Not pasty/powdery tasting as other instants and the full flavor of pistachio comes through to compliment desserts."
5,My dog absolutely loves these treats and he goes nuts every time I bring them out.  Not sure if they are helping his digestion but they don't seem to have any adverse affects either.
5,"This product is great. The flavor was to die for. I will purchase again, when my sugar high goes away?  : D"
1,"These look very tasty and me being a candy freak i had to try them. To say the least i was extremely dissapointed. They have a chemical taste and the texture is like chewing glue. Very nasty, i would never eat or buy these again and that goes for any of the flavors."
5,I have to agree with the other review this flavor is my favorite! These treats are amazing!
5,I tried successfully to make fresh rolls first time. Very easy. Good product. Worked consistently since. I recommend it highly.
2,"Just be aware.....the first ingredient on the list is salt.  I don't find this product very peppery, hot or spicy.  It is a disappointment."
5,I have been using Core Power (formerly Athlete's HoneyMilk) for over a year and I won't use any other product. I add it to smoothies and even use it in recipes that call for milk. If you are tired of the chalky tasting 'milks' out there then stop looking and start drinking Core Power.
5,Vanilla is by far my favorite flavor.  It tastes like vanilla bean ice cream so you'd never know you were doing something good for your body.  Lactose free so it's tummy friendly and packed full of protein for a post workout recovery.  This drink couldn't get any better!
5,"This product is delishy.  I did a 10K recently and decided this would be my recovery drink of choice that day.  Forget the amazing nutrient content in the bottle, the flavor is fantastical.  I highly recommend to anyone looking to mix up their recovery routine."
5,"These Namaste muffins are by far the best gluten free muffins I've discovered in 7 years!  Even better if you add crushed pineapple and coconut, or raisins and cinnamon.  Outstanding product and easy to make."
5,"I purchased this item as a make up bag and it was perfect. It can be hung or laid out flat, you can see all of your products so they are easy to grab, and there was even space for my brushes.  I would not recommend it for a toiletries bag as it would be too small for me."
5,"THe color i got is red and looks extremely good in person, I love it, it goes well with everything and looks great."
5,This case holds a lot and can still fold up well. Great function and looks nice too. The magnet works very well to keep it closed. I'm impressed with this product and will probably look at more of their travel accessories.
5,"This is a great little carry all for my make up!! It is a little smaller than I expected, but I can carry my Clairsonic Mia in it, my make up and a few more items in it, so it will do the job!!"
2,"This is a very pretty container, and my granddaughter loved the blue color when mixed with water-- but--- it tastes more like coconut than chocolate-- should be labeled hot coconut drink."
3,"This cocoa is like any other cocoa, other than it is white and turns pink when touches liquid.  The tin is cute, but 2 cans were dented when they arrived. Not sure if it was from shipping or the seller.  A bit over priced in my opinion as well."
5,If you have the munchies....you'll like these. Get them on sale....the only downside is I wish they held up better in milk...they go soggy fast...and they still taste great.
5,I love this cereal! I remember Life cereal as a kid.  It has the perfect balance of fiber and cinnamon without being too sweet.
5,"I love life cereal, these boxes didn't last long but I got a great price during the special. Tasted great."
5,I grew up eating the original Life cereal and immediately switched to the cinnamon variety when they released it years ago. This is my favorite cereal and I am already out of the two 4-packs I ordered two weeks ago.
5,Like these with subtle hint of Cinnamon and low sweetness. Nice improvement over some other too sweet Cinnamon cereals. I think the packaging may add up too much to the cost - shall be able to buy in large packets for the family.
4,"Good stuff, cinnamon and Life Multi-grain cereal, which I hear is better for you. Excellent price, hard to go wrong here."
5,A BOWL OF THIS IN THE MORNING IS GOOD STUFF. I ADD FRUIT AND NUTS TO AUGMENT THE TASTE. IT IS A GOOD AND HEALTHY WAY TO START THE DAY. IT HELPS KEEP ME REGULAR.
2,"This is one of my favorite cereals. But purchase it only if you don't mind eating it in powder form. What you get is mostly powder, not crunchy squares. I will not be ordering again, sorry."
5,"I have 4 children, I find these kind of offers a great way to keep the larder full, and the budget on track."
5,Got at a great price.  A little slow (backordered) but worth the wait (savings).  Other than the UPS man using this as a booster seat along the way - all is good otherwise.
5,"My 2-year old loves these cheerio-like banana flavored snacks. He prefers them to Cheerios. He has also tried the Blueberry flavored version of these snacks, and highly dislikes them, but I think that's just because he isn't a huge fan of blueberries. These are a hit, though!"
5,"My whole family loves these. Not just for babies. These are wholesome organic snacks. If you love bananas, then these are an excellent snack.<br />Great for the whole family any age. I plan to have these as a staple snack in our home."
1,I was disappointed to receive Earth's Best Organic Snakin' Fruit Rings Banana because it hurt my child when she bit into the hard and stale treat.
5,These are so awesome I almost don't want to share them with my kids ;)<br />I  had to order a couple more at this price also
5,"my kids prefer the banana to the blueberry variety which is fine by me since these are usually a dollar or 2 cheaper. Perfect for snacks, car trips, and just about anything else you can think of. Extremely convenient lid keeps them fresh. Cannot say enough good things about these!"
5,"Great with BBQ, we have discovered and focusing on Team Fox for Parkinson's Research is what 4 Foxes Zinfandel is all about! Enjoy this wine to celebrate bbq's, birthdays or any celebration and know you've also helped raise money for Team Fox!<br />Cheers ~ Jessica Locke, Wines 4 Cures"
5,"I love this product, if you like cheese on you're popcorn this is a must try."
1,Absolutely NO cheese flavor at all. All you can taste is salt salt salt. Save your money and try something else.
5,"I had used this product for years, but no longer could find it locally.  Was very pleased to find it on Amazon!  Keep in mind, there's no need for added salt -- this is cheesy AND salty.  Yummmm!"
5,My family loves this cheese salt and its very hard to find in stores.  So happy to have found it on amazon.  I bought 12 bottles to share with everyone.
5,this is a great topping for popcorn and i have been using it for years.<br /><br />PS I had written Amazon on October 6th when I received the order because 2 of the bottles were broken--I have not gotten a response.  would appreciate acknowledgement!
5,"When I couldn't find this product in my grocery store or other stores I shop in I decided to check out Amazon and yea, it was here! My husband and I love this seasoning on our popcorn, really good!!! Speedy delivery, thanks!!"
1,I bought this at a local Albertsons recently and it is not at all as advertised.  There is no cheesy flavor detectable in the product.  Even the salt flavor is off.  Avoid this product.
1,Reese changed their Cheesy Popcorn Seasoning.  It is more salt than cheese.  In fact it has very little cheese flavor left.  I will not be purchasing this product again.
5,Reese's is consistently excellent.  Always makes the popcorn taste great.<br /><br />Wouldn't use any other brand.  I buy in bulk.<br /><br />I prefer the plain salt version (no additives) - but cheesy is quite good.
5,"Very good!!! Tried it years ago. Whole foods, for some reason, decided to stop carrying Eden Foods(in my area). So I am HAPPY that Amazon has come to the rescue. The garlic taste is subtle. Cooks up well. JUst wish that it could be pruchased by the bag and not the case.It's a must try."
2,"This is an okay gift box, only if you like mediocre cheese and summer sausage. The items are small, smaller than they appear in the picture. I only paid $30, but I would not purchase it again. On the positive side, the mustard samples that come with it make the items edible."
5,We had a minor issue with the packaging of our order but the company made it right VERY quickly. I am very impressed with their customer service! Thanks for a great experience! :)
5,My wife thinks it is the best in the world and I think Stonewall Kitchen is the best
4,We added these to some salt water taffy in the favors for my step-daughter's beach themed wedding. They were a lovely addition and realy added to the theme.
3,"What? This product is NOT what is showed in the photo. Instead of the box of Xtra Sour Goo which was shown, I recieved Monster Goo, which is NOT what I wanted to get. This company does not send you exactly what is in the photo, so watch out."
3,"I was very excited to get this product as I used to love their toasted pumpkin seed oil. Unfortunately I couldn't taste the pistachio flavor. So because of the price & lack of taste, I wouldn't purchase it again.<br /><br />Great company though. Michael is a great guy.<br /><br />Michelle"
4,"I love pistachio nuts and I also like working with nut oils of all kinds. I had not even thougth of using pistachio oil.<br />After purchasing this oil and using it once as a salad dressing(spinach,nectarines and toasted pistachios) I am sold and am on a hunt for more ideas..I would welcome ideas."
2,Thank god that i tasted the metal before i swallowed them. I dont even get how it got mixed up with this. The candy itself is sex in mouth.
5,"I love this tea, I don't drink anything with caffeine in it and my grocery store doesn't carry  this flavor in decaf, so I was thrilled to get it here, plus it was cheaper!"
5,"Every evening includes a cup of Bigelow decaffeinated French Vanilla Tea and if there is a movie included in my evening plans, I will enjoy two cups of this tea."
5,"I have to admit I love this tea, I put splenda in it and the taste is so wonderful. I have probably went through 7 6pack boxes this year alone, not counting the other teas i drink. This is a must try hot or cold.."
5,Used to be able to find this in my local Walmart but they stopped carrying it. So I was very happy when I could order it through Amazon.
5,"This tea is wonderful and soothing, and even more soothing to get it shipped to the house!  I have found it hard to find decaffeinated tea in the grocery store, so this is much easier."
5,"My husband and I love this french vanilla decaf tea--but our local grocery stores now only carry the caffeine French Vanilla Tea. Luckily, I found it for sale on Amazon--even cheaper!"
5,Our local stores have stopped carrying this product in the Decaf version.  I found the Decaf is smoother tasting than the Regular French Vanilla.  I bought 4 boxes I was so excited to see it.  I have enough to last for a while now!!
1,This product was very good when I began buying it but lately it is terrible. There is no taste at all. That's the reason I no longer purchase this item. Thank you.
3,There was not as much flavor as I remembered from my previous purchase of this tea at the local grocery store.  Could not get it locally anymore and am wondering if product was discontinued and this was old merchandise.
5,The french vanilla decaf tea is an excellent full body tea that makes two cups. I have been purchasing this tea from Bigalow for years and am now happy that i can purchase this through Amazon
5,"Great vanilla smooth taste plain or I also add a little 1% milk and a sweet n' low for a relaxing treat without any guilt.<a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000GG0BPW"">Bigelow Decaffeinated French Vanilla Tea, 20-Count Boxes (Pack of 6)</a>"
5,"These little tea bags pack a punch of flavor, and it is a nice clean french vanilla taste. No strange chemical aftertastes.  I make iced tea with regular decaf black tea and throw in some of these for a nice added flavor bonus."
3,Not as strong of a taste or smell like other teas.  Still good for a nice hot cup of tea
5,I love just about anything Vanilla and this tea is one of my faves! Its great for a yummy treat during the day without the caffeine.
1,"Once again, Paragon has disappointed with this flavor. The Hawaiian Tropic, simply did not carry much flavor, and what you could taste was not pleasant at all. I do not recommend this syrup concentrate."
5,these peppercorns are fresh and spicy.  they are<br />just what i wanted.  Nice size and i think they are<br />are great value.
5,This is the highest grade of peppercorns I have ever had.  It's 30 cents less per ounce than bulk peppercorns where I shop and they smell and taste so much better.  This cook is very very pleased.
5,Not a expert and I have no complaints with this product or the shipment of this product. I will add more info if I try other products.
5,"Spicy, super fresh, perfect on just about everything, and an AMAZING value.  This huge container will last us a long time.  Good stuff."
4,This was a good price for so much pepper.  It keeps me from having to keep buying pepper which is expensive at the stores.
5,Always try try to ration my spice usage. Getting a fresh batch and smelling and tasting the change in my dishes made me realize how I've been cheating myself by being thrifty. Use it or loose it. So much less expensive then retail grocery.
4,I bought these for my son because they are gluten free. He seems to like them. I thought that they lacked taste. I would have preferred a little more cinnamon taste.
5,"I like the taste and texture of these and so does my husband.<br /><br />They aren't cheerios and no, you won't find anything close to cheerios when eating gluten free."
2,I bought this cereal for my kids (ages 6 and 7) who can't eat gluten any more.  They won't eat it.  I think it passes to at least finish the box but my kids would be happy to throw it out.
4,"My son loves these, thank goodness.  They hold up well in soymilk for ceral in the morning and also hold up well in snack bags.  He is constantly needing 'O' shaped cereal for projects at school, and these work great.  They are a bit sweet, but he doesnt mind."
4,"This cereal, while not EXACTLY the same as Cheerios, is VERY VERY close and even my husband, who is not GF, eats it! It is perfect for GF families, especially those with a toddler who is needing to eat cereal and be Gluten Free! Good buy for the price also!"
1,"I was optimistic about this, but neither the people nor the dogs would eat this cereal.  We threw out all 6 boxes."
5,"Geez what a rip off, WINCO does carry this stuff, Winco is the only place I have found it (I look everywhere I go) and they only charge $2.79 a box & I save that outrageous shipping charge as well :)<br />I bought 8 boxes last time, I'm addicted!"
4,"Some product work needs to be done on the discs. I have wasted several of the milk creamers that would not ""read"" properly resulting in milk leaking all over the tassimo machine. It did not happen with Starbucks packages."
5,My daughter is a teacher and was having lessons on space travel.  Being able to find the Astronaut Ice Cream was a real treat.  The items arrived quickly and in very good condition.
5,both the kids and adults loved eating this treat. product tasted great and melted in the mouth. would definitely buy again.
5,This seller offered the best price i could find on the web.  I was pleased with the speed of delivery.<br /><br />the product was in great shape and well packed.  I'll do business with this company again!<br /><br />kids love astronaut ice cream!
4,We have made this in a slow cooker which took longer than making it on the stove but was more convenient.  It is not quite as good as some home made and restaurant kheer I have tasted but still very nice
2,"I was expecting a larger granual suger and am dissapointed in this product. I might as well have used normal grocery store ganular sugar (i.e., Domino).  Not worth returning and I would not buy again. It certainly doesn't fit my description of ""sanding"" sugar."
5,This was an addition to my sprinkles for Christmas cookies.  It was fun to use. Made my cutout cookies much prettier than I ever imagined.  No problem with item or seller!! Excellent!!
5,Very pleased. Expensive but worth the cost to me because of the beautiful soft luster it adds to my baked goods. Shaker and pour openings for easy application.  Ordering more.
1,"This is not XAPP Recovery as is listed, it is XAPP Energy. The difference is that XAPP Energy contains caffeine."
5,These are so delicious!! I usually don't like mint chocolate candies but my goodness! I fell in love! The chocolate will literally melt in your mouth. I gave some to my co workers and they kept asking for more! So these are my new favorite candy!
4,These bars taste a lot like Peter Paul Mounds candy or at least they do to me after quite awhile on the Atkins plan.  One warning is they are not that easy on the digestion so eat them slowly and don't be tempted to eat more than one!
3,Not quite as good as advertised.  The chocolate flavor has a chemical taste and the coconut seems a bit off.
2,"I was expecting a larger granual suger and am dissapointed in this product. I might as well have used normal grocery store ganular sugar (i.e., Domino).  Not worth returning and I would not buy again. It certainly doesn't fit my description of ""sanding"" sugar."
5,This was an addition to my sprinkles for Christmas cookies.  It was fun to use. Made my cutout cookies much prettier than I ever imagined.  No problem with item or seller!! Excellent!!
5,Very pleased. Expensive but worth the cost to me because of the beautiful soft luster it adds to my baked goods. Shaker and pour openings for easy application.  Ordering more.
1,I enjoyed these mints for many years... They are now terrible because of the changes that Wrigley has made to them.  Get rid of the color and put back the flavor.  I will not buy them again unless they are changed back.
1,"I fully agree with the last few reviews. Altoids were ruined when they started adding food coloring. Wintergreen Altoids are horrible now. These were the ONLY mints I would buy, but I won't be buying them any more.<br /><br />FAKE SUGAR, FAKE FLAVOR, FAKE COLOR = NO DEAL"
1,"I will not buy this product again. I cannot find the actual ingredients, Natural and other flavors are not sufficient for people with allergies. So far the peppermint is OK if I do not buy the minis. I may just stop buying Wrigley products in general when finding ingredient lists is this difficult."
5,Altoids are my favorite mint and this is the way to buy them to last for a while.  Save money and get them sent straight to my door.  Usually get 4 of the double boxes of 6 per box.  Definitely worth the savings.
5,"The Altoids Wintergreen mints are my favorite flavor of all time! Everybody always compliments me on how great my breath smells (I know it's kinda weird)! Anyways, I would absolutely recommend these mints!"
5,"I am very pleased with this product, the expiration dates are really good-I got a fresh product and in a very reasonable time.  I will order from your company all the time now.  Thank You for your very good service!  Sincerely, Dianne L. D'Andrea"
5,What can I say? They're curiously strong 8-) Nice to get the flavor I like in a multipack as they don't sell them here in Afghanistan.
5,"I have never found Altoids to be lacking.  Also bought the new licorice flavor.  It is really nice if you like licorice, and I do.<br /><br />Good price."
4,This is a great way to get your Altoids without hopeing you'll find the flavor you want in the check-out lane. Plus the price is very comprable. Plus the wait was short..
5,"I love Altoids. I can get the peppermint ones at my local COSTCO for a good price, but I get tired of peppermint after a while. Amazon is the easist way to get other flavors like wintergreen."
5,"Thanks for sending them.  The students and faculty at Davidson College in the Music Dept. will enjoy them.<br /><br />Bill Vinson<br />Davidson, NC"
5,They filled the order very quickly.  Thank you for including this product as eligible for free shipping.
5,"Product actually arrived sooner than I expected, and was properly packaged and in good condition."
1,i did not want this item and it was placed in my order by error and the item cannot be canceled.  This is unacceptable when I do not want the item.  How can this be taken off my bill?
5,"Morton and Basset granulated garlic is just hands down better. We've been using it for about 4 years now, and it's consistantly the best."
5,"Locally I was paying around $10 for it. The last time I bought two tins of it because the store owner said he wasn't able to get it anymore. As another other reviewer noted, this is a well kept secret, but one that is incredible if you can find it."
2,They refuse to ship this fine tea to Canada.  I have to go to the Middle East to find it and bring it back.
5,"These ends do a great job for the heavy chewer, safe and yummy. Unfortunately (sp) Amazon has these things listed all over the place so it is tuff to do a simple comment or price on the bone. $3.70 is right price ea. but buy the 10 pack cuz you get the really big bones in there."
4,My dog is a very picky dog.  So we did some research and this knuckle bone was suggested.  The dog has chewed on the bone randomly but has not shown much interest it.  The bone is very durable and looks as if it could last a long tim.
5,My dog is on a meat free diet due to severe food allergies. It seems to have very good quality ingredients and she loves it. It does seem to cause a very soft stool but hopefully it will firm up over time.
5,"This is the best tasting bar on the market! They only use good food, no junk! The flavor is just awesome! You cant go wrong with these bars!!!!!!!!!!!"
5,"It is my 7 yr old lab/basenji mix's favorite food, which we mix 1/3 can together with her dried food, making a single can last a week as a special treat.  However, after shipping, it is cheaper to go to my local pet store"
4,"Like other Merrick varieties, my dog also loves this brand as well. Ordering was easy and the turn-around time although it was initially quoted at 7-10 days, I received my items in 2 business days!  I saved even with shipping compared to my local retailer without having to haul it back to my home."
3,"When used right out of the can,and even mixed over dry food two of my dogs had loose stool. Right on the verge of being the runs. So I have too strain out the solids and get rid of most of the liquid. Even so they love the taste, too bad of the latter."
5,"With the cost of a frozen TUR-DUC-KEN being $69 plus almost $20 shipping, this canned alternative is really a bargain!<br /><br />Merrick Homestyle is clearly the classiest of the whole-meals-in-one-can products.  Bravo!"
3,"The batter seems to require more moisture than the instructions call for and they don't give a baking time, but 4 minutes seems to work about right. The waffles taste more like regular waffles than Belgian Waffles. I was hoping they would have a more ""malty"" flavor."
3,"Tastes good, but barely any protein. If you want protein, get Nutiva's unflavored 50% protein powder. You can flavor it yourself. It's cheaper and has more protein."
1,"Expensive, nasty and low in protein! I really don't understand how this product has got good reviews. I am not exagerating but the taste is nasty. I drunk it once and the rest I flushed through the toilet. Bad!"
5,"Just got this shake mix and tried it out this morning...Yummy!  Blended with frozen banana, a few strawberries and water it is filling and not too heavy.  It feels healthy even though it is chocolate it is perfect.  Can't wait to try the berry too."
5,I Love this product!! The shake is great mixed with vanilla almond milk it's AMAZING!!! I am going to be buying for the rest of my life and I will be buying it from Amazon. It's so much cheaper than anywhere else!!! Enjoy!!
4,This is a wonderful item! I add fruit and flaxseed when making the shake. Tastes great! I needed something that did not have the Soy in it. Soy is everywhere! Yuck. I love Hemp shakes now.<br />Very worth ordering. I will try the Berry when it becomes available.<br />Awesome!
1,The taste is less then desired. I ordered three canisters all together and can't return them. My suggestion to anyone that wants to try it is to order just one and see how they like.
4,The Nutiva hemp shakes have the best texture around for sure and that is appreciated! But the chocolate one doesn't taste like much of anything.  I expect a chocolate mix to taste like...chocolate. Mix it with chocolate Almond milk and it's really good!
5,"Instead of eating chocolate. I have this as a chocolate treat and it is really good. I blend it with Ice, ice milk, a banana and a little stevia, really good. People talk about having gastric distress I add some miralax powder in it and that adds the extra fiber to help digest this."
1,The taste is not real great and the protein level is really low.  I definitely prefer Amazing Grass Green Superfood Chocolate to this product.
5,My latest beverage addiction.  The only thing I don't like is that temporary noxious cloud that arises when you put it in water.
5,"This was ordered accidentally, but I accepted it anyway.  I (and my family) am very glad I did.  It was delicious.  I will definitely order this and other products from them again."
5,"I wanted to buy it from amazon.com as I was lazy to do shopping.  However, after comparied the price, retail stores are much cheaper than online."
5,"Our dogs love Pupperonis.  They are wheat-free, which is a necessity for us.  The big bag actually has bigger pupperonis, so that's the one we get."
5,"Best treacle toffee I have ever found and I have tried lots of toffee.  If it can be beaten, I would like to know about it!"
5,Walkers treacle toffees are the best treacle with most desirable chewing consistency and taste. This package was well priced and delivery was prompt. I wish there was a larger per pack amount available.
5,My daughter and I both loved this bread!  This was our first time trying it and I was a little hesitant but we both thought that it was delicious!
5,"The SANS Black Cherry Soda is the best tasting ""diet"" soda I have tried. The sweetener is the herb Stevia which is natural. With ""0"" calories and ""0"" sugar, it is a great refreshing drink."
2,This honey is good. But I can't understand why the price is changed so frequently. One month ago I bought it at Subscribe price 34USD. This time I bought it at Subscribe price 40.83USD. But now it is 39.86USD. From the price aspect I don't recommend it.
4,"Follow up purchae of a theraputic Honey. The larger quantity was what was required. Response and delivery were very good.  I do not have the knowledge to enter the ""Genuine ~ or Not"" debate. This product tastes fine and seems to have healthful properties. I am buying more."
3,"These are delicious crackers, but don't ship well, and many end up broken in the process."
5,this product was purchased for my husband who has been hooked on hot sauces for years and this is now his favorite.
5,"Heard about this hot sauce on the Larry Miller podcast. Ordered up a couple bottles and my first test was on a pulled chicken bbq sandwich. I knew after one bite that the bottles of tabasco, chilula, etc...are gonna be gathering dust. Seriously. Great flavor and perfect heat. Thanks Dexter."
5,Hot sauce is very good and shipping was fine I would reccomend this product to people not much else to say in reguards to the hot sauce
5,This is a great Hot sauce.  I wish it was available in grocery stores for purchase.  I recommend Gringo Bandito.
5,"I have tasted many hot sauces, but for me, this is perfect. It starts bright in flavor, then mellows to a smooth, spicy bite at the end. Not too hot though, just right. I have sent some to friends and will soon order more for myself."
5,"this sauce is perfect if you like spicy sauce...i use it on wings, hot dogs,, hamburgers and on other sandwiches and salads..."
5,I love this hot sauce!  Dexter Holland (of band The Offspring) really made a great hot sauce!  I def suggest getting a bottle or a few!
5,"unbelievable good taste - these anchovies are from outer space!!!! they are out of this world!!!!! tasty and delectable, with any meal - you cant go wrong with these - they are a fantastic gourmet item from the sea!  anchovies in general are great, but these far exceed anything i have tasted!"
5,"An amazing difference from the old canned anchovies! Try them, you'll never go back. Store in a plastic or glass container after opening and you're good to go for a long time, if they last that long!"
5,The price was too high but the product was just great... A possible touch-up to the price would make even better
5,I trust this brand--the flavors are blended just right and I love that many formulas include stevia--no need to add sweetener!
5,"My dogs love these treats and I have to say I dont blame them they smell soo good(dont worry I never tasted them) and I feel good in giving my ""babies"" healthy treats that are made in the US not china (hard to come by)Another good flavor is their pumpkin and apple."
5,"Eukanuba has created this specialized breed food for certain dogs and my Dachshunds have benefited from this food by having a healthy coat and weight. I order on line because there is no one who sells this specialized breed dog food in Alamosa, CO."
4,I have a dachsie mix and I don't want her to get fat as they are prone to do.  This is a good dog food and she likes it so as long as I don't over feed her we should be good to go!  the shipping was quick.  It tends to be pricey no matter where you find it.
5,It was so much easier to have the dog food shipped direct to me than have to carry it home from the store!!
5,Arrives always in about 4 days. It is more convenient and cheaper than the store. Recommended!! Great service too. My Dachshund love it!
5,"Yummy vanilla icing that you dip the pocky in. There's plenty of icing and this snack tastes soo yummy. It reminds me of my childhood favorite dunkaroos! The container looks small, but there's plenty of pocky and icing to satisfy you."
4,"I like spicy, my son does not so my wife cooks bland. I keep a jar on the dining table and add it as a condement. This is a lot, but I go through it quickly."
4,"I got the same product at my local grocery store for $9.99. Much cheaper - what's going on Amazon? You aren't even offering a bulk price. Great product, my dogs love them too, but can be found much cheaper elsewhere."
5,"My dog is a very fussy eater.  Getting her to eat everyday is a challenge.  But she loves these mini sized ""greenies"".  As soon as she hears me open the bag, she is patiently waiting for her treat."
5,"My dog loves this treat and is very aware whenever I go where it is stored.  I give this treat to him as an award after bathing, combing his long hair, etc."
5,"If you want to try something different, this is a very exotic and refreshing tea with with many benefits for the body! The box arrived intact."
3,"This bouquet was delivered to rural western Michigan about 50 hours after ordered. The heavy, clear, tall vase tapers toward the bottom. Yellow and white carnations were beautiful, but the roses died before opening.<br />The price couldn't be beat anywhere on line."
3,"Hot and Spicy cheeze-its are yummy, but they do have a bit of a funny aftertaste, so you will need a drink.  Also like the other reviewer said, they were smaller packages than advertised."
3,"I love the hot and spicy cheez-it<br />But was disappointed to find the packages were only 1.5oz instead of the 1.92oz that Amazon advertised them as. Dont know how they managed to flub it up, it states right on the box 1.5oz."
3,the plant is pretty but they didn't gave me what i ask for. i ask for this plant in this picture and the send me another one with a darker color. what is not good is that once you open it you can not send it back. and also it was very small one. and the orchid is fake.
3,gave it to a friend as a gift and she enjoyed using it in her baking
1,I tried to use these dried morels as a substitute for fresh morels in a chicken dish and they were lacking in flavor. Morels should perfume a dish and these mushrooms did nothing when rehydrated.
5,I don't really have much experience with dried morels.  I can only say that I was delivered exactly what I expected.
4,"I bought these to stock a meeting room at work and they have been a big hit. Once people realized they were sugar free they felt they could enjoy them without guilt. They taste good, not too sweet with a little tang."
5,These are very tasty and they will crunch without risking damage to any dental work or your teeth in general. A great way to limit sugar intake. I reordered because I liked them so much.
5,These jelly beans are very tasty... have good flavor and were delivered fresh. I would recommend them just to try a new jelly bean flavor.
1,Very disappointed in these nuts.  Horrible taste.  I got my money back and these went into the garbage.  Will not trust Azar again.  Same thing with the raw cashew pieces.  I thought they tasted toxic.
5,"I'm on my third bag of these, I've been using them for raw food prep.  They are consistently fresh and the price is great!"
3,Not as good as others that I've brought!~ Very Pricey and the bag does not seal that tight....I used a clip to keep it more air tight!~.......Not a fan!~
5,"Their macadamia nuts was great for baking.  Also compare to buying it in the store, this was a much better value.  Definitely would buy from again."
5,"Quite often macadamia nuts are salted. These, instead, are raw, natural, with nothing added: just delicious macadamia nuts, as they come out of their shell.<br />If you are a fan of macadamias, you have found the right seller!"
5,"Delicious and nutritious.  Very fresh, unsalted.  Love them.  Healthy raw nuts.  Good price."
1,"$59.99 for 6 boxes of 17.7 oz each ($10.00 / Item), plus $14 shipping? They have them in stores for about $5 - $6."
5,"Excellent rub for a good basic chicken.  Could have been more original, excellent, but not amazing."
5,This was a good buy.  Tried using it for lemon meringue and it was great.  Tried it with baked pumpkin custard and it was awful.  Mostly use it for cream pies which always turn out great.
4,This is a very mild Merlot. Extremely smooth chocolaty start with very slightly fruity middle. The finish is smooth but not as smooth as I'd like it. Lack's the richness I'm looking for in Merlot but really a great casual drink to enjoy with food.
5,This is very good and tastes great with strawberries.  It is just like having chocolate dipped strawberries without all the calories.
1,"Puzzled as to why this product doesn't live up to the claims? You're not the only one. There does not appear to be any evidence at all to support the claims made. One has to wonder if the testimonials are indeed genuine, given the lack of evidence."
5,These peanuts have a crispness and flavor it is remarkable. You can almost snap them. Their flavor is clean and sharp. I would highly recommend these peanuts to anyone that would like to taste what a great roasted peanut should be.
3,"These are way better than rancid grocery story peanuts, but they weren't as good or as fresh as I'd hoped. I imagine that they'd been stored too long at amazon before being shipped.<br /><br />Too bad, because if they're not going to be absolutely fresh, why would I buy these again?"
5,I've never had a better peanut.  Have ordered them twice and sent them as a gift.  Looking forward to trying their cashews.
5,Found these peanuts about 12 years ago when I lived in Virginia. Although I moved to SW United States I still order them on a regular basis. They use only the best nuts and cook them just right so they have the crunch and great flavor you expect from Virginia style peanuts.
5,These are absolutely the best peanuts ever! This was not my first time buying them. It most definetly won't be the last. They are huge and lightly salted. Very very flavorful.
5,"I had been buying Gourmet Virginia Salted Peanuts from another company and was quite satisfied, but I couldn't resist the price on these. They are every bit as good! Best nuts for the price."
5,"Switched to these from The Peanut Shop of Williamsburg's tins of salted peanuts (also currently available through Subscribe & Save) and these are MUCH better, plus a better value."
4,"The price was excellent, but we found Virginia Diner brand to be better.  These had a few lower quality peanuts in each can.  However, all Virginia peanuts are still better than any other kind.  Robert"
5,"Got these for my peanut lover for Christmas! Great taste, crunchy and great size! One can gone working on the other one!"
5,"The Royal Oak Virginia Salted Peanuts are great. I would highly recommend these<br />and will reorder from time to time. I bought two 2 packs, a total of 4 40 oz cans."
5,These are really good peanuts.  The best I have had.  They are fresh and delicious.  They are not too greasy and have just the right amount of salt.  I like them very much!
5,GREAT PRODUCT AND well worth the subscribe and save price. This is a great tasting and presentable product. Brand name and delivered as often as needed...who could ask for more?
5,BEST PEANUTS EVER!!!!!! Just the right amount of Salt and they are some of the largest peanuts on the market.
5,"These peanuts are super crunchy and fresh. I like that they only use 2 ingredients, peanuts and peanut oil, unlike most the nuts sold at major supermarkets. These'll last you a while."
5,"I have tried all brands of gourmet peanuts and these are by far the best peanuts.  In addition, they are a little bit cheaper than the leading competitor."
4,"I have tried Feridies, Royal Oak, and The Peanut Shop of Williamsburg brands of Virginia peanuts. These were a close second to Feridies. They have a great texture and are salted just right. If Feridies are out of stock, buy these peanuts from Royal Oak."
5,"I usually get Virginia Diner or Plantation Peanuts but decided to try these, I had some guests over and everyone loved them, they are excellent quality !!"
5,"Best peanuts I've ever found.  Big, crisp, addictive!  Just wish they were calorie free!"
5,"This tastes just like the iced tea you buy at Starbucks. I like it better because I make it with purified, filtered water. Great tea"
5,Tazo Zen is a great tasting green tea.  I would recommend to others at least to try.  They serve it at Starbuck's stores so it would be better to try there first (although they will charge you $2 for a small).
5,"If you love good quality tea, always buy the ""Full Leaf"" type.  You will enjoy it!  Zen, is my favorite!"
5,"as i expected its a great taste and healthy and good shipment packing great fair value, i will order it again ,thank u starbux"
5,"The tea is delicious...has a natural sweetness to it and has no caffeine. It is a bit pricey, but cheaper than buying it at Starbucks drive up."
5,"I love this tea. The flavor is heavenly and the tea bags look like a lovely sachet of poupourri, not a regular tea bag. It's such a pleasing statement, visually, aroma, and flavor. I've given this tea as gifts."
3,"This is a nice alternative for Tiramisu if you can't have any dairy, but it doesn't come close to the ""real thing.""  The flavor is similar to Tiramisu, but keep in mind that it is a ""cake,"" so the texture is nothing like the famous dessert."
5,"I purchased these for my picky eater. He totally loves them. He is a large dog but they gave him plenty of chew time. He is allergic to a lot of dog foods and treats. I was very glad to find these, he had no allergic reactions and really loved them. I just wish my local pet stores carried them."
5,"The Kirkland Signature bagged coffee's are Great. Each roast has its season and I've found that I like all three so I'm good all year around.  But buy from Costco they are now about $19.00 a bag.<br /><br />Rwandan, Guatemalan, & Sumatra all three are great!  Use with the AeroPress ;)"
5,"since Kirkland's New Guinea is not available, this seems closest  in quality.  Have waited for Kirkland to bring it back,  but am getting used to this great coffee"
5,We were very disappointed when Costco did'nt carry it anymore. When I found it on Amazon it really made our day. We were Starbucks fans for so long and when we took a chance on this Rwandan coffee it turned out to be better than Starbucks! GOOD STUFF!!!
5,"I don't understand.  I just bought this last week at Costco for $13.  Do they promote this coffee in different stores at different times of the year?  It's amazing, but it isn't worth anywhere near $40 or so dollars a bag!"
5,"This has got to be one of the best coffees I've ever had, sad thing is Costco no longer carries this product, while they did the cost was just over $13 per bag or just over $4 lb.  I'm sure gonna miss this coffee since I just cannot see paying $12 lb, time to find a new favorite."
4,"Stonewall products, although pricey, are very good. High quality products with high taste value. Vendor rated very high. Product arrived early, and well packaged."
5,"My dog loves these treats and with her sensitive stomach, there are no problems plus they keep her teeth in great condition."
5,These dried Bing cherries are absolutely delicious. I have used them with wild rice and toasted pecans for a side dish. I plan to use them with a roast pork tenderloin soon. Excellent quality and price.
4,"I didn't find any pits and that's saying something because whenever I buy cherries in the store, they always warn ""may contain pits"" and sure enough, I always find one.  These were good without a lot of sweetener, and also didn't have the preservative flavor."
2,"I love cherries ripe, jammed, dried, any way I can get them.  I've eaten lot of different kinds of dried fruit from different providers. These were stale and I ended up throwing them out."
5,It's a great oil to start oil pulling with. Very satisfied except shipping could've been cheaper
5,The advertising said 'this is the perfect sauce' and I'm not sure it's wrong.  Combined with a spicy home-made crust this can't be beat.
5,"I have used Pastorelli Pizza Sauce for many, many years and when we moved to Tennessee I wasn't able to get it so now order it by the case. Love it!"
5,"This sauce is one of the best I have tried.I have used jarred as well as packaged and book recipes.This sauce shines.I keep a case in my pantry,and because of 8oz size there is never any waste as the case with jars.Good Price-Premium sauce!"
5,Nice and thick the way pizza sauce should be - not a watery mess the way the rest of them are. Good stuff full of flavor.
5,"I had searched for years for a decaf coffee that kept the wonderful flavor of a full-bodied coffee. I finally found it when I tried the Newman's Own Decaf! Great taste, great company, happy customer!"
5,"Chocolate covered marzipan from Europe....<br />what more needs to be said, this is awesome<br />stuff.  Back in the olden days, like the 70's,<br />my aunt would always bring me this chocolate when<br />she would go Germany..so this chocolate also<br />brings back happy memories."
5,"Niederegger marzipan has lots of almonds in it. If you expect almond flavoring in it, this product is not for you."
2,Very disappointed with the taste of this product;it really lacks flavor.In the future i will wait until Schluckwerder Marzipan is back in stock.
4,These are delicious crackers which stay nice and crispy even in humid weather. Unfortunately this particular packaging seems very prone to breaking in transit. They still taste good but I think I will order them in the different packaging where they seem to transport better.
4,"Love the taste, but at least half of the crackers in every package were shattered."
5,"These crackers are crisp and delicious.  They are very crunchy and if you like crunchy like I do, then you will love these.  They go well with dip - my favorite is raspberry chipotle.  The teriyaki flavored ones are even better."
2,After opening the box it looking like it fell down a set of stairs.  Most of the crackers in the packages were cracked and full of crumbs.  My husband is gluten intolerant and he likes these crackers.  I guess we won't be ordering them this way again.  We are both very disappointed.
5,"The product arrived in excellent condition and was fresh.  The price was actually less than I have paid at Walmart and Target. Both of those stores seem to be very sporadic in carrying this product, so I was glad to find it online.  Very satisfied!"
5,"These crackers were exactly what I was searching for.  Tried them at a Christmas Expo and wanted to avoid the price being charged at the show.  Great with cheeses, salad, dips, etc.  Thanks!"
5,"My order was mis-shipped. I recieved the wrong flavor but Amazon was great, they replaced them with the correct item and told me to keep the mis-ship."
4,"While the crackers were awesome, they were not packed very well and many were broken."
4,These crackers/thins are so good and not particularly fattening.  They have some salt to them which makes them good.  Most stores don't carry them so I liked the idea of ordering a Pack of 12 via Amazon.com.<br /><br />Janet
5,"You will become addicted to it once you eat it, I promise.  Everyone of my friends agreed."
3,We like these crackers but the last two times we ordered them all the<br /><br />crackers were smashed.
5,This is a very tasty gourmet cracker! It has a taste of the sesame seeds and seasonings.  Most crackers are overwhelmed with a salty taste so you can't enjoy your dips or spreads but this is just perfect! I eat them without any kind of spreads or dips also!  Try some you will love it too!
5,We love these crackers!  They are fresher and crispier when purchased by the box.
5,These are our favorite snack crackers.  They are crisp and thin with a wonderful but subtle flavor that goes great with any topping.  We  ordered two cartons (24 packages) and they arrived in perfect condition with very few broken unlike many we have purchased locally.
5,"Our daycare uses this formula as the default (if you don't provide your own), which is what promted us to try it out. Our daughter (although she can't talk to tell us for sure) likes it. We've tried all the name brands and this is the only one that doesn't seem to upset her stomach!"
5,I have a subscription for these to get a case (50 cans) every 2 months. The fish are fair sized with 5 to a can. The only complaint I have is that the scales sometimes detract. It says packed in oil but it is really an oil/water broth. I pop the can and pour it down the sink. Recommended.
5,"I was glad these arrived quickly but sadly, they were gone just as quickly. I will order more soon."
5,"I like the VIA Colombia instant coffee. It's medium but still a little dark for me, so I make two cups of coffee with one pack... :)<br />Very good deal from Amazon compare to the price in store.<br />I'll but this product again."
5,"These were great, we used them at my daughter's wedding (they are her favorite).  They were nice and fresh.  Thanks"
5,"these are the best mint chocolate candies. i would keep this at my work desk and a pack of 240 ct will be over in under 2 weeks, everyone would just stop by and grab a few."
5,Candy was fresh and a good value.  If you are looking for bulk of this product this is a good way to go.  Though I see the price has really gone up since I ordered them.  No more free shipping?
5,awesome product at a great price - high quality human grade allergy friendly cookies!  dogs love em!
5,"My dogs love them....In fact, these are safe (stomach wise) treats which keep my pets happy after coming home from a walk or going into their crate.  They like them almost as much as cheese!"
5,"These are the best biscuits ever. My dog demands them three times a day. She likes all the flavors, but sweet potato is her very favorite."
5,"I needed these Juniper berries fora Sauerbraten recipe.  Couldn't find them in any store, so was pleased to find them here.  Very pleased with transaction.  Will be back!"
3,"The supplier emailed me to check whether I wanted green or black berries which I thought was an impressive followup. The berries arrived in a plastic bag when I was expecting a glass container as per the advertising pitcure. However, all in all I was happy with the service and the product."
5,These juniper berries were exactly what I needed to cook a few German and Danish dishes.  I was happy to find these online since the local grocery store doesn't carry them.
4,Good price on these and they seem to be of good quality.  I can only give it 4 stars since there is some debris in each bag that has to be filtered out before use.
5,These are the greatest things in the world.  At the prices on Amazon you can't loose.  Definatly a good buy.
5,"This is, hands down, my favorite Haribo candy.  It has a wonderful strawberry flavor and the sweetness is not overpowering."
5,"cant find these anywhere else.. LOVE THEM!!!! do wish they would come in a smaller size, 5 lbs is alot!"
4,"We used to live in Bonn and would go to the store right by the factory.  The gummies sent by Amazon are good, but they are not the same as the ones that you get when you are in Germany.  Haribo produces these in Spain and then import them to the US."
5,"When I opened the bag it was like smelling fresh strawberries!  I'm not big into sweets, but these are just right and don't taste like artificial flavoring.  Haribo definitely makes the best gummy candies!!!"
2,"Be cautioned, do not order these in the summer.  No protection was taken to protect these from the summer heat, so I received a 5 lb bag of gummy goo!  The entire bag was liquid when I received it."
3,"I received my 5lb bag of gummi's on time. They are good, but not the same gummi's you find in Germany. They look like it from the site. After I already ordered them I read another review that state's the same thing. I guess I need to fly to Germany for the real thing."
5,Super transaction.  I ordered these for my father in law's birthday.  He was so thrilled.  They were really fresh and tasted amazing. Thanks.
5,"These gummy strawberries are YUMMY and very flavorful. We are big fans of Haribo, give these a try you will love them."
5,These are really great tasting and oh so cute.  They were perfect for my daughters birthday party!!  Strawberry Shortcake.
5,I still haven't eaten all of these. It takes a while to go through five pounds of gummies :)
5,This is the best price I have found for Haribo.  The candies are fresh and the texture is just right.  Great buy!
2,"Bought this candy to try it as a fill in snack. Not a fan of gummi stuff. So, that was my mistake. But, the strawberry flavor is ok. The bag is gigantic. So it's good if you have a lot of kids to eat them. They advertise a five pound bag, they're not kidding."
1,"Not tasty... and almost impossible to chew at all! Items are pretty, but seriously, have no taste and are like chewing rubber."
1,"I have purchased these gummi candies in the past and not had a problem, but these strawberries tasted terrible and I ended throwing them out."
4,"Better texture and flavor than most. Machine made gnocchi will never approach handmade, sort of like boxed mashed potatoes vs homemade, but these are about as good as possible. Try boiling and then baking with gorgonzola and cream."
5,"My co-worker, who is from Hawaii, introduced me to this delicious dressing.  I add it to my salad and somen noodles, and I have a quick Asian noodle salad.  I have served this salad to my many friends, and it always get rave reviews.  It is, by far, my favorite dressing."
5,"I have been using this for years.  My local supermarket used to carry the dressing, and then stopped.  So ... I had to resort to ordering it online."
4,"Item was yummy.  Didn't realize it had MSG haha but who am I kidding, the product is delicious!  Mix 2 spoonfuls of this special sauce with cut up firm tofu and green onions, voila!"
5,"My grandkids live out of town so this was a perfect gift that they could all share and enjoy.  And what's better, as a kid, to receive a package in the mail?!"
4,"I am writing this on behalf of my dog, who enjoys this product.  He's a fairly strong chewer, this is a sizable bone for 40 lb dog and it keeps him occupied.  So far have had no issues w/ splintering or chipping.  Would buy again."
5,These cookies are difficult to find in my local store.  I received several packages of cookies.  They came to my door without any of them broken which impressed me because that seldom happens when I purchase them at the store.
2,Some of the cookies were crumbled.  I also found out that these cookies routinely sell for $2.50 each at walgreens.  Paying more that $4 per for some crubled cookie did not go well.  I will not be purchasing this items again.
5,"These are delicious cookies. what can I say, except that they're crisp with a brown buttery flavor.  They're versatile, as they make great cheesecake crusts.  I'm still playing around with creating different recipes, but I need to hide them.  Otherwise, my family eats them like potato chips."
5,"I first ate these in Ireland. This pub I went to included them with cappuccino. It was perfect. Crunchy, sweet with a distinct flavor like caramel and cinnamon.  If you have no self-control, I do not recommend buying these ""biscuits""."
5,"The cookies are really good, unlike many airlines' offering(if any). The cookies were well packed, none were broken and were a good value. I have subsequently found them at a national store."
4,These are wonderful cookies but if you care about appearance a few on the end are always cracked-up pretty good.
5,So good. I can't get enough of them... I always ask for more on a plane ride. They taste amazing.
5,"There is nothing better then good coffee at a good price, well flavored, great taste, even better out of my Red Soxs mugs, also a Amazon purchase.  Great deal from warehouse."
5,"We got Mexican Nesquik because it was cheaper, but I was surprised when it actually tasted different and better than the US version.  It has a darker chocolate taste which I really like."
5,this is as good as it gets for great cornbread.  tastes like home made.  will order again
5,Made with things that are good for you it is also a tasty brew. I drink it before bedtime and it actually helps me sleep better!
3,I was disappointed... I expected the filling made from fresh apricots.<br />And this one is made of DRIED apricots. Very big difference. I think the seller should make it clear what the product is.
5,"Loved this.Got it for a gift,but i tried some too.Really gives you a decent sample of some space ice cream.I really enjoyed this,and will order more in the future!!!!!"
5,We loved the astronaut icecream .the other items in the sample pack were ...interesting and worth trying .but the icecream is awesome!
4,"This is such a unique item, we all wanted a piece at Christmas. my 2 year old nephew all the way up to my 52 year old dad. You don't see it every where so it was fun to have!"
5,This makes for an exciting gift for any child.  It opens the door for learning about the space program.  It would be great in conjunction with a trip to Kennedy Space Center and is cheaper than the astronaut food that they sell in the giftshops there.
5,I bought this for my nephew for christmas and though I haven't given it to him yet I know he's going to love it; any boy would (can't speak for girls though I'm sure they would like it too). I love freeze dried ice cream myself and the space camp theme is great.
5,Great price! I'm amazed at the hard to assemble collection of Space Food.<br />They taste great for all occasions. You don't need to be camping or on a Russian Soyuz rocket.
5,I sent a box to my son who is stationed in Kabul Afghanistan.  He was thrilled to get it and really enjoyed it. He shared some with his fellow soldiers and now they want more!!
1,All of the items listed on the description were not included in the box.  I was missing at least 4 food items.
2,"First off let me say I am a foodie. The 2 ""energy"" bars tasted terrible. Of course the other 3 ice cream products are delicious. But for almost $17.00 it is not worth it. Oh and the magnet is just a advertisement and didn't stick to the fridge."
1,I ordered this because the title says ice cream and food sticks...I received all ice cream. I don't have time to mess with a return. Change the title if it's assorted ice cream.
4,"This is my 2nd order from them, my 1st was the italian roast espresso which was pretty good. I like the french roast a bit more as it does not have any of the charred taste that the espresso did. It's oily and very aromatic, brews wonderfully in my french press & I recommend!"
3,"Not a bad coffee but defiantly isn't as good as others. The Dark Brazilian is better in my opinion and the Italian Roast Espresso is the best of the Coffee Bean Direct line, if you love dark roast coffees."
2,"I usually drink French Roast, either Peet's or the Costco variety. This coffee had a distinctive burnt taste, much more pronounced than Peet's. It is drikable, but certainly not in the same league. Will not return, but will only use in latte's, where the taste is mitigated by the milk"
5,"This is an excellent product, i bought it after the price of 2% parmalat doubled in price, guess the skim is better for me anyway. Living in the country and not having immediate access to grocery stores having shelf stable milk is a life saver. I keep at least one in the refrigerator at all times."
4,"These bones are awesome!  My dogs love them - it's great.<br /><br />I purchased these for $22, and went back to buy some more and now they are $32 which is a huge increase in price.  I don't understand why there was this big increase?  I don't really want to buy them anymore."
5,"This is a lot of Fenugreek. We got it to make fenugreek compresses, which help reduce swelling and promote healing"
1,These seeds would not sprout.  I had to return them since I bought them to sprout.  This was a hassle since I had to try to sprout them 2 times to assure it was the seeds and not my mistake.
3,"While I may find other uses for these seeds I wanted them for sprouts. I soaked a couple tablespoons for 24 hours in my sprouter, rinsed twice daily, but after a week still only a few seeds have sprouted."
4,This made my milk production go way up! The taste is strong but with some honey it is great. It will make you smell like maple syrup so don't freak out. My husband actually kind of liked it!
5,Sprouts after soaking for one night and waiting about two days. Seems good quality. First time buying fenugreek seeds. Resealable bag.
5,I used JCS Oxtail & Stew Seasoning as part of my cooking routine. The flavors blended well with my stew and vegetables to give it a unique bold flavor. I would recommend this seasoning as a woman's spice essential.
5,"I have tried many brands of coffee and I always come back to Melitta.  This coffee is the best they have made....not too dark, not too light...simply perfect!"
5,We enjoyed this coffee and would recommend it to others.  The coffee came pre-ground so there was no need for bean grinding.  I would say this is a medium blend coffee without any bitterness.  It would appeal to a variety of people as we certainly enjoyed it.
4,"Moderately flavorful with no trace of bitterness. Low acidity, nice aroma. I had to use significantly more per pot than the package specifies, but that is usually the case with my Cuisinart drip coffee maker."
5,Recently tried the Melitta Cafe Collection Classique for the first time.  Unbelievable!  It's going to be hard to drink anything else in the future
4,"I only purchased this because it was offered to me free through Vine. I usually buy Starbucks whole bean coffee and grind it myself. I was very surprised at how good this coffee was, even though it was already ground. It is strong and rich and fresh. I'd definitely buy this again!"
3,"I like strong coffee.  I like starbucks.  I wanted to like this coffee, but found it not strong enough, even when I tried to double up on the brew strength.  Still, for a weaker tasting coffee, it was good."
5,"This is by far, one of my favorite Melitta coffees of the Cafe` collection. It brews perfect every time. It's robust without being bitter. If you like a good cup of coffee this is a winner."
4,"No disappointments with this coffee. I have always been fond of Melitta coffee and this lived up to their great reputation, although a bit pricey."
3,I enjoyed this coffee for it's smooth flavor that wasn't extremely strong. It's definitely better than most brands you find in the grocery store. I would recommend this to someone interested in a solid cup of coffee.
3,This coffee was just so-so; nothing to write home about. I honestly couldn't distinguish it from one of the generic canister brands at the local grocery store.
4,This coffee hasa full - Robust flavor that is great alone or with a meal!
4,"I usually use fresh ground beans so my expectations were low.  I was quite pleasantly surprised.  This is a rich, flavorful coffee blend, without tasting processed or bitter.  Best of all, it is the perfect grind for a Melitta pot and that makes a big difference."
3,The coffee was ok. Not as strong as we normally like so I had to use a little more grounds but the flavor was ok then. The bag was one of those re-open bag but it would not open and when it finally did it tore a huge gash down the side. -1 star for each. Don't know if I will purchase again.
4,"The coffee was mellow with a little bite to the finish. Compares favorably to most coffees out there with just a tad more harshness. I found the packaging ridiculously difficult to open - finally taking a scissors to it. The description says ""Pack of 3"" but I only received 1. Overall a good coffee."
4,"I enjoyed this coffee! It's got a rather bold flavor and is a little sweeter than most coffees, but that's what made it a stand out for me. If you're looking to try something new, then give this flavorful and hearty blend a try!"
5,I was really surprised about how good this coffee is.  I normally buy a Starbucks or Dunkin Donuts bag at the grocery store but his is right up there in quality and the price is a little better.  The coffee itself is very fresh and has a strong black nutty flavor that I really like.  Enjoy:)
4,"Does have the claimed European flavor -- seemingly between French and Italian.  Better than Folgers, but not as good as premium brands.  A bit weak.  I needed to use more coffee than I usually do to get a strong enough brew.  Not bad, but I'll pass and go with a premium brand."
4,"This is a very nice, ""European""-type coffee. It has a very smooth flavor, almost akin to that of chocolate. The quality is high,and it is packed in a Vacu-Pack bag, very good for the preservation of freshness in this high-end coffee. Recommended."
1,My husband and I tried this coffee in place of our favorite Dunkin Donuts one day and we had to throw out the pot. It was too bitter to drink! We definitely do not recommend this coffee.
5,"We love having fun with the Gold Flakes.  Guests chuckle and ohh and ahh over having gold shaken into their cocktals.<br /><br />The Edible Gold Flakes also make the ultimate hostess gift.<br /><br />Thanks to the seller, the gold always arrives quickly."
5,"My kids & I love these, they are like rice krispie treats but not as sweet, similar texture and a great snack."
5,"I saw this on Dr Oz about keeping blood glucose steady throughout the night if you take 2 teaspoon fulls before bedtime.  It really does work!!!!  It has a really strong almond taste to it that I don't fancy, but thats what it is.  I can get over that for what I bought it for :)"
1,When I bought this I was hoping it would be like peanut butter but almond flavor.  Its not close.  I suppose if you can't eat peanuts this might be an alternative but I would look at other nut butters.
5,"My doctor suggested I switch from peanut butter to almond butter since I eat so much of it and it is healthier. I spread it on apples, bananas and even my pancakes! Good stuff!"
5,love this stuff although it's not HOT enough so I'll be seeking a more concentrate product. I'm sure that there's some hotter cinnamon oil out there.
5,"My cat loves these! When I take the container out, she get super excited and eats every last flake I give her. She's a very picky eater, and I've never seen her so happy with a treat before."
2,"Neither of our cats was the least bit impressed with this product. The flakes did arrive as scheduled, but remain unused except for small amounts that were presented to the cats in various ways in hopes that they would find the flakes appealing. No joy."
5,"This is about the 5th type of Xylitol sweetener I have tried.  I threw away most of the previous one.  So when I received this ""Ideal"" I was skeptical...well...it is delicious!  No off-taste, just wonderful."
3,"Stupid me - didn't read the label before buying.  I thought this would be pure xylitol, but later noticed they've added Dextrose with Maltodextrin and sucralose (Splenda) for extra sweetness.  I don't know what proportion of this product is xylitol."
5,"Finally found a non-sugar sweetener that my family likes, no complaints.  I've read that xylitol is not harmful, may actually have benefits (keep away from dogs though) so it's a winner so far."
4,"I know many people say a lot of artificial sweeteners taste like sugar and don't, but this does.  If you sprinkle a little in your hand and taste it, it's amazing how much it taste just like sugar.  Would of given it 5 stars if more sugar came in the box for the same price."
5,"Great product. First no calorie sweetner that tastes like real sugar. Works great for baking. We are two diabetics and I bake cakes, including cheese cake, banana bread, pies and cookies. Can't tell the difference. Love it in my tea too."
5,"Originally tried this because it was on sale, and I figured that even if it was gross I'd only be out a buck. Happily it tastes great, mainly have used it in coffee and tea. Just ordered my second box."
5,I love this stuff as I drink it everyday with my coffee. I previously used stevia but it seems to leave a nasty aftertaste which is why I love Ideal. It tastes great. Im a pre-diabetic but I've fooled my tastebuds into believing this is sugar.
5,"This is the best so far, no after taste and taste just like real sugar,I have several people using this product now and I am ordering more. I am giving out some of the packets and they really like it."
4,I like this because 1packet sweetens 4cups of coffee to my liking. the pack seems like it almost has nothing in it. I was mad when i took one out of the box but they deliver an acceptable result when you actually use them. to me one packet compares with 2tsps of sugar.
1,"I tried it, but I just didn't like it.  Not a good tasting sugar substitute in my opinion.  I'd rather do without sugar than use this again."
2,"These crackers are great.  Unfortunately, every box I've bought is about 50% broken.  And that's from several different stores."
5,"Delicious crispy crackers with a wonderful taste of sea salt & olive oil.  I've tried other brands, but this is the best."
2,"keebler townhouse olive oil crackers taste OK but are a waste of money when 80% of minicrackers are broken into 1"" pieces"
5,All of the eggs fit together fine and stayed together.  Worked great.  Great value for what you get.  Colors were nice.
5,"Got this in a K Cup sampler, definitely on my reorder list.  Very smooth, no bitter after taste, dark coffee.  So far one of the best, tied with Caribou Mahogany.  If you like good strong coffee with out the bitter after taste, this K Cup is perfect."
5,"Absolutely the best French Roast k-cup I've had so far.  Rich, bold and satisfying.  A little pricey but worth it."
5,This is one of the best K cups out there. Nice bold flavor.No bitter after taste. If you want a bold K cup try this!
5,This is my favorite of all of the bold coffees. No bitterness at all. Just very smooth and delicious. I was very surprised to see that it is a product of Green Mountain.
4,This is by far the best K-cup coffee I have tasted. Has a big bold taste with lots of flavor. Unfortunately the price is too high so will only buy on special occasions.
3,"Not bad, and perfectly drinkable, but bland with no liqueur. Not as bitter as some Columbians I have had, but that, unfortunately, goes back to the 'bland' bit."
1,This coffee was substituted for a coffee I had ordered in a coffee club. It was $4.00 more than what I usually get and like. It was bitter(harsh) and strong. I thought it was terrible. Quit the coffee club and would not order this again.
4,"It's too bitter (read: over-roasted), but a pinch of salt calms it down nicely, and it does have a good full flavor which, again, would be more noticeable if it weren't so burnt."
3,I was glad to get the 3 boxes of Starbucks Coffee and it was ok. It may have been around for awhile as the coffee was good but didn't taste Fresh.
5,This is by far my favorite morning and go-to k-cup.  Great richness and body.  Not weak at all even though it is described as a medium blend.
5,"Canned mushrooms produced in the USA are hard to find these days (many are products of China).  Organic canned mushrooms can also be quite hard to find.  In this product you have all that, and they are very good to boot!"
5,"I am very happy with this brand, they are plump & juicy big slices from the whole mushroom, not just a bunch of stems & pieces. And the icing on the cake is that they're organic & sold at a good price."
1,"The labeling on this product is deceptive, I recently purchased this item in the store thinking when it says Pennsylvania Dutch and Americas Favorite Mushroom I was buying food produced in the US only to get it home and find it was a product of China.  How sad that a company would try to do this."
5,"These are great, if you can't find organic at your local store. I buy them on a regular basis. Mushrooms have some great health benifits. Look it up!"
5,"I have always used Giorgio Mushrooms, one cause they were a product of the USA!  I ordered the organic ones for the first time & they are just as good!  Will continue buying Giorgio's products!"
4,This brand is only 95 cents per can at my local grocery store ($11.40 for 12).  Canned mushrooms are convenient and the product is good so I gave it 4 stars.
5,They are great. I love them and eat them every day. They are less expensive at the grocery store than online.
5,"This product is great if you are looking for low carb... I do what is says on the package add some sauce and vegetables, and you have a great dinner... It actually tastes good toooo. I would buy this again.."
5,They came fast and the bags are in good shape.  You really have to be sure to wash and dry these several times. I just put a simple tomato sauce on it and it didn't taste bad at all. But you have to wash them very good and then heat them with what ever sauce you are going to use.
3,These are alright.  Def. have to rinse them the odor is not pleasant.  The texture is strange a little chewy. They are filling and need to be spiced up with something.  Not sure if I will buy again.
5,These noodles are best when used in stir fry or with an Alfredo sauce. Tried them as spaghetti and I'm sorry to say they were not good.
1,"These look like noodles, but after that there is no comparing this product to pasta.  The texture is rubbery and there is no flavor.  If you love pasta, you will not love this product."
5,"I am very impressed with these noodles. I microwaved them straight from the bag, without rinsing, served with some pasta sauce and Chicken Parmesan and WOW, very good!! I did not notice any odor.  If you are on a diet, I would give them a try at 20 calories, why not! They don't even need cooked."
1,My girls hated it.  They gagged as soon as they smelled it....and so did I!  So gross!!  Like dog food but worse.
3,The cats do not seem to like the Ham baby food as well and the Turkey baby food or the Chicken baby food.  The kittens seem to feel the same way. = They really slurp down the turkey.
5,"There were several different flavors of truffles in the box and they were all great. If you like chocolate truffles, you are going to love this box of candy."
5,"I grew up eating this wonderful candy, in my book there is no better. A bit pricey but well worth it. When I eat Sees Truffles my tummy giggles :-) Thanks Amazon for making this product available. You are my one stop shop these days. Fantastic candy fast delivery"
5,"If you're looking for bargain basement chocolates this isn't for you.  But if you want to try a taste you'll never forget and probably buy more, as I did, you can't go wrong.  This is simply the best I've ever had, bar none.  It's expensive, so's an Acura, but both are worth it."
5,"See's, in my opinion, makes absolutely the best chocolate in the United States. I sure wish they would make it eligible for Amazon Prime. I'd get a subscription for 2lbs a month lol."
5,"My daughter moved to a new home in Washington state from San Diego, California. The grandkids loved the housewarming gift."
5,See's candy is delicious. There were shops in California where I grew up.  Now I live in New England and there is no other way to get it except mail order. I'll take it! ;)
1,See's makes delicious chocolates; close to the best; but their chipping charges make each purchase a total rip off. I think that every one should boycott See's for that reason.
5,My cat has kidney problems and has to take three pills twice a day.  It was undoable and gag-inducing until Pill Pockets.  Now he begs for them.  Astounding and miraculous!  Thank you for making these!
4,"Pill pockets are about the only thing I can get my dog to take her medicine in. I would suggest the larger capsules to save money. If you want to only use half or less of a pill pocket, they easily mash together or come apart to make any size."
5,"Our dog now requires twice a day pills and the Greenies Pill Pockets are the easiest and most convient way to accomplish these tasks.  No more scrap of cheese or lunch meat.  Also like the fact that you can pull them apart into smaller ""pockets"" based on the need."
5,"My dog loves these. It is the only way to give a pill to dogs, no fight, no mess and dog gets the full dose of pill because he thinks he is getting a treat."
5,"My dogs love these and it is very, very easy to get them to take pills using these.  They now look forward to getting pills and don't spit them out.  Just don't let them learn to chew them or they may figure out the pill is inside (i.e. keep feeding them little tidbits after the Pill Pocket)."
5,I purchased 6 packages of Greenies pill pockets to donate to my local shelter. I selected the items off of the Amazon wish list.  I also had them delivered directly to the shelter. They arrived 2 days after I ordered them. Thanks
5,"I could coat a pill in pure hamburger and my dog could figure out how to eat only the burger and somehow the pill ends up in the floor, I swear she chokes it bak up! Not with these! She begs for it now! And eats the whole thing one bite!"
5,I have to give my dog six pills twice a day. He loves it. No more hunting for baloney or cheese and it's better for him.
3,My doggies give me a hard time when I have to give them a pill. These work especially when I give them fish oil for their coats. I split the pockets as they are too expensive to use on a daily basis.  They love the flavor. They do not like cheese - go figure??
5,"My dog has to take medication every day.  I use the pill pockets to get some of the medications down, and he absolutely loves them.  He just thinks he's getting another yummy treat!  I highly recommend them."
5,My boxer needed antibiotics for 8 weeks. He loves them. He thinks they are treat and does not notice the medication inside. Also they are a great cost saver online.
5,"My dog has caught on to every way I've tried to give him his meds and stops eating the disguise.  If he knows the meds are in these treats, he doesn't care.  Easiest way to dispense meds to dogs!"
5,Pill pockets are great! My dogs love them. They are soft so perfectly hides the pill medication we give them.
5,My dog ha s Epilepsy and requires morning medication and evening medication.  4 are capsules.  Works great. I would reccommend this product to any one.
5,We own a boarding kennel and often have dogs that need a pill pocket to take their meds - some won't eat the beef flavor but are willing to take the chicken flavor.  Great way to convince a dog to take their medications!
5,Love these. My Corgi is very stubborn and will not open his mouth for a pill...but he thinks these are<br />a treat. I couldn't find chicken at my Vets and my dog is alergic to beef.
5,Our dog has the ability to find and spit out the pill despite our hiding them in favorite foods. Greenies Pill Pockets have solved the problem.
5,I bought the greenies pill pockets beef and chicken flavor. My dog needs medication and these are great to put the meds into. My dog loves these.
5,I have lived with the hardest dog in the world to give a pill to for 14 years (Lab mix).  Pill Pockets make all the difference in getting her the meds she takes on a daily basis.  Worth the money!
5,Perfect for pills and capsules for medications for the dog and the dog do not hesitate to take all her medicines.
5,Both of my dogs take medication on a daily basis and without these pill pockets it would be the biggest hassle ever!!!
5,This is the easiest way to give your dog medicine. My dog prefers the chicken treats and she comes running everyday to take her meds. Terrific idea and I am only sorry I didn't know about it years ago.
5,This product makes giving medication a breeze.  Just pop the pill in the center and squeeze shut.  My dog thinks it is a treat.  I love them!
5,"My dogs love these. the pills go down easy, the dog dosen't know the pill is in there. They beg fot these as treats long after the pills are gone."
5,Fantastic product. I use both the Chicken and the Beef flavor and both are great. It is the only way I can get my dog to take pills. These definitely work well!
3,The pockets work good for holding the pills (i have several) but some of them fell apart - to help prevent it i put them into the refridgerator! Delivery was fast and effective.
5,This product makes medicine dosing oh so easy.  Our big ol' chocolate Lab would sell her soul for a Greenies Pill Pocket.
4,"Like the taste and assortment of these, sadly they arrived in the same box as 12 cans and didn't like it very much!! 0/10 to the packing dept."
3,"I gave it a try because of the promotional discount.  The cookies were overpriced and arrived a little crumbled, but were good nonetheless."
5,I had never heard of Walker's biscuits before and I was really surprised how good they were.  The ginger cookies had pieces of ginger in them - delicious and the chocolate biscuits were different and tasted great.  The honey oat biscuits were also very good.  I would like to order them separately.
5,"I love this tea. I make it strong and mix it with a splash of lemonade.  I copied a similar tea from Starbucks.  I like mine better, plus...it costs less!"
5,This product is wonderful.  Drizzle it on your pizza.  Mediocre to magnificent in mere moments!
5,"i am a cook and this is a special ingredient in one of our most popular salads. it really goes well on a variety of dishes, butthe arugula salad it just makes it have the special kick."
5,"These bottles are very tiny, but man, do they pack quite the taste!!  This is the very best white truffle oil I've ever had!  It's pricey for it's size but you won't regret it.  Try it on popcorn with a sprinkle of himalayan salt, omg, YUM!"
5,"This was a nice mild Truffle oil. Usually pay more at Whole Foods or high end grocery store. This was a good quality and tastes great over potatoes and grilled vegetables. Quick Ship, happy with purchase."
5,I use this on anything that I want to have the scent of truffles on and it never fails.<br />I've finished a bottle and order two more. Thumbs up!
5,Thisis excelant value truffle oil and I am very happy with it for summer use on pasta and bread.
2,Was disappointed with this oil.  Not much flavor and had to use a lot to make up for the lack of taste.
1,I guess my palate is not as sophisticated as I had thought. I'm a rather adventurous diner but this truffle oil really cashed me out. I tried it on scallops and pretty near had to trash them. I have no idea what amuses people about truffle oil. I gave mine away (ananomously).
5,"I bought these trays because I was originally using plastic ice cube trays and they kept breaking everytime I would take the food out. These trays work wonderful! They slide right out and are the perfect portion size! Love them! A little expensive, but worth every penny!"
5,We recieved our first freezer tray as a gift and I loved them so much that I bought another! We also use the bpa free oxo ice cube trays when we want smaller cubes! Having the two sizes is very helpful!
3,this freezer tray is not airtight --- so the puree will get freezer burn. I've had to enclose the tray in a plastic freezer bag before storing. I would expect it to work better for the price. However it is very easy to pop-out when ready to defrost.
5,I received this freezer tray along with the Beaba foodmaker and spoons from my in-laws.  I am totally told on all Beaba products due to the high quality and great designs.  The food pops out easily and leaves no waste behind.
5,"Such a perfect companion to the Babycook! I freeze in this and once the food is frozen, I take them out and put in a labeled ziploc because the lid doesn't quite seal tight enough for my comfort but would definitely purchase again!"
5,"We bought two from Williams Sonoma.  I loved them so much that when I saw them listed on Amazon, I bought another one.  They are perfect for making baby food and for freezing small portions of often used items like tomato paste.  I also froze 1 Tbsp portions to use when I cook.  Love this product!"
3,if you freez baby food this is for you!!! very easy to get it out!!!! Gets the job done. Be careful washing it in the dishwasher the plastic top can change its form and after does not cover well.
5,I love this product! I make all my own baby food and this makes the perfect portion size.  A bit pricy but worth it.
4,"I've been making food for my 7.5 month daugher. so far, I haven't made enough bulk to fill up this food saver. And when she does eat, the amounts she's eating wouldn't even be half of the little serving size that is in this container. I cna't wait to use it when she's a bit older and eating more"
5,Love this freezer tray.  I set it on the counter for approx. 2 minutes and then can easily pop out whatever food I have frozen in the cups.  I love that it comes with its own lid.
5,"These freezer trays are expensive, but worth the money without a doubt.  They are the perfect size for freezing individual baby food portions, and the frozen food pops out easily when you want to transfer it to ziplock bags.  Great product!"
5,"The Beaba Multiportion Freezer Tray is perfect for freezing baby food.  I made my own baby food for my two children, and this is a simple way of getting it done quick and easy.  Plus, it is easy to push the frozen portions out after freezing because the tray is flexible."
5,"They make freezing and storing food super easy! Perfect portions, they stack on top of each other and food pops out of the soft shell with ease. Have them in every color! Worth every penny."
5,I bought two of those to freeze food for my baby and they are great.  The food pops out pretty easily.  I wish they were a little cheaper though.
5,This freezer tray has nice proportions.  I bought it for a friend who uses it for her food and the baby's.  She thinks it's easy to use and clean and uses it for various foods and juice pops.
5,The Beaba Multiportion Freezer Tray - Pink was exactly what I expected and more. This is a great item! I love it.
5,"its more expensive than the rest but let me tell you....great quality, easy to clean, to use and works great cuz i have the meals ready to go....WELL PRESERVED"
5,"Actually started using this for big ice cubes, but gave it to my daughter for her baby.  Works great.  Love the top."
5,"This freezer tray is excellent - I am actually purchasing another - now that the little one is eating more food,<br />I'd like to prepare more at once. Frozen items scoop out easily with a spoon. Easy to clean!"
5,We have a friend that recommended this to us.  She makes her own baby food and freezes it in this tray for use later.  We will give it a whirl when our baby arrives.  It seems like a well made product.  It looks like it is good for BIG Jello-shots too!
3,"The lid merely sits on the top, and is a huge pain to get on and off, especially since we use this to freeze milk. Half the time it spills everywhere while I'm moving it to the freezer. Sooo annoying but at least the bottom is silicon. It will be useful for baby food and less-liquid things."
5,"Love this freezer tray. great portion size, easy to use, dishwasher safe, and bpa free for baby. would purchase again (I actually wish I had a few more!)"
5,"I am just so in love with these trays!  I now have four!!!  I have used them for baby food and have even whipped up a batch of pesto and frozen it.  Once your food is frozen, they literally just pop right out!  I couldn't be happier with these!"
4,I bought this as a gift. The person who received it really likes the product
3,Came to me with a chipped lid.  I wrote an email to the company to see what I could do and no one responded.
1,"Unfortunately, Made in China. I do not trust their manufacturing standards.  Looking for an alternative...."
1,This listing sells the freezer tray for nearly $50 when all other retailers sell for 19.95. Make sure you look before you buy.
5,"I wasn't sure what these consisted of when I ordered them,but I was very pleased w/the taste & the texture... Very sweet w/a kind of sugary marshmallow texture :)"
5,Have started sprouting again and am enjoying these seeds.  I use them in my salads and sandwiches.  They add a good crunch and help with a flavor bite.  The amount of radish seeds seem to give the right spice to the mixture.
5,Tasty mix of sprouts.  Easy to grow.  I keep them in the freezer and expect this bag to last a very long time.
5,the mix came quickly and was very sproutable.  i have lots of seeds to sprout for a long while.  it's great.
5,"delicious mix, fast shipping, i weighed it when i got it and it was ever so slightly over a pound, so i'll buy again!"
5,I'm new to sprouts. I bought these and have been adding them to my salads and I'm enjoying them a lot.
5,"I've just gotten back into sprouting again. This is the best seed product I've used yet.  The seeds sprout quickly, are all fertile and produce great sprouts.  Highly recommend."
5,They grow well in my sprouter and the taste great. Sometimes I just eat them plain.
5,These sprouts tasted great together and my family loves them too! We put it on our salad and sandwiches.
5,I love this mix. It's not too strong but you know it's in your juice. The germination rate is really high as well. I feel like I received an excellent buy for the money. I would come back again to purchase this product.
2,"The seeds sprout well, it is true, but there is a bitter taste to this mixture. I use them on sandwiches and I thought there was something wrong with the non-fat mayo. Plain alfalfa sprouts taste much better."
5,"We use the seeds sparingly to grow sprouts to use on sandwiches, salads, etc.  Easy to grow, and the variety of seeds adds a punch to the flavors.  I highly recommend this product for ease of use and taste."
5,Good quality seeds......a pound goes a long way.<br />Nice combination of seeds.<br />This combination does have a flavor zing. I don't know if its a radish or broccoli seeds that add the spicy flavor.<br />Very tasty.
5,"Really nice mix of seeds, and a good value. So convenient not having to drive to the health food store for seeds!"
5,I love these sprouts - not only are they healthy but they are tasty as well.
3,"This was spicier than what I usually prefer.  Good change of pace in my salads, but I prefer the Broccoli sprouts."
5,"Not only are the seeds great, but the customer service is the best I've experienced in my over 10 years of on line shopping.<br /><br />In my opinion 5 stars are not enough!"
5,"This was a great mix for micro greening or sprouting. I used them mostly for micro greens as I have ADHD and almost always kill off my sprouts. This mix tasted great in everything I made; salads, sandwhiches, quiche, stir fry, shakes, anything."
5,"I am so grateful to be able to obtain this organic seed combination and grow my own sprouts for daily consumption.  I use them as almost a full salad and not as ""dressing"" for a salad of lettuce, spinach."
5,Sprout seed mix arrived very promptly and in great condition.  I needed them for our local farmers market and will be ordering more very soon.
4,"Good sprouting yield and great price.  Sprouts are a little bitter, don't know if it is the broccoli part that is causing the sprouts to be bitter."
4,"good price, makes for nice sprouts, wish it were just a tad been stronger with the radish, I love the spicy bite.  shipment was fast, thanks!"
5,"I have been sprouting Alfalfa seeds for years.  I thought I would try this mix and was pleasantly surprised.  The radish gives it just enough of a bite to be interesting, but not overwhelming."
5,"We really like these spicy little sprouts, which give a salad a nice kick! They're ready to eat in 3-4 days. This blend is a good value, especially since they're organic. They shipped quickly as well."
5,This was my first time sprouting and it was a great experience. My seeds were starting to sprout within 24 hours and mostly all sprouted by the second day. Quite a tasty mix too! I enjoy a salad with just sprouts more than a lettuce salad.
3,"This mix was OK and the price is reasonable, but there are a lot of unusable seeds in the bag that do not sprout - I'd say about 25%."
5,Put these sprouts on a sandwich and it becomes a gourmet meal. They last a long time in the fridge too. I am a customer for life. I just wish they made a bigger quantity to buy.
5,Love these sprouting seeds.  The mixture adds a tangy interest to the sprouts.<br />Great in salads and on sandwiches.  We live in a remote area with limited access to fresh produce.  These sprouting seeds add freshness to our sandwiches and salads.
5,"These lowfat Frosted Strawberry ones taste just as good as the others, I honestly can't tell the difference."
4,They were probably really good. The ants thought so anyway. The ants got to them before we could. I do not know if the ants got there from wherever they were shipped or from sitting on my porch.
5,This was a gift for someone that loves pop tarts thanks so much he was so pleased and I know they will last for a while.
5,"I absolutely love poptarts even though they aren't the healthies breakfasts, I buy the low fat version and save half the fat of the regular version and I think they taste better, they are crispier when toasted.  The price is also right on amazon.com."
5,"I like pop-tarts, and a pack of 12 is a convenient way to house them."
4,My first time having soda flavored candy. It breaks into a powder on the first bite and really does taste like the Ramune soda. It is also fun to find the ones that have little faces on them.
3,"Crunchy.  Came packaged well.  If you are thinking they are going to be like FunYuns, you would be wrong.  They are VERY mild flavored.  They are ok, but nothing I would crave for sure."
4,"Tried this with 40% off since Nong Shim instant noodle is my favorite, my ten year old son like it very much, I would like this with the stronger flavor."
5,it's my favorite snack. Amazon has the best price ever for this.<br /><br />cheaper than korean grocery website and korean market.<br /><br />I'm gonna order again
5,Not heavy on taste...low fat and 0 trans fat.  Everyone loves these...trying to buy more but Amazon is out of stock!!!! OMG
1,"I hate to say this, but this snack is terrible. No onion flavor what-so-ever.  All it does is gum up your teeth."
2,"Don't waste your money on these.  These are practically flavorless, yet still feel a little greasy in your mouth.  Yuck.<br /><br />If you're looking for some great onion-flavored snacks, just buy the Alexia Onion Strips.  They're light years ahead of these.  Seriously."
5,"Frankly, I have no idea if this really cleans the dog's teeth.  But, our excitable dog can become a nuisance when company comes.  By the time he finishes one of these large treats, he has calmed down."
5,"My dog loves these dental treats.  I had no idea dogs like peppermint, so was hesitant to purchase at first.  Now I'm a repeat customer.  I alternate these with Greenies dental treats for variety.  Make sure to have plenty of fresh water handy since the peppermint seems to make the dog thirsty."
5,"These are great dental treats and have the VOHC seal of approval, which helps me believe they are truly effective."
3,"The product is great, but the shipping was alot. I want to order it again, but I won't because of the shipping."
5,I can't recommend this company enough.  I always receive my Pepsie's within two days.  The price is far less than I pay for it here. Plus I get it delivered to my door.
1,"I paid $15 for Kit Kat 4pk 70% Cocoa Dark Chocolate and received ONE pack, not four. When I queried the company, they ignored me. Unless you are comfortable paying $15 for a small candy bar, I would avoid these guys."
5,"Although a bit hard for my cat to chew at first, she loves them now and can't wait to get her treats!"
5,"The tea is what it was advertised as! The tea tin and packaging were also in excellent condition. The tea tastes nice, just like normal english breakfast. They are non string tea bags, round instead. Lovely for a gift!"
5,"I used to eat this all the time when I was a kid but unfortunately, they stopped producing it for a while. Then suddenly, its back again. I love it! Its really, really tasty :)"
1,"This noodle is not made in Japan, is from Hong Kong, the price in supermarket is about 0,45$ each. Please be a honest seller!!!!"
4,"Lovely oil, great for pasta, grains, bread. Wish I had bought white oil, I like that better.Very comprable to what I bought in Italy in the local store."
5,"Good quality, I found it at a good price. My wife loves to cook and it is one of her favorites tricks for giving excellent flavor to the meals. I highly recomend it.<a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001E5DQGU"">Urbani Black Winter Truffle Infused Oil, Bottle, 55-ml Bottles (Pack of 2)</a>"
3,"Great value for an infused truffle oil, however I enjoy the White Oil better for basically the same price.  I'm sure I'll use it all up and then just order that one instead next time.  They're both good.  Love it in mushroom quiche or garlic mashed  potatoes!"
5,"The smell alone will make you salivate, it is that good. It comes with rock sugar mixed in, so I don't ever use any added sweeteners."
5,"Love the ginger ale! Best ever. Took a bit to get it but it was worth the wait.However, my credit card was comprimised when I ordered from Amazon. I probably won't order from them again."
5,We have been waiting for Earl Grey Decaf and now it is here.  My wife love it.  She now can drink either Earl Grey or English Breakfast.  It gives her a choice.<br /><br />The Earl Grey is not as strong as the English Breakfast.
5,Love this product.  The tea is smooth yet hearty which is tough to find in a decaf tea.  Perfect!  Highly recommend.
5,"It is so nice to have this tea in a decaffeinated k-cup.  It keeps all its flavor and is a warm, delicious, comforting brew to have on hand.  It is great with milk and a little bit of sugar!"
4,"This Earl Grey Tea has a zing to it, that I didn't have with a different brand.  My husband likes the zing, I am not sure about it.  It's worth trying, if you want a black tea that isn't real strong."
5,"I love this tea, especially in the K-cup!  The flavor is delicate; the citrus note from the bergamot sets it apart from regular black tea.  And there is none of the mess I experience with tea bags!  I bought this to make my mother-in-law happy, but this has become my favorite evening drink."
3,"The tea was OK but had an odd ""flowery"" after-taste. I like teas that are more ""pungent"" so this one was not totally my preference - but, as I said, OK."
5,"Refreshing taste love the decaf, because I can have some before bed, still resting well, quick delivery. Twining's is a good brand, it doesn't taste like your drinking tea dust in the bags"
5,I like Earl Grey tea as a change from black tea or green tea.  It has a very pleasant scent and taste to it that I find very relaxing.
5,A distinctive decaf tea is hard to find.  I want a black tea taste but have rebuffed other decaf teas because they are flat and have weak flavors.  Early Grey decaffeniated has enough flavor and no flat taste residue.  I drink it at night to unwind and have no worries that I will be up all night!
5,this is a very good earl grey tea and i would recommend it to anyone who enjoys a quality tea
5,This tea is a wonderfully tasting tea.  It has a great aroma and lifts the spirits!  The price was good as well.
5,You can't beat the convenience and the tea is strong enough you can get a double volume on one keurig cup.
5,tea has excellent flavor. it is a little expensive but very convenient and great when you don't want to wait for the kettle.
5,Getting 2 boxes of the Classic Twinings Earl Grey decaf k-cups for such a low price is awesome.  Love the taste of Earl Grey and the convenience of k-cups and autoship.
5,strong flavored tea the way I like it. I already went through one box in a couple months since I don't use the machine as much as I would like to.
5,Bought this product when I was having a problem and had to give up coffee.  I like it so well that I use it all the time now<br />mitchell880
5,Makes a great iced tea.  Make it and chill it and pour it over ice later on.  Works great!
5,"This stuff is great. I just had to give it a good rating. I didn't know if I'd like this, but my fianc&eacute;e suggested we get this instead of the other tea varieties and that was a good call."
3,"Strong oil smell is nice, but the flavor is a bit bland. I prefer the Bigelow. And no, I don't work for Bigelow. :)"
5,"Great price for a great tea.  To have the ability to enjoy my decaffeinated tea with the convenience of my Keurig is one of life's greatest pleasures.  Each cup is fresh with all the Bergamot I enjoy from a full brew.  Dont' be fooled by the decaf, this truly is a full bodied Earl Grey."
5,I'm not a fan of boiling water for 1 cup of tea nor am I a fan of green tea.  This tastes good and is not bitter. It's convenient and can be flavored and savored in under a minute.
4,"This tea was fine...just not my favorite.  I prefer flavored herbal teas, but tried this for regular tea.  It has an unusual flavor, but I do like it for something different."
5,I'm a big earl gray fan and I loved the deal and taste of this tea!  Will definitely keep my subscribe and save order  on this tea and recommend it.
5,"This tea is not only decaf, but tastes wonderful.  Has a real smooth taste.  Relaxes me and if my tummy is upset, helps.  I love this tea."
4,"Got this tea quickly,and have enjoyed it. I love Earl Grey tea, and it is so easy with the Keurig."
5,I have a hard time finding Earl Grey tea cups in the stores...they sell English Breakfast...but I really prefer Earl Grey...this was the best price I found...
5,Wasn't sure I'd really care for this tea - as a k-cup option.  It's WONDERFUL! It's the perfect blend of tea and all you have to do is brew it in a minute. Add a touch of honey and sit and relax while the tea warms you up!
5,"Recently removed caffeine from my diet I thought life was over, until I found these Twinnings Earl Grey Decaffeinated K-Cups. The flavor is great, convenience is awesome and the value is much better than I have found anywhere else."
3,"I thought it was caffeinated. I was wrong. It put me out of energy for 20 days. Never again. BUT, the taste is good. A little strong though"
5,THIS IS FOR MY SUNTS FOR CHRISTMAS THEY LOVE THIS KIND OF TEA AND NOW THAT IT IS K-CUPS THEY ARE EVEN HAPPIER.
3,"Love Twinings Earl Grey in regular form, thought this would be a good choice for a cup of tea or 2 in the evening.  To be honest decaf tea is rarely satisfying, and this is the best of the options available.  Sorry Twinings, I love you I really do, its not you its me...decaf is not my cup of tea."
3,"This is at best an average tea. It's not bad, just not great. I'd give it a 7 out of 10. I tend to think the Keurig, while a great coffee maker, is not the best tea brewer."
3,"I loved the Celestial Seasonings Earl Grey Decaf, but apparently it's discontinued and this has replaced it.  I don't like this nearly as much as the Celestial Seasonings.  Bah!  I feel betrayed."
1,"This is the first K-cup and Tea product from Twinings that no one enjoyed in our family. If I could have returned it, I would have after the first cup, but this item is not returnable."
2,Was led to believe that this product was individual tea bags not loose tea which requires special brewing equipment and now I'm stuck with product I can't move.  Chef Joseph
1,"Great for eating straight out of the box, not great for recipes requiring melted chocolate. Does not melt well, tends to dry out."
5,"Shared it with some Navy folk, and i got a lot of requests for more. Still one of my fave treats."
5,"Light. Crispy. Chocolate!  I had the hardest time finding these delicious cookies, but finally an Amazon vendor got some in and I ordered right away. The airy wafers are coated in milk chocolate without being weighed down by it. Yum."
4,"Please see my other review for more details (vanilla Halvah).<br /><br />This is a confection bar with fine-ground sesame seeds with pistachios mixed in.<br /><br />If you like sesame, and pistachio, you will probably like Halvah."
4,This chocolate is the best thing ever - made my dad really happy to get a shipment of these for Father's Day
5,"Wal-Mart sells this product. Tried to find on internet what grocery store carried it, found none. It was a freak accident when i saw it in Wal-Mart $2.96 for large container!!!!"
5,"I have used Cavender's for about 25 years, more or less, and this salt free MSG free is as good as the original. It has a great smell and tastes delicious. We don't miss the salt at all. I can't get this in my stores yet but I am happy I can order it through my faithful Amazon."
5,I have used Cavender's for years. It tastes great on meat and veggies. I haven't found anything I can't season with it
5,This has become my favorite seasoning. I try to cook without salt and this is an excellent substitute. It is not over-heavy with oregano as most greek spice mixtures are. I use it every day. I just ordered two more online to replenish my supply!
1,The Salt free version has a very acidic taste that melts when in contact with your mouth.<br />Just my two cents ...
5,"This is a must-have for Buffalo chicken wings. Most of the seasonings on the market have salt as the first ingredient. If not, no taste. Cavendar's is a staple in our pantry."
4,Cavender's All pupose salt free Greek Seasonings are great.  I use them for meat rubs and in recipies.  It's a very good product.
5,"This is the best stuff!  I use it on everything.  Steaks, fish, casseroles, and just like salt and Pepper.  It has a great flavor and without all the salt."
5,"It is difficult to find gluten free food that tastes good. This granola is exceptional! It is very tasty, with sweet cranberries and crunchy cashew nuts. Price is on a high end unfortunately."
5,"with celiac disease, i have problems with travelling and finding appropriate breakfast foods.  love this granola and it is perfect with yogurt.  just wish i could get it in a large box rather than individual packets for home use.  thanks gluten freeda!"
5,I order the plum bonsai tree and it was packed good the tree came happy and is growing beautiful I'm very satisfied I will buy more bonsai trees from this company.
5,great not the cheap kind - i bought the 6.5 gallon one<br />and has tons of caramel on the popcorn unlike cheaper products - brush brush brush LOL<br />taste and look fresh
5,"These arrived intact and not melted.  I was happy with the product and the price, and Amazon's quick delivery.  These and the peanut butter eggs are my favorite because they seem to have more peanut butter than the regular PB cups."
5,"Ordered these for my mom, they came quickly, and she loved their peanut butter filled taste.  Arrived in great shape."
1,"Fed to dog and she got violently sick and vomited the whole this up after eating it. Don't buy this product if you love your pet!!<a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000ANO3N2"">Nylabone Healthy Edibles Bone, Roast Beef Flavored with Vitamins, Regular Size, Triple Pack</a>"
4,"... but it's gone in 60 seconds :-).  Considering the cost of the bone and how fast it disappears I will only be buying intermittently,"
1,"Our black lab devoured this thing in 10 minutes, and at $6 a pop, that's way too much money for a dog treat.  Don't bother getting this."
4,"My dog chewed it up & made it disappear in about 5 minutes, while I was emptying the box. He definitely likes it but its a little costly to go so fast."
5,The product was exactly as described.  Wolf is Healthy Edible's code for large.  I do wish that this vendor would sell more than 9 units of this item at a time.
1,"I do NOT recommend these.  My six month old Golden Retriever, who is not a strong chewer, devoured this in less than five minutes.  It is a very expensive treat and I'm just hoping we don't have to pay a vet bill on top of the price of the Edible Nylabone.  I will never buy these again!!!"
5,Good reviews and my Maltese loves it!  We buy and switch up all the flavors.  I usually mix with their dry small bites (also very good).
5,"These cordials are very hard to find, so I was so excited to find them online, that I ordered 3 bags and have been enjoying them ever since."
5,fabulous and very tasty item.  I imeeditaley stuffed a dozen with chopped lamb and rice and seasonings.  let them sit in a pickling brine over night...<br />absolutely fantastic...<br />yummu
5,"My cat, Mango, just loves this cat food.  It is the only brand of food that he will eat on a daily basis.  I have also purchased Fussie Cat brand ""Tuna with Salmon"" from Amazon.com and he loves this food also.  I try to alternate the food on a daily basis to give him variety."
5,"My cat loves almost all the ""Fussie Cat"" flavors, and the this one most of all. He's very picky, so I'm pleased to find something he'll eat reliably. It also seems to be of good quality and is quite reasonably priced."
5,This is the best product for the best price esp without shipping.  Strictly uses products made in USA so it is safe for my pup.  Will buy again!!
5,"this is the closest thing to  going  to norway..great taste, fresh and very satisfying ( if you appreciate pickled herring)..far better than anything available in your local supermarket.."
5,"I'm not a huge fan of flavored tea, but the Raspberry Black Tea K-cups are great! My Keurig machine has an iced-tea option, so maybe that is why I am satisfied with my brew each time. I can also use 1 K-cup twice. The second one is weaker, of course, but it's still has a great flavor."
1,"I was excited to purchase this tea and found out thats its not good.  I brewed it on small setting and big, very weak, not of quality.  I have one of the Raspberry and one lemon I have to figure out how to get rid of."
5,Just got these in today and opened up 2 of the packages to put them in the cookie jar. They were not any broken and they are delicious. So full of chocolate chips!!!! I recommend these to anyone to get. They came to me in a large box with other things I ordered and they were in great shape.
5,I received these recently without any problem at all with the shipping. All cookies arrived intact and the taste is excellent. They are soooooo goood!!! They can be addicting.
4,"Unlike some of the other reviewers, my cookies arrived in tact!  In fact, out of the 4 containers less than 6 cookies were broken.  The cookies were delightful.  So good in fact that these will be the cookie of choice for Santa this year.  So go grab a glass of milk and indulge in these cookies."
4,These were very good cookies. I loved the texture and flavor. a nice surprise from a packaged cookie. I would buy again.
2,"Received product, which I purchased from Amazon.  Not a single cookie survived transit.  Nothing but crumbs.  Simply not worth getting from Amazon unless they do a better shipping job.  I would stay away from anything that is fragile at least in the sense of foods and groceries."
5,"I enjoyed the cookies very much - in fact, I saw them on sale at the grocery store and bought more.  Good stuff."
4,"Overall, a very good brand of store-bought cookiees. Nothing beats fresh homemade cookies, of course, but if you don't have the time, these cookies are actually pretty tasty."
2,well it was nice that they showed up early but they were all broken into itty bitty pieces. i didnt order pieces of cookies i ordered whole cookies.
4,"Keebler Chips Deluxe Coconut,18-Ounce Packages  (Pack of 4)<br />The cookies are great but someone in Amazon's shipping department took a pack for themselves!  I only received 7 packs but paid for eight.  The package had not been tampered with.  The shame!"
5,I searched and searched for a tea that tastes like the tea I get at my favorite Japanese restaurant and I was so happy to discover this brand.  I have turned several friends onto it also.  What I also appreciate is how affordable it is.  Sip and enjoy!
5,This is my favorite tea. Regular green tea tastes a little bitter to me. The addition of the brown rice gives this tea a nice smokey flavor. In the winter I drink at least two cups a day...I can't get enough!
5,"I love this tea.  I can drink it all day long, and I find it very comforting and satisfying.  It is especially pleasant on a cool or stormy day."
5,The first time I tried this tea in the Japanese restaurant and fell in love to it.<br />It is my favorite tea.... I love it!
5,I drink a lot of tea and this was a nice tea for a change. Lightly flavored and quite tasty.
5,One of my favorite teas!  Shipping was great and very fast!  I could drink this tea all day long...And to think it is also so good for you.  Too  bad it is not available at nearby stores.
5,Ive been looking for this brown rice tea like forever! I just can't seem to find this in the groceries so i didn't hesitate getting one when i found out it was on amazon. thank goodness! it's so YUMMY! it feels like I'm in Japan
5,The Genmai Cha tea I purchased is quite wonderful.  It takes a few cups to get hooked on its delightful flavor but then it's terrific to start off a day with. I use honey and sometimes a bit of cream which adds to its richness.  I recommend it highly to tea enthusiasts.
5,"At my local market, they sell this fragrant, nutty, excellent tea for $1.99 a box! $4.99 a box is highway robbery! Shop around!"
5,"Great prices on this product!<br /><br />Prompt shipping and everything was as it should be.<br /><br />This is one of the lowest calorie dressings I have found, and I was very excited to be able to buy it in bulk and save money.<br /><br />Plus the delivery to my house is great!"
3,"It is not real macha.<br />I'm kinda disappointed with that.<br />I expect that is green, but actually it is dark."
5,I really like this snack.  It goes well with tea. Not too many calories and good flavor (a little spicy and a little sweet).
3,it was ok i thought it would be tastier i probably won't buy it again. it was very bland and didnt satisfy my taste buds
4,We often have a bag of this sitting around at work for snacking. Really a contrast from other snack foods.
5,"I bought these on a whim and I have to say, worth it.<br />These are so tasty I have to keep them in stock. My new favorite comfort snack. Goes great with beer."
5,"This is perhaps my favorite of all the Haldiram flavors. I don't eat spicy or too hot foods, and this has the perfect sweet and salt taste. Good as a snack or appetizer."
5,"this is very good! I've used GNC products in the past, but I like this one because they have more and different flavors and it leaves me much more full than the GNC stuff. I will buy this from now on."
5,"40g of protein, great nutrition, minimal sugar and fat, and excellent flavor.  What more can you ask for in a protein shake?  I've tried many other shakes and I always come back to Labrada Lean Body."
5,"I drink one of these everyday. The strawberries and cream RTD is probably my favorite, which cookies and cream being second. These are perfect for when you are out and can't get some sort of healthy snack."
1,"Can't drink this, have an allergy to BOTH Dairy & Soy Products!<br />Make it a true dairy and soy free product then i could buy and consume it!"
5,I am very impressed with these country ham slices. A very high quality prooduct greatly exceeds standard racecar driver ham slices from the supermarket. Great flavor not too salty or too sweet.
5,"This tea is very tasty. I drink one cup of hot tea in the morning and at night, with a little honey and equal. Makes me very relaxed and calm."
5,"First found this marmalade at an Irish trade show. Loved it then, love it now."
5,This is really good with a rich and intense lemon flavor. I did not want to use alone as much as I wanted to use for a base for a dressing or glaze (ala recipes seen on cooking channel). I am well satisfied.
5,Very quick in getting my order to me.  Would order from them again
5,I love this seasoning for my chicken. So easy to make too! Great stuff!!!
5,This soup makes the greatest Pampered Chef Mediterranean Salad Dressing!
5,I love it. It makes a great cream sauce as well. I use it on chicken or to season potatos and there are never left overs! its great!
5,"This is a great product, very fresh and all meat, thank you for such a healthy food for cats who need so much more protein than dogs, no grain fillers-- cats love it!"
5,"It looks like actual, human-grade food when you open the can. You can feed this to your cat with confidence.  My hard-to-please, anorexic cat really loved this food; I wish we'd found it sooner."
5,"I love this in the morning.  Gives you some get up and go without caffeine, although it does taste good when added to coffee.  Best way to mix is to add to a little bit of water until fully disolved, then fill the cup up."
5,I am soon having bariatric surgery and have been trying many high protein supplements as I prepare for a new eating regimend.  This hot chocolate tastes great!  I would never guess that it is a protein product if someone gave it to me without my knowing what it is.
3,"I like the convience of the McDougall soups.  This is not my favorite.  It seems to need bread with.  I use these soups for work.  Most of them are very filling and taste great.  This one taste really good.  But, I seem to be a little hungry."
2,"I am always looking for good tasting vegan products.  Although I enjoy other Dr. McDougall soups, I didn't care much for the White Bean & Pasta soup. I would not buy it again."
5,I doubt this is something you are going to routinely fix at home (unless your a no-cook bachelor).  This is however tastey and great to keep in the desk drawer for those busy days when you can't break for lunch (Or forgot it like I do).
4,"I like this soup very much.  The only other McDougall soup I've tried is the Lentil Couscous which is OK.  This one is much better IMO.  At only 170 calories, it's surprisingly filling.  I eat it with a salad and really enjoy it."
4,This white bean and pasta soup has a lot of vegetable pieces that I enjoy. Being low in sodium and still remaining vegan is very important to me. Make sure that you follow the directions about letting it sit for a few minutes. Otherwise the beans will not soften up.
5,"our little family of three are all super health nuts, even my 4th grader. When she comes home from school and wants something warm in her stomach, she will just fix a Dr. McDougalls soup for herself. This is a great product for a quick wholesome meal."
5,I love this soup. I have it for lunch & it's helped me lose weight. Just keep it covered and heating ay least 5 extra minutes than it says on package directions or the pasta & carrots won't be cooked enough.
4,Flavorful and super healthy.  I highly recommend following the instructions.  If you deviate from them in the slightest way you will paint the inside of your microwave with this stuff.
5,I love this soup but like alot of these Dr. McDougall's soups you have to watch them when cooking and cut time off the full and 20% power.I also recondmend you let it sit for 5 minutes to soften beans up before cooking or after cooking with a 30 second 50% power after the soften time for heat.
3,"There's nothing really wrong with this soup. It's a little bland, and there isn't enough there to make it a meal. It would be okay for an afternoon snack, though. The beans and pasta DO soften up fine, if you follow the directions."
5,"We buy several flavors of McDougall's soups for winter outdoor activities. These are absolutely the greatest. They taste great, easy to carry in a backpack, no meat or dairy (vegan) and are ready in about 5 min after adding hot water.<br /><br />Perfect for skiing!!!"
4,"I like just about all the Dr. McDougall foods. The taste of this one if pretty mild, but good.<br /><br />I have a hard time getting the pasta to fully cook, and usually have to add more water and cook longer than indicated on the package."
2,This was just okay.  There are better choices like the Black Bean or Split Pea
5,i've tried every flavor of these mcdougall soups now and i really like them all.  they're the perfect eat-at-your-desk quick lunch!
5,I sent this to a friend who needs lower sodium items.  Arrived right on time and she says it is very good.  She is pleased and so am I.<br /><br />Virginia Aucoin
1,Purchased these for first time.  No second time.  The beans will not soften up nor will the pasta.
5,"I use the lemon and orange in a lot of things; esp iced tea. And orange in rice, oatmeal, other things to cut calories. One drop and delish!"
4,"I use lemon zest in a lot of my baking recipes.  I like to add a little bit of this lemon oil, in addition to lemon zest.  My results yield a heartier dose of lemon flavor, that taste completely natural-- which it is!"
5,I really like this cocoa butter. It makes excellent chocolates! I would definately order again. Good quality. Shipped quickly. Very happy overall.
2,Very pretty to drop a few rose buds in a cup of tea but found it to have disappointedly weak rose flavor as a tea itself.<br />Perhaps the other rose teas I've had were infused with flavoring. Not sure.
5,"Outstanding cheese with some personality.  Grates well for pasta, potatoes, omelettes.  Wine - while fine with some Spanish (and other) reds, this cheese is especially tasty with a peary Sauv Blanc."
5,"THIS IS ""GREEN GOLD""; I DISCOVERED IT WHILE LIVING IN CALIFORNIA AND ALWAYS KEPT IT IN THE KITCHEN; IT'S NOT SOLD DOWN HERE IN THE SOUTH THAT I KNOW OF; IT'S TASTY ON SO MANY FOODS; IT'S NOT ONE OF THOSE DELICIOUS GUILTY FOODS EITHER."
5,"I used to buy this in the grocery store, but it looks like I'll be going online for it from now on.  This is the best taco sauce out there.  Even the La Victoria Red Mild doesn't compare."
4,"My dogs are use to chicken jerky. They were apprehensive at 1st. I kept the buffalo put away for awhile, now they seem to love it. Go figure? Anyway it last longer than chicken jerky. I give them both alternataly. No jerky made in China, be careful of that."
2,I got my nestle nestum cerelac and my product was open one of the can was open. I would like to no if there is an reimburse.
5,"Great flavors and crunchiness.  Sometimes gluten free food can be bland, but these are really flavorful.  This is also a great buy if you compare only buying one bag of these to the variety that you get."
5,"Tea tastes wonderful! No weird ""fishy"" smell, or ""muddy"" taste like some have said about other suppliers. Individually wrapped 100 tea bags.<br /><br />Shipping: Product came fast and in great condition."
5,This is the second time I have ordered this tea. It has a wonderful flavor and very smooth.<br />I drink two cups every morning instead of coffee now. I was drawn to this product because<br />of Dr. OZ.
5,"The flavor is different,and a little 'earthy' for us, but we brew it together with another tea which works well.  This is a good value."
5,"Great product and it came EARLY!!!! I wasn't sure I was going to get this product or even like it, but it has a great taste & it came early!"
5,Exactly as I remembered as a child (50 years ago) and my mother and great nephew love this candy. I didn't have to wait long to receive the mints (8 pounds). great purchase.<br />thanks
5,These are hard to find flavor..My husband loves these....rec'd order fast & product was perfect....2nd time ordering and will continue ...My husband eats these like candy....don't know if thats good or bad... but I do know he loves them and his breath always smells great !
5,"I like my tic tacs powerfully flavored and the cherry passion pack has two terrifically intense flavors.  The wild cherry are wonderful and the passion fruit are delicious, making this combination wonderfully delicious."
5,i keep a empty crystal lite see through container filled with tic tacs in my car i choose several different flavors and mix them up
5,Excellent service!  Excellent Price!  Excellent Product!  I can't keep the dog off the phone telling her friends how much she is enjoying her Best Buddy Treats!  I have a very happy dog!
5,My dog loves the treats!!! I have a yorkie and they are just the right size for him. I let a friend give her dog some and they loved them also.
5,I was introduced to Taj Mahal by an Indian women who used it as the base for a wonderfully flavored chai using mostly ginger and cardamom.  I have been a fan ever since.  It is strong - only for strong black tea drinkers.
5,"I recently purchased a large box of Taj Mahal tea through Amazon.com. The order was promptly shipped and received, was fresh, and met my expectations. Taj Mahal is a superior import tea from India and I highly recommend it."
5,"Indian tea with a delicious aroma and intense flavor. a brand that I have met often in India and which I had pleasant memories . often i prepare the variant "" chai masala "" with fresh milk , cardamom , cinnamon , fresh ginger root and sugar. warmly recommended ."
5,"I had to cook a few small batches to get them just right,  but I love the fresher, less salty taste. I do recommend putting the package in a ziplok bag since they exude fat."
5,These are a great source of protein and healthy alternative to potato chips. Will buy again. Nothing in this world taste like a warm fresh pork rind.
5,"Purchased the individual microwave packs from another Amazon suoolier. They were great! Thought I'd try this brand since it was less expensive. I feel that these are just as tasty,have more flexability with serving size, and are a better value."
2,"The pork rinds cooked up fairly well in the microwave, but the smell was less than appetizing and the taste was fair at best."
5,These pellets really popped well.  I've tried three different brands of pork rinds. These seem to fluff the best in the shortest time with the least salt taste.  I'm sorry I only bought one bag to try them but I will have to get more.
5,Truly a great product. We were amazed that it would have so much flavor after running it through the microwave. Awesome stuff
4,"These taste fine and are less calories than the pre-fried ones.  Taste better plain than pre-fried ones as well.  Not all of them pop though, so there is a little waste.  One serving seems smaller after popping than the ones you buy at the store pre-popped.  Good deal though."
5,I purchased this jam for gifts for Christmas. Everyone loved the jam and my family thoroughly enjoyed it. Thank you so very much.
5,"I was thrilled to find the Maury Island Jams on Amazon.<br />The items were received very quickly, packed very efficiently.<br />I will definitely purchase them again, as all the jams are<br />excellent!"
1,"This product that I recieved was old... My dogs turned their nose up at it... My dogs really love this when they are fresh... These must have been over 1 yr old... I can't believe that Amazon had sold these... Bad, Old, Products..."
4,"My dog really loves these, and I do think (with the help of the occasional brushing) that these help her teeth stay cleaner. She just loves to munch on one and it keeps her busy for a bit, which is more than i can say for some of those wimpy treats that just add sticky gunk to your dogs teeth..."
5,"My beagle loves these bones. We give them to her every sunday as a treat after clipping nails, getting a bath or cleaning her ears. She gets so excited when I pull one out of the bag. She loves them so much that I have signed up for subscribe and save to receive them every month."
5,I got this as a gift for my brother and he loves it!  He frequently pits and stuffs his own olives and loves this great kitchen tool.  Also good for stuffing dates!
5,If you like stuffed olives get this.  Only compliant is pain to clean.  Easy to use.  You can make much better olives then expensive ones in store.
5,The Olivator is fabulous! You can use it to put bleu cheese in olives for martinis. It works really well and is easy to clean.
5,"This is an excellent product. Very nicely made and fits great into your hand. Very easy to stuff olives with this! Don't get those cheap looking stuffers, get this one!"
5,"I made excellent pie crust with Mochiko sweet rice flour, which was recommended by a recipe I had.  The crust was tender, moist and flaky.  It was so tender that it broke easily, but I was able to manage it by rolling it out on plastic wrap.  And the taste was to die for!"
5,This was the least expensive of the sweet rice flours on Amazon.  I use sweet rice flour in most of my gluten free recipes...combined with various other ingredients as a regular wheat flour substitute.  I consider this a necessary ingredient to help things hold together.
5,I really like this kind of flax seed. I've been eating flax seed with my meals for 2 years and this is the best I've stumbled upon
5,"I still have some of this; I didn't expect it to have much of a flavor, being so small, but it definitely is nutty. I have this as a snack for my daily fiber! :)"
5,"A bunch of flax seed in a sealed plastic bag.  I grind these up and put them in my morning oatmeal.  Nice source of fiber and good fats.  Barry Farms was great as always (3 orders with them so far), and I'm really liking the idea of flax seed in my diet."
5,"I am currently deployed so getting good coffe like we can easily access back at home isn't always readily available. But this canister has still lasted us quite a bit and everyone loves the taste. and considering our location, it got here within a reasonable amount of time."
1,"This coffee is great, don't buy it here, though.  Your local grocery store will have it for much less and your local Sam's club will have it for less than $13."
5,"My Bengal kitten loves this stuff. His fur feels like mink/cashmere, and he has a very healthy diet with this brand wet food."
5,My 2 month old kitten loves this! I bought this to introduce her to canned food as I found nothing but dry food at my local store for kittens. I was excited to bring this home and have her try it. It was love at first taste...she gobbled it right up!
5,"I DO NOT EVEN CARE IF THIS IS OVERPRICED, THESE ARE ABSOLUTELY DELICIOUS. THERE'S NOT A TON OF MEAT IN EACH PACKAGE, BUT IT HITS THE SPOT. GOOD LORD, THESE TASTE SO DELICIOUS, I DO NOT EVEN KNOW WHAT MORE TO SAY."
5,Best one yet.If you have not tried this one yet your missing out very tender and moist nuggets.The only negative is the 3.25 size bag is much to small.
1,"I am an avid consumer of Jack Links Beef Steak Nuggets.  This batch is stale, dry and almost tasteless.  I can purchase these in even remote gas stations and they taste juicy and wonderful. I am too lazy to return them but will never buy them over the internet again."
3,"I was expected a lot better. i LOVE the beef jerkey nuggets they are so juicy n flavorful and delicious, but when i ordered these just to try them cause i couldnt find them in any store i wasnt too happy. when i tried them they were extremely greasy and not that much flavor."
4,"These are pretty good, but a little overpriced - I would only buy if there was a promotion. Some pieces are deliciously tender and seasoned perfectly, but there usually are more that are too dried out and tough, or overseasoned."
1,"I wanted to get some jerky and since I like buffalo wings I tried these. The problem is there is way too much salt, it's disgustingly salty, way more than normal jerky. I can barely eat it. If you eat a 3.25 oz package of these you will have eaten 1840mg of sodium, instant high blood pressure."
5,I was a bit apprehensive ordering these from Amazon because I had read in other reviews that some of the jerky were moldy. I am happy to say that mine were absolutely mold-free! My family vanquished 2 packets on the spot LOL...
5,"Absolutely love these steak nuggets! Everywhere around here they go for over 8 dollars, so I was thrilled when I found out I could buy these on here. Very tender and the spices are amazing."
5,"I love the steak nuggets (and tenders) even better than their regular jerky.  I swear by all three of the Original, Peppered and Teriyaki Beef flavors."
4,"The beef nuggets are soft and easy on the teeth and tasty. If they are slightly less salty, they will be excellent.Very good snack.<br />Johnson"
4,"These were good, but I really couldn't taste the A1 in them.  Tasted similar to the original steak nuggets to me"
5,I find that the buffalo chicken jerky is great for when I'm craving buffalo wings late at night. Sure they're not the saucy goodness of wings at a bar but they definitely replicate the flavor. They are very hot but delicious.
5,"I really like the product.  It was super easy to order online and have it delivered.  Much cheaper than buying in a gas station.  Stocking up is good for long drives, too."
5,The bite size chewables are wonderful - 2 or 3 every few hours lets yu diet and never feel hungry.
5,I purchased these to snack on after my workouts. Now I find myself just snacking on them all the time!! They're really good and come in a variety of flavors.
5,"These are strangely addictive - and a good sugarless snack.  I like this flavor and the original, but the pepper is really strong.  Enjoy!"
4,"This is a nice tasty option that's totally different from jerky.  Convenient on the go just like jerky.  I would have given it five stars if not for the fact that it's quite salty, and that detracts from the flavor."
4,This is very good just a little too much of the A-1 flavor for us. Next time will order another flavor. If you really  love A-1 you will be pleased with it.
5,"They are tasty, well flavored, always premium cuts, nothing tasted substandard.  On top of that high protein and low calorie! Only problem - everybody else thinks the same thing and its hard for Jack Links to keep them in stock.  You may have to wait a few extra days for the specialty orders."
5,"I love this product! Tasty and soft (but not too soft). Very good flavor and it's safe to say, I can't ""eat just one!"" If you like the jerky, but not the dried up, tough stuff...you might want to give this stuff a try!"
4,"These are nice tender jerky nuggets, more tender than the usual beef jerky.  Flavor is very good, great for energy on hiking trips."
5,The Flamin Buffalo has just the right amount of heat and flavor combined.  I wish I could buy the flavor so I could put them on my wings.  Very good product.
5,"These are really good. Not hard to chew like some other beef nuggets, and they don't dry out so much.<br /><br />They only downside is that the bag stays very moist inside, so it can be a little messy. If you try to eat a bag while on the drive home you have grease all over your steering wheel....."
5,"this is the best ""jerky"" product on the market .... I have tried them all... I hope the company will expand it's production and distribution of it !!"
5,I love the Beef Teriyaki Nuggets and the Buffalo Chicken Nuggets. Now I have a 3rd kind to eat. These are great tasting and easy to eat (important for post bariatric surgery people). I love Jack Link's Nuggets line!
4,I love em.  I would give this 5 stars but there arent enough in the bag to warrent that.  they are good.
1,"Oh my gosh, these are gross. I bought them because of Hungry Girl's glowing recommendation...and I gotta say, she steered me wrong this time. These are SUPER salty, and they taste like what I imagine dog kibbles would taste like."
2,these are good but verrry sweet.... they taste kind of chinese sweet bbq sauce... high protein
3,They have a funky flavour and really get all over you fingers. I bought these to eat while driving it it isn't going to work.
5,"These syrups for Sno Cones are delicious. Our family loves them, we had also purchased a pack of the Hawaiian Ice syrups and we prefer these (and they are cheaper). A very good deal. I will be buying more soon."
5,"EXCELLENT PRODUCT, SWEET TASTY AND THE KIDS LOVE THEM....GREAT FOR PARTIES OR ANY HOT SUMMER DAY....ALL OF THE FLAVORS TASTE GREAT..."
4,These syrups are great for slushes. My kids love them and they are great for summer parties. Very good product.
5,"I bought a 10 pack of quart bottles of Great Northern syrups for my Polar Ice Cub shaver and they are so good, we all love it.  Well worth it."
5,A very easy process with good communication and the product exactly as advertised.  I particularly appreciate the packing - very secure.
5,"Worth every penny, a little goes a long way.  Ordered these and many snowcones later, still have plenty.  The taste is awesome, and the thicker syrup covers the ice great."
5,"I bought a 10 pack of this snow cone syrup for my grandchildren & they just love it. The taste is great & it's nice having it already to go, no mixing. I would/will be buying from them again."
5,I had recently bought an Hawaiian Ice Machine from Great Northern which we love.  The kids loved the flavors and the added cones and straws are an added bonus.  A little pricey but delivered to your door and ready to go.
5,"this product is the best in usa , We bought this for our grown-up snow cones. Absolutely yummy. Pour spouts are easy to use Flavours are delicious"
5,This is by far the best truffle oil on the market.  It is the one we use at my restuarant and at my home.  It is very fragrant and has wonderful truffle flavor.
1,This product previously ordered and excellent but this time tasted old and was very hard---finally threw it away.<br /><br />Still have not figured out how I ever got it in first place as ordered another product from Amazon and somehow got this  as well?????
4,"Sorry, no long winded review - it is what it says it is, Hamburger Helper.  It's dirt cheap and tasted great."
5,I love this coffee and the price is remarkable for a gourmet product. I have bought from other high-end coffee dealers and spent an arm and a leg and waited a lot longer to receive it. Very quick delivery. Excellent price and product. Can't wait to try the next flavor.
5,This coffee is the best I have ever had.  If you like good coffee you should try it.  I mix it with another coffee that is not as strong but the results are wonderful.
5,"It is the best coffee I ever tasted.  I usually add a little sugar and French Vanilla cream, but it is delicious black.  I gave a bag of coffee to a friend and she was amazed at the great taste, flavor and aroma.  I will be ordering this coffee for holiday gifts."
5,"Great taste,look forward to it every morning. We wish that when we dine out it was available. We also love automatic deliverys from Amazon.Did I say the price also is very good."
5,"I enjoy the Coffee Master Flavored Coffee,""Jamaican Me Crazy"".  It is very tasty and I will reorder when empty.  The ""Butter Pecan""flavor is great also, and I will highly recommend both flavors. This is high premium coffee.  You will not be disappointed.  The flavor is just right not overbearing."
4,I really like this whole wheat orzo a lot.  Now if I could just find ditalini.  I would recommend this to anyone who loves orzo but does not want to eat white flour.  this is for you.
5,This was just too cute. Has a great story on the bottom to go along with the tug boat theme. The cookies were fresh and tasted good.
5,We ordered this product for our vacation rental property. It was delivered quickly and was exactly as expected. I will continue to order this item.
5,Each filter pack is perfect for brewing 4 cups of coffee. This is that great Maxwell House flavor from filter packs that are incredibly easy to use. My coffee making skills are very limited and I get compliments on my coffee now! Highly recommended
5,Too often someone does not bring all of the supplies.  These canisters make is so much easier to get a fresh cup of coffee without grounds to clean up afterwards!
5,I cannot find these in stores anymore and have used them for years. Hope they are available soon!
5,I like these cause I dont have to measure it. and its a good price on here.
5,"This is a really good gum.  It lasts longer than any other gum we have tried and has a great flavor, too."
5,"pit terrier and cockapoo loved these a bit more than the other treats we had.was it the ranch flavor? was it the texture? we can only speculate, but they know for sure!oooh, those nummerz treats they love to munch!grama even ate one by mistake!"
1,Raving reviews made me buy this for dogs.<br />I have a lab mix a beagle and 2 Shepards that I got from impoundment and they're not spoiled.<br />One chewed it to crumbles but left it on the ground and my Shepards have been burying them in the backyard.<br />I wasted my money on this one.
5,"I expect anything from Newman's Own to be a quality product, and according to Fluffy and Princess, these treats live up to this reputation.  Not that they are particularly discriminating when<br />it comes to what they put in their mouths, but they did enjoy these and I will probably buy more."
5,"This review is for Newman's Own Organics Lamb and Barley New Zealand Ranch Style Dog Treats. There is really not much to say here. The dogs loved the treats, and they didn't last long at all. My only complaint is that I don't thing the name of the product is long enough :)"
5,"My pup really liked these treats.  So much when I wasn't looking she somehow got them off ""her shelf"" & ate half the bag at on sitting.  She's pretty sneaky sometimes.  They didn't really smell or look appealing to me, but obviously to her she loves her new yummy treats."
4,"I have two dogs-a Welsh Corgi and a medium sized mixed breed, and they both LOVE these treats! They smell good and are sturdy-not crumbly. The only thing I would change is to make them a little smaller, as I try to help my dogs watch their weight!"
5,"I have one doglet, a miniature schnauzer, who gulps down everything, so was not surprised when she inhaled these.  But my toy poodle is very picky, and even SHE loves these!  I will be buying more.  I love knowing they are GOOD for my dogs, too."
5,My dog loved these treats and I could feed it to him knowing they were good for him.  I trust Newman's Own to have exactly what they say on the package ingredients and to be wholesome.  They are scored so that you can break them in two if you want to.  They are easy to transport on a walk.
5,"<span class=""tiny""> Length:: 1:15 Mins<br /><br /></span>These are great treats that will please the most discriminating canine palate."
5,"these are really hard so, besides being good for them, they are great for their teeth. All three of my dogs love these treats, even my fussy Chi. I highly recommend these doggy treats."
5,"The ingredients are natural and acceptable for my mutts. I always feed them natural or organic food and snacks.<br /><br />They loved these Newman snacks. As I said, 4 Paws Up!"
4,My puggle likes these but they are not her favorite. I like the fact they are a Newman's natural product and have lamb in them. They come in double squares you can break in half. My dog probably would like more if they were molded in a small or mini bone shape.
5,"We gave these out to grooming customers, and the reports we got back were that the dogs loved them.  They're all natural, so I felt comfortable giving them out."
5,I really did not think my picky a** dogs would eat them. I tossed the treats to them and waited for the sniff of dis approval. Waiting...waiting.. chomp chomp and they are gone to another room to enjoy the treat in peace. Two dogs give them a paws up.
5,The ingedients and farming methods are impressive.  More impressive is the dog's reaction to these treats.  Wave one and I can get him to do almost anything.  Good dog.  Really good treats.
5,"I fed these to a friends dog.  I really couldn't get much feedback from him as he was busy snarfing them down, but he seems to *really* like me now.  The bag only lasted a few weeks and the dog is now depressed."
5,"The only treat my dog gets! Totally good, and well worth the subscription price. The snacks are a great nutrition benefit for him too."
5,"I can't speak for myself, but my dog usually hates most ""dog biscuit""  style treats.  In contrast to her usual preference, these were a strong favorite.  They don't smell or feel like meat, and have no greasy residue that many meaty treats have.  But the dog loves them like they are chunks of beef."
5,"This is not for puppies. These are very hard and good for cleaning teeth. My 6 year old German Shepard and border collie mix loves these. The first time she had one, she played with it. Once she had the nerve to really chop down on it, she was in heaven and asked for more."
1,Don't know much to say except they smelled funny upon opening the bag and neither of our 2 dogs would go anywhere near them.
4,My dog likes these and they seem like they're relatively good quality so I will get them again. I have a large breed (Dalmatian) who is hypothyroid so he has some associated skin issues. These treats don't seem to bother his skin at all.
5,"This will have to be short, but sweet as I have a tail to chase... Shockingly, as a dog that likes to eat unhealthy table scraps and turns his nose up to anything ""organic"" and ""healthy"", I have to admit that I really liked these treats! Woof! Woof!"
5,"Our lab/border collie mix is a big fan of these treats!  Of course, dogs are a fan of most treats, but these did not cost any 'ill' side effects / digestion problems.  I will definitely purchase more!"
5,"Usually my dog is particular about his treats. When he got a whiff of these ""treat time"" was over quickly.  Just picking up the package got him excited. I will be buying these."
3,"It seems dogs are more like people than we think, give them healthy treat, they have no interest in them, give em the junkie ones filled with chemicals, they eat those....oh welll..."
5,"My dog tends to get stomach problems if he's fed non-organic food, so I'm careful to always buy him organic (he probably eats better than I do). He snarfed up these treats readily and clearly enjoyed them, with no resulting tummy troubles that we saw."
3,My dogs couldn't eat these treats. They were far too large and hard. However my neighbors dogs (a lab and boxer) loved them. Don't get these unless your dog has large strong teeth. Otherwise they seem like a good and healthy treat for your pet.
4,"Our 7-month old puppy, Banjo, loves these treats!!!<br /><br />-1 star since these treats are really hard to break into smaller pieces."
5,"These treats are well liked by dogs, the right size and don't smell or feel too gross in your hands.  Not really sure what else to say about them except that if organic is important to you, then these seem to be one of the few options for dog treats out there.  I will buy them again."
5,"What can a person say about a dog treat?  My yellow lab loves these treats, and I like that they are an organic product.  I also like that Newmans Own donates to charity.  If these are important to you, I recommend the treats."
5,"Our dog, Amber, totally loves these.  She hungrily crunched them down.  Highly recommended.  I'm sure your dog will really love them!"
5,Bengal spice is just perfect either for Ice tea or for hot tea! Also it make the Chai latte special! Thanks!
5,"I love this tea.  It is very rich in taste, smells wonderful, and doesn't leave a funny after taste.  It's my favorite herb tea."
5,"This tea has been a favorite in my family for years. It's difficult to find locally, so I was so happy to find it at the Vitamin Shoppe and at such a great price. It's a spicy tea, great with toast or crackers or just by itself.  If you like Chai, you'll love this bolder version."
5,I always found green tea to be bitter.  Not this tea.  It actually tastes good.  I love almost all of the flavors of Yogi tea.
4,Great alternative to fettuccine if you have gluten problems. Sauce is a big helper for taste and don't boil them to long. They will clump. Overall I am very happy with them.
5,DE BOLES MAKES THE BEST GLUTEN FREE PRODUCTS.  I HAVE BEEN USING THIS STYLE AND OTHER VARITIES FOR YEARS.  SO GLAD TO GET THEM ON AMAZON AT SUCH A GREAT PRICE.
3,"Basket was smaller than anticipated for the price, bought it for a raffle and was disappointed. It also came in a different basket than was shown."
5,What else can I say? No other candy bar has this great taste of divine chocolate with the perfect combination of raisins and nuts. A favorite of mine since a little girl. Arrived fine when I bought them but watch out for hot weather deliveries.
4,We got this to make homemade Sushi rice.  It does it's job flavoring the rice and you get quite a bit to a package.  Thankfully Amazon had this because our Asian supermarket didn't!
5,This product is amazing! It came quickly and taistes delicious. I have ground it up and put it in my smoothies and oatmeal and lots of other dishes. Very delicious and healthy.
5,Far and away some of the best chocolate available. This product needs to return to store shelves for purchase anytime. Becoming harder to find. These chocolates are an old time favorite.
5,"I love brewing chamomile tea from scratch, it's one of the best things to help me fall asleep after a stressful day at work. This is great stuff and has a great price!: )"
2,"My son's celiac so we're very familiar with gluten free products.  I bought these because I trust the Glutino brand name but really, they're just not that great.  We tried them once and that was it because they're bland and tasteless.  There are better gluten free alternatives out there."
5,We have five family members on the GF diet.  These are their favorite crackers.  Even those in our family who are not on GF diet like these crackers.  Highly recommended.
5,"These are great - I don't much like the other gluten-free cracker options (e.g. rice crackers, etc.) but these taste pretty close to ""normal.""  I've also used them in recipes, like as a topping for broccoli casserole, and they worked great."
5,These are the best gluten free crackers I have had so far.  I saved $5.00 by buying them through amazon than buying them at the grocery stores.
5,"Texture and taste most similar to the stuff with gluten. Rice crackers always had a weird texture and had sharp edges that hurt my mouth, these are perfect and hold up well. Quite yummy with cheese!"
5,My six year old son loves these crackers.  They are the only kind he'll eat and I 've tried at least half a dozen.  I've used them as substitutions in several recipes without anyone noticing.
1,"I love these crackers, but recently ordered a case for my daughter's baby shower - Out of 6 boxes I got about 24 whole crackers - the rest were broken, most were crumbs. Very disappointing."
3,The taste is great but most of the crackers are broken.  I am maybe getting 12 whole crackers per box.  The first time I ordered these there were several broken but this time there are more broken than whole.
5,I love these crackers and decided it's best just to buy in bulk.  The crackers came fast and they are in tact.  Very fresh and delicious!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
5,There is not a gluten-free cracker any better than this one: I LOVE these crackers because they are so tasty & order them via subscription so I always have a supply.
5,"excellent product, my kids and myself love it- the right texture/ the right btaste.  Will buy it again, stays fresh for a couple of days"
5,Glutino crackers taste better than any of the other gluten free crackers that I have tried. It is nice that there are so many choices available for those that need alternatives.
1,"One word, yuk. OK, based on the 20 word minimum; barely edible dry, chalky, flavorless, not even improved or masked with a good slice of cheddar cheese."
5,"These are some of the tastiest GF crackers. My 6 year old daughter loves them. They also look the most like non-GF crackers, which helps my daughter feel a little less self conscious when she takes them to school. Amazon sells them for a great price. Thanks Amazon!"
1,I've tried and tried to convince myself that these crackers are acceptable but they just aren't. If you are desperate for a cracker find another. I rarely throw any food out but I made an exception in this case. It is terrible.
4,"If you want a good plain cracker that won't compete with your topping of choice, this is a good option.  Not a lot of flavor, but sometimes that's a good thing :-)"
3,Great taste for a glutin-free alternative. Still have some of the symptoms w/this as I do w/foods made from wheat flour. :(
5,"These crackers are the tastiest gluten-free crackers I have found, and I have been looking for 25 years.  They do break easy, though, so spreading anything firmer than peanut butter on them will often result in breakage.  Because of the great taste, I'm willing to overlook this flaw."
5,I've been gluten-free for 4 months and was dying for some cheese and crackers.  These are amazing!!! I had them on vacation with some friends who aren't eating gluten-free and they still loved these crackers.  I'm going to order a few cases of these and stock up!
4,Good for wheat free diets. My son likes them.good choice for kids on this type of a diet.I recommend  them.
4,"These are the closest thing to real crackers you're going to find in the Gluten Free world. If you can't have the real thing, buy these..."
5,"I have tried several snacks and crackers that are gluten free.  They are, for the most part, tasteless and dry.<br />These crackers have great taste and can be eaten by themselves or with dips and sweets.  They are delicious!"
1,We love these crackers but getting them through the mail doesn't work - all the crackers were broken and crumbly.
1,They were okay when you first bit into them but then chewing them made them gummy & nasty.  I'd rather do without.
5,I was realy impressed with these they do not taste like the old GF crackers I have bought before. They are actualy good and does remind me of wheat crackers like I use to eat. Thank you Amazon.
5,"These crackers rule!!  All I can say is yum yum yum!!!  The best cracker that I have had in a long time.  Thank you Glutino for making such a good product that takes like ""gluten"" crackers!!"
5,I couldn't believe it the first time i tried Glutino crackers.  It actually tastes like a RITZ cracker.  No flaxseed or pine-nut flavors to overpower what you put on the cracker.  It's just a great cracker with just the right flavor for snacking!  I love this product!!!
3,"Even in the stores, they tend to be broken, but these on average are worse. Given the price per cracker, that makes them really expensive.<br /><br />Love the crackers themselves. They are the best vehicle for peanut butter and jam that I've found."
5,Our 8 yr old with celiac loves this cracker. Great with soup or for PB&J.
1,"These are no good. I got them thinking they would be a great snack with cheese or meat or jelly...  My kid won't eat them at all and I don't blame him.  They have no flavor, and nothing seems to help. I wouldn't buy them again."
2,"I ordered 6 boxes of these crackers. The crackers are very good, however, all of the crackers (in all 6 boxes) were nothing but crumbs when I received them!"
5,"They seem a bit pricey, but they don't have the aftertaste other GF crackers have had.  It was nice to get a case so we don't run out so fast and I can share them with friends.  It will be great when GF products are so popular the price comes down."
5,These crackers are just like I remember crackers tasting like before I went gluten free.  They are a crunchy mix between a buttery Ritz and saltine.  Delicious!
5,These crackers have the texture of ritz and a very pleasant flavor.  I am so happy I tried them!
5,These are the closest to regular crackers I have found yet.  Great flavor and consistency.
4,"but the price is too high.It's food with no real nutrition, simple to make,should be not more then $2."
5,"My daughter has eaten gluten free for 8 years now (she's 13).  These are her favorite crackers and the only ones we eat in the house (I don't have any wheat here).  We use them for all occassions, recipe's, and recently started making smores with a marshmallow and melted Hershey's chocolate-  YUM!!"
2,Food is very much a personal preference but I really don't like any of these crackers made by this company. They taste like flavored paper. Someone said better than nothing but I'd rather have something else.
2,"Glutino crackers are among our favorite GF crackers, but if you have a store in your area that sells them, that might be a better bet. About half of our crackers (in all 6 boxes) arrived broken."
3,"these crackers are great, but the packaging is so poor that you are lucky if you get 5 crackers from one bag that are not broken!  I really wish this company would change their packaging, so that you would get whole crackers not broken ones."
5,"These are the best tasting GFCF crackers on the market.  They do not fall apart, they are flavorful, and taste just like ""REAL CRACKERS""  My son who is a picky eater LOVES them!!!"
4,Much more roses than I expected & I was very pleased with the color & aroma.  The only drawback for me is that there is a lot of the green stuff (the flower bases) & for a lot of recipes I just want the petals.
1,"I was disappointed by these eucalyptus leaves - they have a stale, oregano-like smell. Ask your local florist to get you some fresh leaves!"
3,I received my ordered and many of the peach gummis were stuck together and could not be picked apart.  I am not very happy as these were supposed to be favors for a birthday party.
5,Received package and was just as I wanted plus!  I enjoyed getting a piece of the candy from the box.  It arrived on time and I am ordering another box!  Just wish shipping was not so high but is not their fault.
5,"A big box of my favorite candy at a very good price.<br /><br />The candy is as you would expect from a store-bought package, individually wrapped silvery-plastic wrappers (not the foil like the picture seems to indicate)."
5,How can you go wrong with peppermint patties? The box of candy is the size that you see sitting in stores for a single-piece purchase. Perfect for the pantry!
5,"My sweet and genius husband bought me this as one of my Valentine's Day this year! Amazingly, it lasted me a month. And they were delicious!"
1,"Sorry, but I dont eat mexican or chinese made candies. I now buy pearsons or palmers peppermint patties. Check the labels folks foreign factories dont have food safety regulations."
4,"Both my dogs love these treats.  They are a bit pricey if you have an aggressive chewer.  However, they are great and the dogs go crazy for them."
4,My dog cannot get enough of these and I feed him 1 everyday and have been buying them for a few years.  Every year my vet asked what I dog to keep my dogs teeth clean!?
4,"My puppies go nuts for these things. They seem to really satisfy the urge to chew. I'd give them 5 stars, but I think they're a bit overpriced. Still, this is a much better deal than at Petsmart."
5,My Rottie puppy expects one of these each night when I turn off the lights for her to go to sleep.  I sure hope they're good for her 'cuz she loves them.
5,"I was happy to fine a product that is easily digestible by dogs. too many products out there can cause internal problems and even death to you pet if you are not careful.<br /><br />Bill Drews<br /><br />Hot springs, AR"
5,"When we adopted our 8 year old Basset Hound, her back teeth were solid dark brown and crusted.  After about 5 months giving her one of these per day, the teeth are about 80% cleaned."
5,I buy the medium treats for my 19 lb Long Hair Chihuahua mix and he loves these! They are pricey but cheaper than what you will find at the store or Pet store. He gets one every other day...it actually helps his digestion in my opinion. If you get them on Subscription they are even cheaper.
5,"My dog is very picky, but he loves this green bone. The bone has 360 spike which can clean his teeth no matter which way he chew the bone."
5,"These are softer and seem easier to digest than the Greenies brand.  I really like the Greenies, but my dogs were unable to completely chew them as well as the Nylabones."
4,Good product poor packing from shipper.  Had several leaking into box which made them all sticky.  Had to wash off before storing for use.
5,This was exactly what I was looking for so that I don't have to use up fridge space for my coffee condiments.  They all came to me with no damage what-so-ever.  Not a single one that I have seen yet has been broken.
1,this item arrived with a horrible mess. broken and sticky. i want my money back! i am so dissappointed. i expected better from amazon.
5,"Good price, great product and very convenient.  My daughter in college was running to the grocery every week to buy creamer and put it in her roommate's fridge.  Not anymore. She keeps these in a container near the coffee maker in her dorm."
5,"Good. Exactly as advertised. I was surprised that not a single one broke open during shipping, so A+ on the durability of each individual packet.<br /><br />Be warned though, that these creamers are not very sweet."
5,Perfect coffee creamer for my coffee. Perfect addition to my coffee. Would recommend to anyone who needs a perfect compliment to your morning coffee.
5,"I love International Delight French Vanilla, lots better than Coffee Mate brand. I will only purchase International Delight Creamer. It works great when I travel except on an airplane."
1,"I ordered these for work and they came all in a box, no problem.<br />There was a problem with some of them being broken and leaking all over. I wrote an email to the seller letting them know that but to this date, still havent heard a word from, them.. Good customer service."
5,We like this coffee creamer and have been using it for years. So our main concern with ordering it was would any of the individual containers break. We received the item with none of the containers broken. So for the cost this is a great buy.
5,"Got hooked on this when I was traveling the US, now I can't live without it. Packaging has improved, and everything arrived in one piece."
5,I have ordered this product on a monthly basis. I love that it comes to my home.  I have read other reviews and have read that they recieve them damaged. I have to tell you mine come in perfect order. I hope for those of you who order this product the same results.
5,THE CREAMER IS HIGHLY INDIVIDUALIZED AND PORTABLE<br />EASY TO STORE WITHOUT REFRIGERATION.  GOOD PRICE & HIGHLY RECOMMENDED FOR OFFICE AND HOME USES
5,The product does come in one bag then boxed. I was fortunate that I did not have any come open in transit. Also I am loving the fact that they do not have to be refrigerated (so I can keep them at work).
5,Very convenient for me because I don't have to keep running to the store and purchase these small boxes that only have about 24 individuals and expensive.
5,"My first box came with some of the packets opened and they were all sticky.  I contacted you and the recieved another box free.  They were packed much better, and arrived intact.  Thank you so much.  We love these!!"
5,Ordered two for my partner who is on a navy cruise and he said that none of them broke and wanted more already lol (i guess they took to long to get there...so here's to purchasing more)
5,This is a great buy for the price.  I can't get this kind of deal anywhere local.  I will buy my cream this way as long as I can get it here.
3,"Excellent vanilla flavor. However I was not ""delighted"" that it curdled in hot coffee!!! Nasty and very unappetizing in appearance. I gave up using for hot coffee and use it for ""iced coffee"" with great results."
5,"Mine showed up fine with no damage. Not packed well, so I could see how these could show up squashed or leaking, but mine were fine. Saved money by using the subscription discount off of Amazon."
2,This product was what I like. But this shipment looks like 2eds. not good enough for the store shelves. Containers were dented and some had leaked out making everything sticky.
1,Don't bother getting these. You'll spend more time cleaning up the mess due to the poor packaging then you'll spend enjoying them.
1,"Long story short.  Creamers thrown into single box, no protection.  Opened box and there was liquid creamer all over the contents.  Think twice before oredering or subscribing."
2,"The creamer is fine, it was the creamers that had exploded in the box that were the problem. The few that did break open left the whole box covered and sticky. So I had to go and hand wash all of them before putting them out for our staff and clients. Simply irritating..."
2,"MORE OF THE PRODUCT IN THE PACKING BOX ARE LEAKING OUT, AT LEAST 10 OF THE SINGLE SERVE PACKAGES LEAK OUT IN THE BOX. WITH ALL THE CREAMERS I HAVE ORDERED THROUGH YOU HAVE PACKAGES THAT HAVE LEAKED ALL OVER THE BOX. I AM LOOKING AT OTHER SOURCES FOR MY PRODUCT."
1,"As other reviewers noted, more than dozen of items were broken, so the box was sticky and some of them still had creamer on them. Also the expiration date is June 2010 which less than 6 months away, I wont be able to use them before the sell by date."
5,"This item arrived when it was supposed to. It is so convenient. You don't even have to refrigerate it. So, that is one less step you have to take in the morning just to get a cup of coffee. It tastes exactly like the refrigerated stuff. It is so good."
5,"I purposely bought this packet of individual creamers to keep track of calories. Not only is one creamer 30 calories, they are DELICIOUS and add a great flavor to your coffee. Definitly recommended. You can also store them for a while, since they last for quite some time. Enjoy your cup of coffee!"
5,"After getting used to using product where I live, and with everyone else using it they would run out witin 2 days.  so, now when thry run out, I have my own. You should see the looks on their faces when I still have some...."
1,I received the item and found 10 of them were crushed and spilled onto others.<br />My mother spent about 30 minutes to clean.<br />Didn't want to return as it is not worth my while.<br />Always liked this particular creamer but wasn't happy to see a lot of them crushed inside the box.
5,but be aware.  It is addictive.  I love this stuff in anything from beverages to my instant oatmeal.  Try it and you will agree. And by signing up for scheduled delivery I am never without it in the house
3,"These are chocolatey with a touch of spice. Tasty but expensive, I imagine this is something you could make at home! But these are good overall."
5,"I've never found anything that works better than this for mild tummy trouble.  Tums, Mylanta, etc. etc. have never worked well for me.  This tea settles my stomach right away."
5,"I love this tea, it is great for people who suffer from IBS.  It helps relieve bloating and gas from foods.  Great tasting too!"
5,It works. Everybody at work comes and asks me for this tea when their stomach is upset or when they eat too much or have gas. Also it has a nice sweet taste. No sugar required.
4,"It's an acquired taste, but it works.  For IBS sufferers with few other options for stomach relief I'd definately give it a try."
5,I have had alot of stomach problems over many years and this is an excellent tea for settling my stomach quickly. It also works great if you have overeaten and feel uncomfortable - so good I buy it by the case!
5,One of my favorite teas for digestion.  I probably drink 4-5 cups of this tea every day.
5,"This tea is great for nausea, or any stomach discomfort.  One cup and I feel great.  I add a little honey and some lemon for flavor, but the results are fantastic."
5,"I found Yogi Tea at the local grocery store & from then on we began an amazing love affair! (shhh, don't tell my husband!) I love all their teas & this Stomach Ease one is perfect for those times when I'm not feeling so hot ""south of the belly-button"" ;o) (my kids even love it!)"
5,I love this tea so much. It is like magic. And the taste is WONDERFUL! Thank you so much for making my new favorite tea.
5,"Very good tea to relieve stomach upset, the feeling of bloating and general digestive unease."
5,"I have had mystery stomach issues since my early teens (I'm 43). Nothing has helped.  Then I tried this tea.  I was already a Yogi Tea fan.  Just one cup of this when I have stomach ""issues"" and they just go away in a matter of about 30 minutes.  Love it."
5,"I tend to get upset stomach/nausea in the evennings. This NEVER fails to make me feel better. I love it. They don't sell it at stores in my area anymore, so I was fine with buying a case of it!"
5,"Having tried many indigestion products, this tea really soothes and relieves stomach and indigestion problems plus it tastes great also."
5,This is my favorite tea and I have tried dozens of different flavors and brands.  I have a sensitive stomach and sometimes this tea soothes my stomach.  It's cheaper ordering it from Amazon than buying it from my local supermarket.
3,I got this for Father's day and my dad loved it and did not mention one thing about it being small or anything. This really made his day so I am pleased with the idea to order the gift for him. I would recommend it!
5,my cat absolutely loves these treats & they were first givin to mr by my vet who is also a friend. musc less expensive with amazon
5,Cats have many things that pass through their mouths causing tartar buildup and eventual decay of teeth. Just like with people they need a little help with their dental hygiene. These tidbits - shaped like litte fish - are a tasty and effective solution. Difficulty is ignoring the crys for more.
5,"I have several very, very finicky cats and they ALL are absolutely crazy for these Butler Tartar Control treats !  The best part (to me) is that these are healthy treats, as well.<br /><br />I highly recommend this for any cat ""parent"" !!"
5,"My cats go insane over these treats. As soon as they hear the bag rattle, they dart to wherever it is. Purchasing through [...]  was easy, cost-efficient and the shipping was fast."
5,I was really looking for the larger cans but could not locate any.  These are perfect for someone who occasionally has a need for a New Mexico chili with each can containing 2-3 chilis.
5,"After living in New Mexico for 4 years, the green chili withdrawal was BRUTAL! The canned version of anything is never as good as getting it fresh, but this brand is far superior to anything available locally where we're living now and the small can is perfect for a 2-person household."
5,"As with the Thai Peanut flavor, this hot-n-spicy vegan jerky is a winner! The spice is nice and a great addition to any meal."
4,"Great, high- protein snack without meat.  I would give it 5 starts if it were not so sweet."
5,"Mix this half and half with Orange Crush over ice and it tastes just like a creamiscle.  It's very yummy, but gets you drunk pretty quickly."
5,I love the bold flavors of K*Cups and this way you get 50 of them for so much less that other places.<br /><br />http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B004M5W7YQ/ref=cm_cr_rev_prod_title
5,Never went wrong with this kcup. I usually buy this and Donut shop and get this because it is a strong coffee. Not to bitter either
5,I have ordered this several times and like the fairly rich taste without any bitterness. It is also very smooth and is one of the better K-cups that I have found so far.
4,I was very impressed with how bold this coffee is. This is easily my new favorite early morning brew. Bam!
5,"If you enjoy a bold coffee, this is a great pick!  I purchased a Keurig brewer this spring and I order different types of coffee to experiment to find the ""perfect"" cup.  I will definately reorder Emerill's Big Easy"
5,"The coffee is dark and rich, without being acid. This coffee is for those who like their brew to fill their nose as well as their cup."
5,"It's a nice bold, strong flavored cup of coffee.  Goes great with a sweet breakfast.  Also a good strong kick in the pants in the morning.  This is one of my favorite K-cups."
5,"what's not to like??????? pleasingly great bold taste.....and price is quite lower than in the stores, even Wal-mart!!!....will definitely purchase again!"
5,"This is by far my favorite bold coffee!!  It is rich, bold and holds up well with my flavored creamer!!"
5,"We've tried many different K-Cup blends, but this one by far (or, rather, so far) is our favorite.  We like a bold taste and Emeril's is both bold enough and flavorful.  Newman's Special blend was our previous favorite, but this far outshines it, I believe."
5,A rich bold taste that maintains smoothness.  No bitter aftertaste.  Have nver had a better K-cup.  If they had six stars this one would receive it.
5,The order came as described.  Packing was perfect.  No problems whatsoever with it.  The taste is great for a strong decent cup of coffee.
5,"This is the better coffee I have found in a K Cup. Deep, rich, smooth flavor. No bitterness. Worth the few extra cents per cup."
3,"I like the flavor of coffee, but Emeril's doesn't have that traditional coffee flavor. It's pretty bitter--so much so, that 2 Splenda packets in a 16 oz cup don't mask the bitterness. Three stars because it's tolerable, but I'm holding out for tastier coffee."
5,I always drink one cup of coffee on the way to work.  Emerils coffee is bold and full of flavor and with a little vanilla creamer added it's the perfect way to get my day started.
5,"I FOUND EMERILS COFFEE TO BE ONE OF THE BEST TASTING COFFEE IF YOU LIKE A BOLD COFFEE,,I ALWAYS KEEP THIS PRODUCT IN MY HOME,,"
5,"Emeril's Big Easy Bold is very bold and tasty and a great way to start the day! Not an expert on New Orlean's style coffee, but I love it's flavor!"
5,I have been ordeing this product for about a year now.  It is great coffee.  You should buy if you bold coffee.
5,"This is great robust coffee (my favorite), and the price per k-cup is the best I've found so far.  I'll buy it again."
5,My order is a repeat order as we have enjoyed this coffee for a long time.  The price offered at Amazon is good and the delivery is very quick.  I do recommend this product to anyone who enjoys a good cup of coffee each morning and at coffee-break time.  MLF
4,This is very good coffee.  I enjoy the bold taste and I look forward to making a cup or two daily!
5,"Went through virtually every bold, dark coffee for my Keurig.  Emerils Big Easy Bold is the best dark coffee in the class, not in the slightest way bitter.  The pack of 50 is a great bargain,"
5,"This is always my first cup of coffee for the day - strong, but very smooth. It never fails to wake me up and get me going. And it's very nice to have the 50 pack available."
5,"I received a Kuerig machine for my birthday and a variety pack came with it. So far I like Emeril's coffee the best,I will be purchasing more."
5,"We get this on a regular monthly shipment and enjoy a decent discount. Coffee has gone up some , but we love this and Amazon has the best deal ! Wish Costco or Sam's would carry it like some others as their deals are the best!"
4,"Price keeps going up, up, up.  Next price increase<br />and I'm out of here.  Product is good but getting too<br />expensive."
5,"Due to my 8 year exposure to Louisiana, I can reliably say this coffee is the best substitute for a Keurig based cafe au lait attempt. Aside from that, it is a tasty dark blend, you just have to look at Emeril each time, then jab him in the head with the K-cup assembly."
5,"I don't really drink this coffee, but my hubby has at least 2 cups a day of it and says it's a really great bold coffee. We use subscribe and save for it because it is a ""regular"" at our house."
5,I purchased Emeril's Bold for a vacation with 14 people.  For the person who wants a stronger flavor Emerils is just right. I would purchase this again.
5,My favorite so far.  Bold but smooth with no bitter after taste. Highly recommend if you like a bold coffee.
5,"Excellent BOLD coffee ... if you're a weak coffee drinker, then this coffee isn't for you ... if you love tasting coffee ... you'll love this blend ..."
5,"Bold is Bold is Bold yet smooth. Typically I am leery  of celebrity products but I have ordered and reordered this product and it has been consistent over time, well priced and is bold but not overly ""barky"" enjoy."
5,"My husband and I always a cup of Big Easy Bold every morning.  Its quality has been consistent over the past several years we have ordered.  If you like a dark roast, without the bitterness sometimes found in dark roasts, this is the coffee for you."
5,Had a cup of low grade restaurant coffee yesterday morning.  Made me realize just how spoiled I am to have the opportunity to drink Emeril's Big Easy Bold every morning.  It has become our favorite!
5,The Emeril Lagasse coffee has good flavor - I would compare it to Dunkin' Donuts coffee in terms of flavor / strength. This pack of 50 is priced well and contains less packaging a win-win for us!
2,Not very good and I love bold coffee. Kona coffee and pretty much Tulleys brand in general is MUCH better.
5,Just the way I like it. Bold and full flavored.  I drink it black and love the taste.  A favorite around the house.
5,"This is the best way to go for your Keurig Coffee Maker.  Amazon ever writes a week earlier reminding you they are shipping and asks you if you want to skip this shipment, go ahead with it, or ship one week earlier (just in case you're running out).  Great great service. Go for it."
5,"Emeril's Big Easy is a stong, dramatic coffee with a lot of kick.  It will wake you up and keep you going all day long.  I love everything about this coffee.  If you like your coffee to be like colored water, don't order this one..it is only for real coffee lovers."
3,Excellent coffee flavor - robust without being bitter.  I'd give this a five star rating were it not for the amount of grounds and sludge that are produced.  Don't drink the last quarter of your cup!
5,Love this Keurig Coffee; of course when they started offering it in a 50 pack just could not resist!!! You get a real coffee with robust taste and smoothness! Can't get enough of it. We have many Keurigs and even the small one for on the go! This coffee is good all day long!
4,"This is a delicious cup of coffee, not for the weak at heart.  Bam!  Emeril maintains his reputation with this brew.  And the pack of 50 from Amazon is the best deal in town.  We will definitely buy these K-Cups for the Keurig Brewer again and again."
5,"This coffee delivers just what it promises...a strong, bold and rich flavor. If you're a fan of Starbucks coffee, you should enjoy Emeril's brew!"
5,"If you're looking for a good strong cup of coffee from your Keurig brewer, this is it! Nice and strong, but not bitter. Much better than any of the samples that come with the brewer. I highly recommend it!"
2,I paid for 100 k cups but received only 98! This is the second time this has happened.I didn't think such about it the first time. Now I wonder if this happens often or even all the time.
3,"We're really enjoying our new coffee maker, trying different types of coffee. This one wasn't our favorite. We figured from Louisiana it would be stronger, but it wasn't. We're going to keep trying others, looking for a favorite."
2,"I don't know what it was about this Emeril's big easy blend, if perhaps there was a hint of chicory, but I really did not enjoy this style of coffee people k cup whatsoever. Something was just off about it. I would try other flavors instead."
1,Coffee tasted bitter and burnt.  Didn't like the 1st cup; kept open mind; 2nd cup not any better. Wish I could return the remaining 48 cups.  One star for fast shipment.
1,"I am sure that this coffee tastes good, but I am not sure I will ever get to find out. Each cup I insert into my Keurig busts open when it is brewing.  I don't think the seal can withstand the heat, and so it opens up and oozes grounds into my coffee! YUCK!!"
3,"Love the k-cup coffee maker and this strong coffee, but the k-cups from this order leak. The seal comes loose so coffee grounds come through around the edges, giving my coffee an extra undesired crunch."
1,I ordered a 50 pack of these k-cup and the coffee it self probly good but the seal on everyone of them breaks during brewing and every cup is full of grounds.. ugh and there not returnable !!!!!
1,"These Emerils Gourmet Coffee, Emeril's Big Easy Bold, K-Cups for Keurig Brewers (Pack of 50) are defective!!! Almost half of them blew the tops off in brewing and filled the coffee mug with coffee grounds, and had to throw away. WILL NOT BY AGAIN!!!"
5,Very good taste strong to make a 8 oz  cup.  Green mountain you need two k cups to make a 8oz  the medium strength
5,Wonderful bold flavor. Really gets me going in the morning. I've tried about a dozen other K-cup coffee flavors and this is my favorite.
4,Coffee arrived in a few days and it is fresh.  Great price for what is a great cup of coffee.
4,"I was afraid of bold because I think of bitter starbucks coffee but this was great.  It is strong and bursting with flavor in a good way, not bitter at all.  I got a sample with my coffee make and went out and bought a box."
5,My wife loves this coffee.  She won't drink any other brand.  I don't like it because it is too strong for my taste.
4,"Arrived on time.  The flavor comes through, which is important when using a K-cup.  It is bold, and sometimes slighly acidic.  It doesn't taste as smooth as the Newman's Bold."
5,"If you like weak, diner coffee, this is not for you! But if you enjoy the boldness of Starbucks, this comes close. We're hooked-- fantastic flavor! The decaf version is good too."
5,Excellent bold coffee with full flavor. Keeps our office staff and clients happy. First timers always compliment the great coffee no matter how they take it. Thanks Emerils!
5,"This coffee is bold and strong, just how I like it.  If you don't like bold/strong coffee, this is not for you."
5,"Not just a name (Emeril's), this was a pleasant surprise the first time we tried it.  You will not be disappointed if you like a bold-flavor yet smooth experience."
5,My husband loves this rich bold coffee.  He drinks it every morning without fail!
1,"Very very bold coffee.  But that isn't the problem.  I like bold, this just tastes horrible.  I was able to try this flavor because it came in a sample pack with my Keurig.  I will not be buying ever.  I wasn't even able to finish my cup."
1,"Coffee was good but every cup broke during use, making a mess inside the cup and out, will not purchase again."
5,"This makes a nice robust cup of coffee without being bitter or tasting scorched, just a good coffee taste. Its not overpriced; and will please most anyone you serve it to. I will be buying this again, pleased with this purchase."
5,If you like dark coffee this is a good one. I tried a sample with my new Keurig and<br />fell in love with this coffee.<br />I found the best price through Amazon.<br />My order came quickly and will order again from this company.
5,I made purchased this coffee a number of times.....this is an excellent value for a coffee with an excellent taste......will certainly purchase again
4,I have found Emeril's Big Easy Bold coffee to be one of my favorites.  I prefer coffees dark and bold and this fits the bill! Very good product.
5,"While my husband and daughter have tried several different k-cup coffee choices, their favorite, hands down, is Emeril's Big Easy Bold. The added chicory gives it the home-grown flavor of New Orleans and blends well with the boldness of the coffee. Give it a try, you may like it too."
5,"I love the Emeril's Big Bold K cups.I get my money's worth from them .My brother likes it straight ,<br />I like it a little weaker ,so I can get 2 cups out of it,saves me $$$$,when I get them on special at Amazon."
3,Not the best nor the worst.  In the middle of the road.  Slightly bitter finish.  Bold brew smell but flavor is somewhat lacking.
4,This coffee is pretty good. One of the better Keurig coffees. I've tried many of them and a lot I find to be weak. This is more comparative to a brewed coffee.
5,I bought this product for my son who is in grad school. He said Emeril's K-cups were the best tasting ones he has tried so far. I will definitely buy them for him again.
5,"Great coffee it remindes me of the coffee i had in New Orleans when i was stationed there in the navy, You had to go to Jackson square to get some good coffee after church."
5,"I give this coffee five stars, but I like a really bold bitterness to my coffee.  This coffee is super flavorful, but if you like your coffee medium roast then you should go with another flavor.  This coffee will wake you up, if that's what you are looking for."
5,This coffee is the best K cup we have tried.  It is big and bold and we love it.  STill looking for variety in the bold area but this will be hard to beat.
5,"I don't drink much coffee from our Keurig machine, sometimes tea.... but my wife is the coffee aficionado, and she thinks this stuff is the best coffee ever. Take that, you lucky so-and-so!"
4,Enjoy this coffee very much good flavor one of our favorites.  We like stronger coffer and this fits the bill.
5,i am very particular about dark roast.<br />This brew stands top shelf with tullys french roast and starbucks pike roast<br />good good good
5,"Great rich cup of coffee, smooth and bold flavor.  Best K-cup I have found so far.  Low price as well!"
5,"I have been buying this for over a year now and love it,<br />the best wake me up coffee I have tried .<br />Try it just once ,, you will not be sorry..."
5,"Tried a new coffee recently and have to say that Emerils Gourmet Coffee was just what I expected, a dark bold flavor that I love."
3,"I have ordered several different brands of coffee on Amazon.  This is a great coffee, but the box was short two units and there was one cup that was ripped and empty."
5,"Got this for Christmas, I'm addicted.  Just ordered another two boxes. Coffee tastes great, gives out an aroma that fills the whole house. I've gotten great  reviews on my coffee since I started using my new coffee machine."
5,"We have bought this product a few times now, and we love it!  Will be ordering again soon.  Have also sent it as a thank you gift."
5,"<a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B004M5W7YQ"">Emerils Gourmet Coffee, Emeril's Big Easy Bold, K-Cup Portion Pack for Keurig K-Cup Brewers (Pack of 50)</a> If you enjoy strong coffee like i do, this is a great coffee. Priced right and you get fast shipping. Try this and enjoy!"
1,All but a handful of the shipment were defective.  When brewing the water flowed through very slowly and large quantities of grounds were released into my cup - Gross.  The only way to use them is to empty the contents into a reusable k-cup.
5,"Emeril's Big Easy Bold is my favorite. It is full flavored and robust yet smooth, and never bitter. Shopping online is hassle free and convenient!"
5,"Big bold coffee flavor and taste. Smooth and rich and dark, A very good Keurig K Cup. Excellent prices on this quanity.I will be buying this again"
5,This is our all-time favorite coffee blend for our Keurig coffee maker! We subscribe to a regular shipment of it so we never run out!
5,I have used Amazon many times for K-cups for my Keurig and every time I am satisfied with both the price and the item that I get.  This is just another case of a great coffee at a great price!
4,"Have tried a half dozen K cup flavors, and have found this to be the most substantial. Many of the others are very weak brews."
1,"The containers explode at the end of the brewing cycle. The grinds fill the cradle that the K-Cup sits in and it is messy to clean up. Newmans and Tilly's work fine, but Emeril's does not. I have a Mr. Coffee powered by Keuring coffee maker."
5,"Emeril's Big Easy Bold is my husband's favorite. It's not easily found in grocery stores, so I was excited to order a box from Amazon!"
4,"The product is very good.  We had tried it at a relative's house and enjoyed it.  However, the case of 50 that we ordered contained only 47 cups.  Not worth the hassle of sending it back; however, I would hesitate to order this item from Amazon again."
5,My husband Loves this coffee he says to so smooth.  He loves the extra zing it give him in the morning.
5,All I can say is BAM! The flavor and the buzz is totally Emeril. I drink enormous amounts of coffee daily (trucker) and this is by far the best I've tried in a quick K cup format. The cups work fine (no grounds) and the price is right.
5,I like the robust flavor of Emerils coffee and it has enough flavor to give a good cup of coffee in the 10 oz size of my keurig machine
5,"I love this vendor ~ the price is very reasonable and I get free shipping.  What more can you ask, great price and it being delivered to your door.  Also, quick shipping, thank you!"
5,I purchased this product as a gift. Shipped as promsed. Recipient loves this coffee and will not use other brands or flavors.
4,"excellent coffee in a pod! would buy it again. price point is good. fast delivery. packaged well, love the convenience of the whole concept!"
5,"Watch out, these brownies will make you gain weight.  The fudgy ones are especially great.  Easy to make."
5,"This brownie mix is great, we have tasted so many brands and so far Pamela's products (brownie mix, bread mix, pancake mix, and chocolate chip cookies) are the best, I really recommend this items!!"
5,"I usually use two packages of the mix and bake the mix in a 9 X 13 cake pan.  It is easy to mix up and can be frozen for eating later on.  Of course, they must be refrigerated but travel well for on-the-road meals.  I highly recommend this mix to the chocaholics out there!"
4,"We've eaten Pamela's Brownie mix for years.  My kids actually prefer it now to wheat brownies. And now at Amazon, buying by the case AND via autoship, its the best price I've ever found!"
1,"The ingredients shown on Pamela's website did not show any corn in the mix.  The package lists corn derivatives in the mix.  My grandson is allergic to corn, so this is a problem."
5,This is one of the best gluten-free brownies that are just as good as or even better than the brownies that are made from wheat. Excellent treat for people who cannot tolerance gluten. A must buy for the gluten sensitive person
5,I bought several baking goods from Pamela's and all of them are really good!! It shows that healthy doesn't have to taste bad.
5,"These brownies are a hit every time I take them to an event.  Everyone is always surprised that they are gluten-free. With a bit of gooey, chocolate icing, they're extremely decadent!"
5,Superb! These are amazingly good. I'd eat them even if I could eat regular wheat flour based brownies. The egg free option is superb too which is also important to me.
5,"Pamela's chocolate brownie mix is my favorite GF brownies to date. Very chocolatey with chunks of chocolate throughout. They are easy to mix, and a fast treat."
5,"Pamela's brownie mix does everything I want it to do.  Pamela""s prcoducts now replace all my previous baking products and even my grandchildren love them.  Great consistency and value."
5,"Pamela's products can't be beat. I've tried other gluten-free products and none have been as good.<br />Not only the brownies, but all of the products from this company have<br />proven to be flavorful."
5,"And I LOVE brownies. I got this gluten-free mix so my husband could eat them, and I couldn't believe it when I tried them. SOOO good, just how a brownie should be. Chewy, fudgey, with chunks of chocolate, yum! Best brownies ever, gluten-free or not."
5,"This brownie mix doesn't bake at 7000 feet altitude, but it works super well as chocolate/chocolate chip cookies. Makes 24."
5,"You won't miss the gluten in this mix...in fact, your non-gluten-free friends will love this as much or more than their favorite brownie recipe.  These bake up moist and rich, with none of those chemical ingredients you will find in other commercial brownie mixes.  YUM!!"
5,These gluten-free brownies match up with Ghiardhelli's Triple Chunk Brownie Mix.  I add chocolate chips to give them a little twist.  My whole family enjoys these.  This is the best gluten-free dessert I've found.
4,Granddaughter requires gluten free so thought we would try this - big success - actually tasted pretty good.
5,this popular desert was gone almost as quick as it came out of the oven..everyone loved..Pamela's you're the best!
3,These brownies had that 'off' taste that you sometimes get with GF baked goods.  I prefer the Bob's Red Mill mix.
1,The wheat free brownie mix is not to my liking.  I won't be reordering. I'd rather not eat chocolate than to eat these brownies.
5,I love licorice but soft types have wheat as a main ingredient.  I was so happy to discover these subtly flavored hard candies available in the U.S.
5,"Love Calif Natural venison dry.  Prior to this, had to run to vet for anal gland problems.  Since switching to venison, no more problems. No more loose stools or anal gland cleaning.  Thank you Calif. Natural.  Dog loves it and I'm real happy."
4,"I ordered this for my father, who likes to use tea for his digestion. He's been very pleased with the flavor and the freshness. The packaging does an excellent job of preserving the tea, and our order has been refilled promptly."
5,"These chicken wrapped rawhide twists are difficult to find. The ones from Staples are only available in their store, not online, and don't have as mush chicken wrapped around them as these do. Highly recommended."
5,"My pom loves these wraps, I have already reordered them.  They are just her size and she really enjoys<br />ripping them apart."
5,My dogs really love this item.  They are hard to find.  One of my dogs enjoys eating just the chicken jerky off the stick.  The other gladly finishes eating her and his unwanted portion too.  A nice treat for them.
5,My cat had periodental disease. He had to have teeth removed. This dental diet helps keep his teeth and gums healthy.
5,I TRIED IT IN 2003 AND SINCE THEN - I USE IT EVERY DAY ! THAT'S THE BEST THING MONEY CAN BUY !!! HUGE AND ULTRA-MULTI HOT !
1,I like hot stuff but this thing was a killer.  I put a tiny dab of it on a toothpick and was sick the rest of the day.
3,"Package arrived on time and in one piece, but after eating some I noticed the flavor of some is stronger than in others.  About 1 in 5 has no flavor and I end up spitting it out.  If they all tasted as good as the few good ones I would have given 5 stars.  Maybe I just got a bad batch."
5,I don't know if I love the jokes or the candy the best.  Both have made me a hit with my great grandson Caleb.  Captain Caleb and I sitting on the couch watching Doctor Who and eating laffy taffy..what a great treat.
1,"I'm drinking my first cup right now.  The rest of the package is going in the freezer for emergency use only.  It is NOT full bodied, it is NOT full flavored .... maybe they think dark roast refers to color?  Don't waste your money on this one!  Blech.... weak brown water..."
5,We had the Lava cake last night and it was wonderful.  The chocolate flowed out of the cake as pictured!  And so easy to prepare.  The ramekins that came in the kit are a great little dish to have for other desserts too!
5,"I thought this product was superior in every way.  Packaging, color, taste, etc.  Will buy again as soon as needed."
5,Every year I look forward to when these bad boys come out. The peanut butter to chocolate ratio is perfection! Perfect size for sharing (although I have a hard time with that) I usually cut into sections and eat over a period of a few days.
1,"The packaging was okay on the Easter eggs but they were all melted and the chocolate was white, very grose! We couldn't even eat them we had to throw them away. It would have been the same as throwing the money in the trash."
4,The picture doesn't show the very good detail in the decorating.  Very nice and very tasty.  A tad bit over priced but for the special occasion it was worth it.
5,I ordered this as a gift for a friend and he loved it!  The designs were well done and the chocolate taste was great.
5,"My 8 month old loves the food, especially the pumpkin (squash) and sweet potato.  I like it because it's easy to mix, organic, lightweight and environmentally friendly.  When she is older, I will use it in the other foods as well.  It tastes like ""real"" food, not ""baby food"".  It smells better too!"
5,The peas are a BRIGHT fresh looking green color not anything like a store bought peas would be. My son loves all of the flavors. The apples do get clumpy and kind of hard so it's a little harder to mix those up the the other flavors. Over all I LOVE these.
1,I should have read more closely.  This is dried packet of mix that can be added to yogurt or milk.  Not what I wanted.  I am going to have give them away to so someone with a 'new eater'.  Missed the mark for me.
5,"This is a rare and wonderful honey that I first sampled in Idylewild, CA. I am NEVER going back to supermarket honey! Star Thistle honey is definitely a must try especially if you use it in teas since the flavor is mild and has no aftertaste!!!!! Awesome flavor!"
5,This bbq sauce is the best I have ever purchased. It comes highly recommended. We made ribs using this sauce and were very impressed. They were better than most restaurants.
5,This is the best deal for this kind of coffee I have found yet.  Our Local stors including WallMart do not always carry it and my husband will only drink this kind.
1,Im not buying anything from british delights. Or amazon ever again.their portions are wayyy tooo small.goodbye rip offs :) both companies Do not care about their customers.its kind of sad:(
5,Had trouble finding these after easter. These are the best jelly beans ever. The packing was slightly different but the jelly beans are the same.
4,I did nto like this coffee. its too dark for my taste but my brother loves it and swears by it so for him it was great! for me not so much!
5,This is the only place to buy Black Silk. The shipping was Xtra fast. This is the best coffee I have had. Amazon is great & highly recommended.
5,Robust and aromatic from the time you pop the container top to the last drops in the pot.<br /><br />Great flavor black or mixed with cream and/or sugar.
5,"This is the first time I tasted the silk, try it...you'll like it! really great looking for more."
5,My Wife is a coffee snab and she loves Dunkin Donuts Coffee and she feels Folgers Black Silk is a very very close second!!!!!!!!!!!
5,"I love this coffee.  I have used Folgers Coffee for many years but this one ""Black Silk"" is the best yet."
4,"We like the smaller cans because you don't have to worry about all of it going stale. This has a good flavor and the containers are the right size to create storage bins for nuts, bolts, nails, jewelry or whatever fits."
4,"I usually prefer a strong coffee without tasting bitter and this is it. Also, another plus,is the price even though the size is slightly smaller the taste is BIG and delivered to your doorstep. Save your time and gas."
2,"I don't know what kind of coffee these people giving this stuff 5 stars were drinking but this coffee honestly tastes like the beans were roasted to the point of charcoal.  Out of 54 people that I work with, only two like it.  I think somebody is getting paid to give this stuff a good review."
2,The product arrived in good shape and in a timely fashion.<br /><br />I did not find this product to have the taste or aroma that its name and roast would warrant.  I would not likely order this product again.
5,Almost hate to let people know about this one. One of the best lemon cakes I've ever had. The fact that it is gluten free is just a bonus!
5,"It is hard enough to find gluten free items for regular meals... but even harder when planning a backpack trip.  This item is light-weight and makes a great, gluten-free corn chowder.  Recommended."
5,"My dog has trouble digesting too much rawhide, so bully sticks are our bone of choice.  Not only is this more economical than buying them in the store, they were delivered very quickly and my dog's tail couldn't stop wagging when they arrived.  I highly recommmend them."
3,"My dogs love this product; however, it's too smelly and too expensive for me, their owner to purchase.  I'll take smelly or expensive, but not BOTH!<br />CB"
5,"My friend sent this to me and now I use it for everything! It has the texture of real cake!!!!!!!! No longer feeling deprived.<a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B004HYW5JO"">The Pure Pantry Baking Mix, All Purpose Gluten Free, 1.4-Pound</a>"
5,I have many of the Pure Pantry products. I bought them at Jimbo's and have been very happy with them.
5,All of The Pure Pantry mixes are fabulous.  Gluten free doesn't mean taste free!  This baking mix allows me to make all kinds of breads and muffins I can also use it as flour when I roll out dough.  I only buy Pure Pantry mixes now.
5,"My boyfriend uses this stuff religously, in everything!!! Just be cautious it seeps thru in your frig. an burns the heck outta anything you touch!! Max 1 cap full will set ya on fire!!Oh! And the next day stay near the pot.....cuz if you think it's hot goin down it'z even hotter comin out!!!!"
4,"This is the single hottest thing I've ever ingested! The flavor wasn't very appealing, though. If you like it hot, fine...but if you like it PAINFULLY HOT, this stuff is for you!"
4,"Without words! the best of the best. If you like hot sauce try it.<br />Is really  hot, spicy and delicious."
5,We use the buddy fruits as a quick add-on-item to kid's and adult's bagged lunches at our house.  No one ever brings one back home--we consider that a victory in the kid's lunch boxes.  Greal low calorie count and much better than a cookie for dessert. Check out our blog at [...]
5,"My whole family loves these. They are tasty and convenient and the packaging is recyclable to boot. Perfect for in the kids lunch and to take in the car, as they are not messy like a cup of applesauce and a spoon."
1,i was disapointed in this salt. since it is a truffle salt i expected to taste at least a hint of Truffle but didnt. if you want a really good Truffle flavored salt order Fusion Black Truffle salt it has a wonderfully strong aroma and great flavor!
5,This product has been excellent for our dogs for the past four years.<br />Keeps their energy up and their health is great.
4,This jerky tastes pretty good.  I bought some from the grocery store prior to purchasing in bulk.  The small packages are convenient and each package has an O2 absorber to prevent molding.
3,"I am always looking for value and I buy in bulk.  This product is a great product with great taste, but the price is too much.  You are better shopping this item at a local grocery store."
5,I love the 100 calorie packs. They limit my intake so I don't eat a huge bag. Bring them to lunch with me to get a good amount of protein. I like how they are smaller bite size pieces of jerky. It makes it easier to eat and not so gamey. They are delicious too! A little pricey though.
3,"pieces are small, not like a regular piece of jerky.  It had a good flavor though.  After purchasing them here, found them a lot cheaper at local warehouse store."
5,it's a very nice little snack. Good quality and excellent taste. It's in fact cheaper to buy in amazon than in glossary market. I love it.
2,"When i read that these were ""long lasting"" i was hoping for a chew that would take my take more than 2 minutes for my 9 month old chocolate lab and 9 year old lab to chew. Not happy with this nylabone purchase!"
5,I can eat this straight from the can.  It needs no other additives to make it delicious!!
4,My pets love these Bully Springs. Apart from the smell and the price (Should be lower) they are great treats for the dogs.
5,So I bought these to give them to homeless people on the street. They seem to really appreciate it. Nice thing about M&M's is that they don't melt into goo when you put them in your pocket.
1,"By the time these little rocks tell you that your plant needs water, your plant will be dead.  Great idea and just didn't pan out."
5,"Very affordable product. Works well and is quite accurate! I like that it is very discreet and you have enough for 5 plants. No reason to spend money on expensive moisture meters. This is a cheap and effective product, 5 starts!!!"
5,"Taste is very good.  With any gluten free product, the texture is different. i feel the taste more than compensated for that.  Lots of choc chips and nuts.  Would definitely buy again."
5,"This is one of the few products I would buy even if I could have wheat products.  The cookie is not a ""soft"" type cookie.  I've had good luck with shipping, they are packaged well from the factory, and amazon does a fair job in packaging for shipping."
5,"It's hard to find crunchy items in the gluten free world, this hits the spot and doesn't melt in the summer heat of Vegas. Thank You"
5,Pamelas Chocolate Chip Walnut Cookies were both affordable and delicious.  Everyone that I gave one to simply raved about the taste.
4,"Great cookies. But BEWARE. If you buy them from the warehouse (at reduced rate), the expiration dates may only be 30 days away. Pretty short for six boxes of cookies. I bought cookies through the regular site and the expiration date was 6 months away."
1,"I really love the oatmeal raisin cookies I ordered from Pamela's, but these were really bad - they were dry, tasteless and seemed old.  Going back to Pamela's oatmeal raisin - if I can find them."
3,"These cookies were better than the lemon ones, but still not as tasty as some of the other ones."
4,"Pamela's Chocolate Chip Walnut cookie  are wonderful as a final touch to  a good day,  as a pick-me-up when I need one, or as a bribe that I use to make myself finish an unpleasant task.  Sometimes I have one just because it's there and so am I.<br /><br /> P.S.  My family loves them, too."
5,"These are the best gluten free cookies I have eaten.  They are wonderful.  I have to hide them from the kids across the street, or they would eat them all."
4,This product is excellent for folks with food sensitivies...gluten/wheat free...it satisfies...the urge for chocolate...and it tastes yummy...recommneded very highly
5,These are great considering they are wheat-free and gluten-free. I was surprised how good they were. They are sweet and the chocolate chips are both chocolaty and soft. The walnuts are a great addition to this cookie as well. See the photo I posted.
1,I am not trying to be mean or anything but these cookies very very dry and tasted very unpleasant.
4,Have always loved apple butter not just in PB & J but makes a great glaze for pork and also a touch to apple salad or just plain apple.Have always trusted the Smuckers brand for quality and taste.
4,This is a very good product.However due to poor packaging by Nutricity two bottles got broken.This had to be discarded by the courier company and the remaining ten bottles were repacked by them.Nutricity refuses to entertain any claim as they say that the time to make a claim has elasped.
5,"Cheap white rice has no flavor and has no substance.  This is good, organic white rice with a nice nutty flavor.  It's worth the price if rice is the bulk of the dish you are preparing."
5,I love this rice - it never comes out sticky.  I purchased it here because it is a speciality item at our local grocery store and therefor expensive.
5,We just love this rice at our house. Perfect. It is what Basmati is supposed to be. We will order often.
5,"I found out about this rice about 3 years ago, and i have'nt went back to regular rice since. The flavor is second to none. It might be a little more expensive than regular rice, but it's worth it. You won't be dissapointed."
5,This is great tasting rice! have been using it for a while now use to purchase it at the supermarket! This is better now we don't run out with the shippment! We are big rice eaters in our house and the kids love it!<br />It's even going on vacation with us with the rice pot :)!!
5,"Tasty and flavored, perfect to cook or make flour, excellent for general purpose. 100% organic, no gmo! Try it you won't be disappointed"
1,"For anyone who is a seasoned Sencha tea drinker, this is tea is a total dud.  It barely tastes anything like fresh, high quality Sencha nor even older dried sencha leaves.  I had to throw this in the trash because it's simply dreadful."
5,This is by far the best green tea I have ever had and at a price much lower than that of a local grocery store.  I have ordered more.
5,i don't know why one reviewer said the orange flavor was overpowering.  i find it has an excellent taste and nice orange aroma.  love the tea and have been drinking it several times a day.  i'm buying more.
5,Smoothest green tea yet....good all day
4,"I could do without the cocoa in the batter because it makes them look burned when they are not, but very tasty."
5,This Pamela's dough produces an excellent-tasty cookie.  This gluten-free product is kind to my sensitive digestive system.
5,"I recently found out that I was allergic to Wheat, Gluten and Milk and I love baking, so I was very excited when i found Pamela's Chocolate chip cookie mix. My friends didn't even notice the difference! This is a wonderful mix so good and easy. I highly recommend this mix!"
5,"This cookie mix isn't just the best gluten-free mix, it's the best chocolate chip cookie I've ever had.  Easy to make, they bake in no time and make a perfect cookie everytime.  I will choose these over a homemade variety without question."
5,these disappeared so quickly i barely got a taste! easy to make and taste great! Taste very similar to non-gluten free chocolate chip cookies I used to bake
5,"This is a great product for people wanting gluten free cookies.  It goes together easily and the cookies are delicious!!!!!!  Add some walnuts or pecans to the mixture if you like nuts, that tastes great too."
5,"These cookies are every bit as good as their gluten counter part.  Simple to make. Delicious and much cheaper than purchasing the already made, pre packaged gluten free cookies."
5,These are by far the most delicious gluten-free chocolate chip (chunk) cookies out there. Easy to make as well. Super fast shipment from the seller and packed nicely. Easy transaction. Buying more today.
5,So good that even those who do not need gluten free will also enjoy them.<br />That is the ultimate complement for a gluten free product.  Well done Pamela's!<br />I have these on subscription with Amazon.  Great deal.
5,Best cookies ever!  Every time we have an invite to a party I am always asked to bring these cookies.  In fact if I don't I get a lot of grumbling and disappointed comments.  So I never go to a party without them now :-)
5,This cookie mix is by far the best I have ever used and tasted for Gluten free products.  Everyone loves them and I will continue to order them.<br /><br />Vicki Brejla
5,"<a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000ROKSSS"">Pamela's Products Cookie Mix Chocolate Chunk -- 13.6 oz</a>These are the best Gluten Free Cookie Mixes.  I bring them to church regularly and people really look forward to them!  Love them and they are highly requested."
5,Dear Pamela ...dont know if i should say THANK YOU?? lol or shake my fist at you..these cookies ..easy to make ..Gluten Free...are Way too yummy ..they have to be considered dangerous :)..so we shall leave it as a THANK YOU PAMELA..Highly recomend trying these
5,"I love these cookies. They aren't grainy and are really moiste and tasty! They are easy to make and enjoy. I used an extra amount of chips, but you wouldn't need to. They are good on their own!"
5,This is a great cookie for young and old alike!  You can hardly tell its gluten/wheat free (well maybe my taste buds have changed!)  It is very easy to make and delicious.
5,These taste like the real thing!  They are delicious!  And very easy to make!  My whole family loves them - even the ones who aren't gluten-free (like me)!
5,"After trying a number of other chocolate chip cookie mixes, my husband and I were beginning to wonder if any gluten, wheat and dairy free cookies could taste better than sawdust. Pamela's Chocolate Chunk Cookie Mix was a revelation! Tastes as good as regular chocolate chip cookies,,,,delicious!"
5,Love this wrap.  Better than most for can fit a lot of veggies on it and it's only 100 calories for a full sheet.  Gald to see Amazon has it for bought it at BJs discount store on a temporary membership and notsure if we will get a full one.
5,"I have been buying this product for at least 8 years. The butter flavor is true, the popped -corn is fluffy, & just the right amount of salt+ the fact that it is 94 fat free.The 2.9 oz. bag is about 225 calories. This is the only brand I will buy and I have tried many, many brands."
5,"my dog loves these, they are so expensive to buy individually. these are great and clean the teeth. i hold onto one end and rotate it around, kinda like a toothbrush so it cleans her teeth!"
5,"I give each of my three dogs one a day and they just love them, and I have noticed that their breath is better and their teeth and gums are clean. My vet even noticed how great they looked. I will continue to buy these for a long time."
5,"My dog loves these dental bones. They take him a while to eat and he spends a lot of time chewing them up. Be sure to supervise your dog while he/she eats these, just in case. They seem to be good for him and make him happy!"
1,the Bookdinders (old original) snapper soup was just aweful...threw all remaining cans in trash. No one in the family liked it. Waste of money
5,"Best Blue Corn Tortilla chips I have had, not hard. Always have these in the house. :)"
5,I was kinda worried at first how the kids were going to react. They loved them and couldnt get enough. They were just as described and very yummy! Great product!
2,"These weren't great. They have a funny aftertaste. I probably wouldn't buy them again. Texture wise, they were great though."
5,I buy these all the time. They taste great. I've tried another organic brand & they tasted stale (but were not out of date).
5,"Excellent Pine Apple Juice, but the price is higher on Amazon . Whole Foods sells the lakewood Pine Apple Juice at $5.49 and when on sale  $ 4.49 compared to the Amazon Price of $6.99. No reason for a $1.50 per bottle Price Difference"
5,"Great for rehydration,  taste is unbeatable by any other pineapple juice I've ever had.  I will bw buying this again"
5,Good chocolate. You can actually taste the orange citrus flavor. It complements the chocolate and doesn't dominate the flavor.  Great treat.
3,"The Galil Roasted Chestnuts are OK if you absolutely need a substitute for fresh chestnuts. I found that they were slightly mushy and didn't have the crunch of real chestnuts. I would use them again if, and only if, I couldn't get fresh and needed to make a specific recipe."
5,"And these are great.  Just like fresh roasted off the grill without having to peel them.<br /><br />Order lots of them because 3.5 Ounces add up to about 10-12 chestnuts.<br />These are great for eating out of the package or using in stuffing, etc."
4,"definitely don't taste like the freshly prepared chestnuts. they've got their distinct own taste, but still delicious on their own accords! note that they are made in china."
5,"We first saw this product in Costco but being Costco was 25 miles away we ordered through Amazon, received the chestnuts the following day,  I eat a package a week.  Love the texture and taste."
5,"These have a fresher chestnut taste than others I have tried.  For people who are looking for a healthy snack, chestnuts are probably closer to brown rice than they are nuts.  They are pretty low in fat.  I would recommend these."
4,"I like this product, not bad taste at all plus good value.I like it.<br />Mailing is fast as well.: )satified with what i got."
5,"These are a great deal, yummy and healthy too! I give them as a snack/ desert for my kids to have at school, serve them with dark chocolate sauce as a desert or eat them while watching TV.  Love my chestnuts!"
5,I bought Gefen and it sucked I shoulda stuck with Hesse! Subscribe and Save I'd rather buy bulk it sucks when I run out! I'm addicted and even lost lbs munching on these!!!!
5,"no...they don't taste exactly like fresh roasted chestnuts.  but, eh, they are not bad at all!  i like 'em."
5,These are very tasty. They are as good as you get without roasting your own....
5,I love chestnuts and can go through the whole box in a week if I don't stop myself. I love them. I just pop them in the microwave for about 30 seconds and its a great snack
4,"I've bought different types of packaged chestnuts.  They all tend to be less sweet than fresh chestnuts.  This one is also not as sweet as fresh chestnuts, but it IS sweeter than other packaged chestnuts.  In addition, it's organic.  However, it's a bit pricey.  Thus, 4 stars."
1,"Ok, I read the awful reviews but I am such a chestnut lover that I knew I would not have a problem. This product looks like a chestnut. BUT the taste and texture is AWFUL and I gagged. It should not be allowed for sale. DO NOT BUY!"
1,"My initial taste of these roasted chestnuts were positive!  However, after a week, the remaining chestnusts in the ziplock bag turned slimey and is covered with an unappetizing goo.  I had to throw away the rest of the bag for fear of spoilage.  DO NOT BUY!"
1,"Order full box, tastes horrible. No one will eat it, brought it to the office, few people tried it and spit it out. Bought it because of reviews, hopefully no one else buys it."
1,This Galil Roasted Chestnuts are undoubtedly the worse product I have ever ordered from Amazon.  I literally threw them away.  Not edible by me.
4,This is a very good source of fiber with good taste and texture that even picky eaters enjoy.
5,"Whole wheat orzo is pretty hard to find in the stores.  I try to eat only whole grain pasta, bread, etc.  I love the texture and it is delicious.  I don't mind buying 4 jars at once because dried, sealed pasta keeps for so long."
5,"It's hard trying to get the other members of my family to eat healthy, so I was glad to find this Orzo.  While most whole grain pastas are hard and grainy, this has a smooth texture and is very tasty. I've added it to my subscriptions!"
5,Great pasta but can't find it at any local stores so I continue to order from Amazon.  It always arrives quickly.
5,Could no longer find Rice Select Whole Wheat Orzo at the grocery store.  Amazon had the best on-line price.  This orzo is a delicious and healthy pasta!
5,"Hard to find whole wheat orzo in supermarket, happy to find it on Amazon. Tasty in hot soup, as a main or side dish with vegetables, seafood or meat. Can also be used anywhere you would use couscous, such as a cold salad ingredient."
5,"This product is delicious, and healthier than regular orzo.  What I especially love is the packaging:  the jar with screw-top is much more convenient for storage and allows for easy measuring."
5,Such an excellent source of fiber.  One of my favorite pastas to fix for salads as well as a side dish with entrees.
5,The order came in good time and we've been enjoying it since.<br />Regina Immarco
5,"Outstanding! This difficult to find product is tasty, and is much less expensive than whole wheat orzo found only at specialty shops!"
5,"This Whole Wheat Pasta is a wonderful addition to so many dishes.  In addition to the fact that it tastes so good, it also adds few nutritionally sound calories to a dish and is so satisfying!"
5,"This whole wheat pasta has delicious taste. It's not easy to find in stores around, but from time to time Whole Foods not far from home has it. The safest  way not to run out of Orzo is to order from Amazon. I'm glad I found this ""source"" of Orzo."
5,"This product is not only a healthier version of the regular orzo, but it's very, very tasty!"
5,Great pasta.  I try to limit myself to whole wheat products.  This one is easy to make and has a nice flavor.
4,The whole wheat orzo tastes pretty good and it a good substitute for regular pasta if you are watching your card intake.  It's also hard to find whole wheat orzo in a supermarket so online may be your best bet.
5,This product came so quick I was really surprised it was 1 day or so and I recevied it!
5,I like to cook with whole wheat orzo rather than regular and my store stopped carrying it.  This product is great.
5,"This is a delicious whole grain product--what you see is what you get.  Boils quickly, has great flavor and no additives.  Buy it now!"
5,"Whole Wheat Orzo is quite difficult to find in my home town, I was pleased to find it here on Amazon.  This product was shipped quickly and is an excellent value."
5,This product is very hard to find at the grocery store. I bought a 4 pack. It came within a few days . I was very pleased with the whole transaction. Thank you for carrying this product. I will shop for it here again :)
5,I love this Orzo!  I was unable to find this in the grocery store so I was really happy to find it on Amazon.  I tried it tonight for the first time and it's delicious.  I will definitely be buying it again!
5,"This is awesome.  Amazon is the only place I have been able to find whole wheat orzo.  Unfortunately, it does not seem to be available any more.  I'm heartbroken."
5,"I found this product to have great texture and taste. My wife uses it to replace ""traditional"" Orzo in all her recipes."
5,This pasta is great tasting and so good nutrition wise.  I highly recommend it.
5,"Very delicious, fresh ,  home made taste and perfect on toast and crackers.  Highly recommend this seller and product, fast shipping, too!"
1,Jelly did not set well and as a result is almost liquid. Taste is not that of Strawberry. Do not recommend purchase.
5,Can't believe these are sugar free! Dissolves well in water and tastes just like the Hawaiian Punch I remember from when I was a kid!
5,Received the sugar-free Hawaiian Punch packets quickly and in a secure package. I am very pleased with my order. I plan to order more of this product.
5,This is my first dendrobium - and my first orchid that is mounted.  My order arrived quickly and the plant is young and healthy.  Looking forward to it blooming.  Thanks.
5,Ever wonder why veggies at restaurants taste better than they do at home? Vegetable Magic may be the reason. We eat a lot of catered foods and are always asking for recipes and Chef Paul's name comes up a lot.
5,"I love this seasoning. I use it on all of my veggies, it has a slight heat to it but it's not hot. A great disguise for veggies you don't particularly like. A+"
5,"I put it on fries, broiled veges, in stir fry, in Asian cooking.  I buy it by the 24 oz. can and I DO GO THROUGH IT"
1,Paul Prudhomme makes great seafood seasoning and pork and veal seasoning. I found the Vegetable Seasoning to be too spicy.
4,Love this tea. Has a very mild flavor but that's enough for me. Received some as a Christmas gift a few years ago. Been addicted ever since. Just can't find it in a store any more. Have to order it here.
1,As hard as I tried I just couldn't smell that french vanilla aroma.Next time I'll stick to Lipton. Definitely not a good buy.
5,"I find this Balsamic vinegar to be great in cooking, salad dressings, and drizzled over fruits, cheeses, and veggies. It has a very good flavor that compliments many dishes."
3,"I sent this to relatives who are quite fond of this Wisconsin treat - as I am myself.  They said it was good, but I found the shipping cost too high.  The cheap price draws you in but the shipping is too much."

4,This peanut butter did not work for its intended purpose. My dog still enjoyed it. Would recommend to other dogs.
5,Very nice product for those wanting to enjoy the pleasure of lasagna but are on a gluten free diet. Great alternative.
5,I use the Crystal Light Lemonade mix  with Sugar free Tang (one tub ea) with a gallon of water and 4 Tbsp Sweet N Low to make an excellent sugar free orange drink. No other mix gives this excellent results.
5,"Great flavor and love the texture too, but don't overpay.... $8.99 is crazy. The product can be found for much less."
5,"I bought this because my local international market was going out of business. I wasn't sure how the quality of this was going to be, but the pods were in great shape, no impurities, and aroma was intense. Would highly recommend this if you can't find any quality ones nearby."
2,"I bought these seeds in the hope they would be what I'm used to.  I'm sorry I did.  The seed pods are EXTREMELY small, they're a re past prime, and somewhat bitter than normal cardamom.  Disappointed with this product from this seller."
5,"I made Chai tea - as well as a home made chai ice cream and just a chai milk without the tea + cloves, star anise and a few other spices.  But you have to have the cardamom pods and these were wonderful."
5,"The cardomoms where very fresh , the shipment was very early and the package was also good and the aroma is also nice"
5,Our local Indian restaurant always uses cardamom pods in their rice and I LOVE it!  I decided to start using them when I cooked at home but couldn't find anything but ground cardamom.  I was delighted to find the pods here and was happy to find them reasonably priced.  I will order again!
5,"These cardamom pods were very fresh and aromatic.  I have been keeping them in a ziploc bag to keep them fresh.  The amount and quality of cardamom you get from this seller is excellent.  I would highly recommend, as I could not find green pods in stores!"
5,I bought this product for my daughter for christmas. It came pre-grown and moistened in its container. She was very happy!
1,Item arrived promptly but was not as described.  It did not come with gift box packing and the plant had only 3 blooms and 1 was dead.  I requested to return and was told a replacement item would be sent.  I has yet to arrive and more than 30 days have elapsed.  Would not recommend this vendor.
2,"This was not what I expected, tiny plant, followed instructions exactly.  Fly Trap never matured to potential. After 10 days appeared to collapse and by 21 days was dried out."
3,"The plant dried up to nothing , it's dead ! I am trying every thing to bring it back. But no luck yet."
5,came fast and the work just as they said thay would.  thank u we tryed everything to get rid of the roaches and this the only thing that got rid of them highly rekamened.
1,"Initially, I was not happy with this product. After contacting the vendor they remedied the problem and I am happy with it now."
5,I love this tea. This is a wonderful chai blend that's good hot or iced. I use it in my iced tea maker. It's a big hit with our family. Buying it in bulk through Amazon is far more cost efficient than trying to purchase them as single boxes in a health food or grocery store.
5,"I have tried many brands and types of tea and this is one of the best. It has a very spicy taste and is refreshing. I believe you can not go wrong purchasing any Good Earth tea, but this is probably their best."
5,I love this tea.  I don't profess to be a tea connoisseur.  All I know is that I love the peppery undertones and the blend of spices they did.
5,This chai is more flavorful than the Stash black tea chai I had ordered before. Also has the bonus of being organic. Can recommend the Good Earth brand  basically across the board. Almost all of their teas exceed expectations.
5,I love these trail mix bars. They are delicious and healthy and the price is great. To be able to get them delivered each month is a wonderful thing! I am a big Subscribe and Save fan. Shipping is free and delivery date is easily managed.  What a great idea!!!
5,"This is, by far, the best granola bar I've tried from Kashi. The bar is chewy and you can really taste the fruit/nuts. It has 4 grams of fiber, 6 grams of protein and whole grains. I feel like I'm eating something good for me! The sugar is 6 grams and I don't find it too sweet at all."
5,"Super tasty, great consistency and hardy bar.  The tartness of the cranberries plays a great balance with the nuts and grains.  Perfect 140 cal snack."
5,"These are by far the best bars around. They are not too sweet, are crunchy and tasty and I will be coming back for more and more!"
5,"They're still sweeter than I'd like, but they taste less like candy than any other bar I've tried, so they're my favorite. They store well, too - you can carry them around in your bag or car and the constant temperature changes aren't a big problem for them."
5,"My son is 10 months old and adores Fruit Medley by Gerber.  There are very small chunks mixed in so your baby can start to chew and get used to more solid foods.  Fruit Medley is a mix of peaches, grapes, pineapple, banana, and orange.  A great start for babies beginning to eat more solid foods!"
3,A nice blend of several different fruits. This stage 3 food was tasty. Not as thick as some other stage threes and there are no bites or chunks. It is more like a thin custard. My son always loved this.
5,Rarely find the baby fruit I used to make a Baby Food Cake so ordered it fom Amazon...came very promptly and now I have plenty to make several cakes.  Good deal!  Pat Thompson
5,"I recently received my shipment of Nairn's Organic Oatcake Crackers. They are by far the best I have tried yet. The crackers are crispy, fresh and great with just about anything you want to top them with. My new favorite in the oatcake category! Thanks."
5,"I love these, and all of the varieties that I've tried.  And, not that it's relevant, but I have been to Scotland a few times."
5,These yummy crackers are hard to find. Glad amazon has them. They are sweet without any added  sweetener and they make a great snack by themselves or with dips or veggies or fruit.
4,"This variety is vegan, according to their website. I'm not sure I would recommend buying in bulk if you haven't tried them before, but they are quite tasty and I WOULD definitely recommend trying them! ;)"
5,Found these in Scotland and fell in love with them.  I was a bit disappointed to find out this type isn't gluten free.  Will order those next time.  Delicious with a bit of soft cheese.
5,"These crackers are like eating oatmeal.  They can seem be a little dry at first compared to other crackers, but they're to be chewed well.  It's not like eating an airy cracker, it's like actually eating something solid.  My 2 year-old granddaughter loves them as well, it's a healthy snack for her!"
5,"I liked them.  Nice taste, no added sugar or ""flavorings"".  The reviewer who did not like them might prefer to stick to ""crisps"" (potato chips)or larded up sugar ""biscuits"" (cookies)."
1,I have spent a lot of time in Scotland and I could not swallow these- dusty and dry- I threw them out
5,We love this organic flour.  It bakes up nicely and is easy to work with.  And the price here on Amazon with subscribe and save is reasonable.
5,"The colors are darker than on the picture, but it wasn't a big deal to me... They arrived in time for my event so I was happy."
5,"I finally found a source for gum balls to load into my old penny gum ball machine.  now it is more than just a twenty pound curiosity sitting on my desk.  at a penny a shot, though, it surely won't make me rich!!!"
5,Red Mill Gluten Free Oat Bran fulfilled my expectations. It is an excellent product and I shall definitely order again....
5,Why put that other chemical garbage in your body when the pure original tastes this good.  The price was considerably better than the price at my local grocery store.  I ordered again after I checked local prices so I would have some to store in the pantry.  Yummy.
5,Yummy syrup at a great price with auto-ship program.  This is the best price on organic maple syrup I have been able to find in my area.  I appreciate the auto-ship program.  We use this syrup on pancakes and waffles and as sweetener in other items such as ice cream and baked goods.
4,"<a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0013E21V8"">Highland Sugarworks 100% Organic Grade A Dark Amber Maple Syrup, 32-Ounce Jug</a><br /><br />This product is very tasty. It goes very well with pancakes, waffles, and french toast. I've also used it in preparing many dishes and baked goods."
5,"We used to make maple syrup for our own use until it became too much work.finding this syrup was like coming home again,it tastes good and just like our own from years gone by."
5,"The syrup is organic and pure maple syrup, it tastes great and is about 1-3 dollars cheaper than thre store syrup that is not organic plus no tax - so all and all you can't beat it."
5,"Great syrup for pancakes and oatmeal.  Good consistency, great flavor, and best price for organic syrup I've seen anywhere. Definitely recommend."
5,I love this product. I use it every morning on organic waffles. I also put some in my tea. Buy some. You will like it.
5,"It's a little runny, but could not taste better.  I highly recommend this product to anyone looking for a wonderful alternative to the cheap, unnatural crap they sell in grocery stores (Mrs. Butterworth, I'm looking at you)."
5,This maple syrup is just fabulous.  The taste is so delicious.  Just a fabulous product!  Will definitely buy it again.  Thanks!!
5,Highland Sugarworks syrup is the most delicious syrup ever.  The entire family loves it.  Rich and not too sweet.  Perfect!
5,"This maple syrup has been entirely satisfactory and delicious.  Because it it organic I feel good about using it in cooking, drizzled on pancakes and to sweeten our morning oatmeal."
5,"Real maple syrup is a must, and this syrup is fantastic!  The flavor is deep and rich, just the way real syrup is supposed to be!"
5,"This syrup is the mayor of Flavor Town. Great, arrived unsmashed. If you're tired of pancakes, try taking shots of it or snorting it. Just kidding about the nose syruping, but I help but take a sip of this every now and then. Good buy."
5,Tastes great however I wish I had the B Grade as it has more maple flavor to it. My friend got the B grade.  Mine is really great for eating on food but the cooking took some of the taste out
5,We have enjoyed this maple syrup a lot and are reordering more. It has a great taste and is a perfect combo for waffles!
5,The price is right when you use subscribe and save and it is absolutely delicious!  My whole family loves it.
5,There is nothing better than 100% maple syrup on your pancakes and waffles and this Highlands Dark Amber Maple Syrup is Fantastic !!!! Will continue to buy at this great price !!!!!
5,I felt that the product was outstanding. Its addition to my breakfasts was a welcome boost of energy
5,This is about the best tasting maple syrup I've ever bought and well worth the price.  It is extremely good quality and has a rich but not overpowering flavor.  This is my brand from now on.  Enjoy!
5,I'm a repeat customer for this product.  It is a quality syrup at a great price!
5,This syrup is delicious.  Real maple syrup is so rich---you can never go back to the fake grocery brands.
5,"I found this on amazon so much cheaper than getting it in the grocery store and oh soooo good!!!. I'd never in a million years put the corn syrup on my pancakes that Aunt Jemimah calls Maple....yuk!!! Real Maple, now that's where it's at!"
5,"Our family loves this syrup!  I love that it is organic, because of all the chemicals they use to make regular 100% maple syrup.  It really is good and I love the price.  I buy it every month!"
5,Highland Sugarworks 100% Organic Grade A Dark Amber Maple Syrup is a choice I'm glad I made. Its among the best maple syrups I've ever tried and its organic! I would recommend it to anyone...and have!
5,This syrup is great.  It is pure maple.  It is just like you get in the nice places in New England.  Excellent taste.  Clear and beautiful.
5,"Great price on very good maple syrup.  We own a bed and breakfast (the Grice-Fearing House B&B in Elizabeth City, NC) and we serve a lot of maple syrup.  Arrived very quickly, too!"
3,I like supporting smaller family owned businesses and also the great prices on amazon but this syrup doesn't taste like maple at all to me. I might as well have bought generic corn-syrup based pancake syrup at the supermarket for $3. So I'll try a different brand next time.
5,"The taste of this is sooooooo good. You must indulge in pure maple syrup, you will never go back."
5,"pure smooth not sugar sweet, best for the price since Sams club stop selling syrup"
5,"This is a wonderful product at a wonderful price!  Great tasting and the size is just big enough but not too bulk.  Also, I appreciate that they ship to APO/FPO addresses."
5,"This is just an amazing syrup. We have tried a number of organic syrups, and this one is extremely tasty. Has a strong maple flavor and is a bit darker than others. This is exactly what we wanted. The whole family enjoys it."
5,goes well with pancakes or as a sweetener or flavor in baking.  We like Coombs as well.
5,"Great syrup.  Tastes really good. I actually saw this same syrup for $35 at the health food store... So I think its a good deal, too.."
5,I liked it. Good experience. Gave as a gift. Used one myself on Xmas morning with the family. Good product.
5,I love this syrup on my pancakes and belgium waffles!  It has a wonderful maple flavor.  My only complaint is the price..20.00 is a lot to pay for syrup and that's why it only gets used for special occassions!
5,"I bought this for doing the Master Cleanser. Alas, this was not the cleanse for me and I only lasted about 18 hours on it.<br />However, I discovered this wonderful syrup! It tastes great!"
4,"For the lovers of not-your-store-bought syrup, Highland's offering is as good as it gets. A bit pricey but worth the extra bucks for one of the better maple syrups available."
3,"This syrup is runny and I'm not used to it's taste. To be honest, it tastes like medicine to me. Maybe it's supposed to be this way, but I'm not used to it. I will recommend it to others who may be used to such taste and texture, but will try some other brands in the future."
1,"Received my syrup broken, was packed very poorly. After salvaging some it tasted almost similar to a cigar. After reading the reviews i thought maybe it was just me, but i didnt bother getting another to try it."
4,"Very good maple syrup, definitely one of the best I've had; but, as all maple syrup, a bit pricey."
5,"Great product!  Actually, this order was a free order, because the previous order arrived with the bottle open."
3,You can find similar grade maple syrup at Sams or Costco for much less.  The product is great (5*) but not happy with Amazon's pricing (1*).
3,I purchased the Maple Syrup on line due to the savings. We only use real Maple Syrup and if you stick to Grade A then the only consideration is the price.
5,"My cats love this cat food! It is so much easier for them to eat as it is so much easier for them to chew. I have older cats and this is so much better for them. I can't get the larger bags of food at the local feed stores, so I order from Amazon, as I have 3 cats."
5,"My 12 year old cat loves this food and seems to be shedding less since switching to this food.  All of my cats are on Royal Canin products, it's a high quality brand."
5,My vet recommended this years ago for my cat who has a digestive tract the size of dental floss. Always got at Pet Smart. Cheaper on Amazon and delivered right to my door.
5,My cat is a very picky eater. This is the best price around and the best food too! MY Cat goes GAGA over it!
5,Excellent cat food for mature cats and an excellent value.  For $1 more you get twice as much as buying it at a pet store.
5,When i want a very good medium roast i reach for Starbucks House Blend and when i want a very good dark blend i reach for Starbucks Verona.<br />Both full bodied coffees. Even the aroma is tantalizing!
5,I personally loved this popcorn. It really is addictive! Came onto Amazon to see if I could get it in bulk b/c my local store started selling it in 2 pack boxes vs. 6 packs and I think that's ridiculous. So happy to be able to buy a big box!
3,"After a fairly decent experience with the grape version of this same candy, gave the lime flavor a go.  The flavor is fairly light and only a bit tart.  More like smarties than the intense sour flavor I'd have preferred.  Still, decent enough, and sugar free."
3,"Great tasting, small in size like a ""Smarties"" candy. Made with Xylitol. But there's the fine powder from pulverized candy moving in the tin."
4,"I'm not as fond of the lime flavor as the raspberry and citrus.  They are shaped like Smarties candies, but more crumbly.  The lime has the firmest texture of the flavors I tried.  Nice bright flavor."
5,I've been ordering this oil for quite some time and I still think it's the best EVOO I've ever tasted!!  Fruity aftertaste and delicious on the front of the tounge as well.  I'm sticking with this oil for as long as I can get it!!
4,"Flavorfull, rich, perfect. I will definitely order this product again. Arrived in perfect condition, even with the large glass size."
5,Finally found this products. I like it very much.Hope can get more different kinds of chips from Calbee.
5,I really like the Pamelas Products Whenever bars. They have a chocolately coconut taste and not too sweet which is great. Only 8 grams of sugar. It is filling and I would order these in the future.
5,These were so good. They tasted like oatmeal cookies with coconut. They are rather small and for the price that might not fly with some people. But you pay for healthy these days.
2,These taste really awful. I've tried plenty of choc chip coconut cookies but these are barely edible. My guests weren't delighted when I asked them to try these. Don't recommend.
2,"I wouldn't buy these again. They are way to sweet, not fling, and do nothing to curb appetite.  Not sure what I expected of these but I would not buy them again.  There are far better products out there for the price."
3,"Soft cookie lump with a very light coconut and chocolate taste. I found the texture a little too soft and the taste on the bland side.  It was filling as a snack, but lack the I want more to my taste buds."
3,"These bars have a very good, chewy texture that's enhanced by the chocolate chips. Since they only have 2 grams of protein in a 40 gram bar, I wouldn't consider them a meal replacement, but if you're looking for a gluten-free snack, these soft cookie bars might fit the bill."
5,"Love this Oat Choco Chip Coconut bar. Soft, tender, delicious! The best ""oatmeal"" cookie ever! It is a treat, dessert at the end of a meal. Great for sweet tooth!"
5,Pamela's definately makes the best tasting gluten free products.  Great flavor and texture compared to other companies which so often lack flavor and just crumble.
5,Delicious snack bars and very handy to keep around.  Good price to order a larger quantity.  Tried one of the other floors which was also very good!
3,"It has an interesting texture that most people might find to be off-putting. Plus, as far as bars go, it is not all that filling. It also leaves your mouth feeling sort of chalky and full of oat kernels."
5,"These bars are simply delicious. They dont have that ""gluten-free-I'm-missing-something"" feeling like most bars that are GF.<br />They have the perfect amount of chocolate and coconut,etc. Im hooked."
5,"Great snack on the go.  It tastes like a real treat, even though it seems fairly healthy.  Tasted fresh and wholesome, but also indulgent. I would buy this regardless of its attention to allergy sensitivity."
5,These are so delicious you will struggle to stop at just one.  Tastes like a freshly baked cookie.  And so good for you.
4,I think the title says it all.  The ingredients aren't exactly what I would choose.  And the texture is a bit odd (a bit like smooshed raisins).  But it did taste really good!  And the nutrition info fits within my diet.
5,"I loved these, that they didn't trigger my blood sugar was just a benefit, the actual product is amazingly good. Wonderful taste, consistency and portion.<br /><br />Highly Recommended"
5,"Low Sodium, Low in Cholesterol. Less empty calories than candy & can make a quick decent breakfast. I would buy them again."
5,"These were a pleasant surprise...You know when you are looking around for something to munch on and you don't want another Triscuit or a Potato Chip or even something two sweet or two dry?<br />This is it!<br />These are just moist enough, great flavor...right on time...wish I had one now!"
4,"<span class=""tiny""> Length:: 5:41 Mins<br /><br /></span>Live taste-test featuring two fans who eat gluten free."
5,"These bars are a perfect, healthy snack for satisying a sweet tooth. They're moisty, chewy, and just sweet enough. They don't contain corn syrup and you won't miss the wheat or dairy."
4,"This snack was tasty and seemed to be healthy. However, I would not rate it as being special or see myself making it a ""go to"" energy bar. Right now I prefer Clif Bars and PowerBars."
5,"We discovered this salsa on vacation last year. I'm SO excited to find it here on Amazon, so we can get it again. It's absolutely delicious, and it doesn't have any chemical ingredients, something we ALWAYS look for! Definitely worth every penny!"
5,These pancakes are the best.<br />there 100% whole grain so they are healthier than enriched pancakes and you only need to add water.<br />Good deal for the price so buy!
5,These are even tastier than the original flavor! Works great in belgian waffle maker too! Why are they not priced right and available by subscription???
5,"THere's nothing else I can say. This mix is awesome. It's good without adding anything but if you add extras like vanilla or cinnamon, this mix is unreal."
5,"I must admit, I was a bit skeptical of all the 5 star reviews. Today I made some waffles with the mix and OMG!!! Best waffles I have ever had! Can't wait to make pancakes with it. I am quite surprised at the flavor profile for just adding water. This will become a staple in my pantry.."
3,Pancakes are okay - nothing spectacular - doesn't make as many as box indicates (yeah I know weigh the mix not measure it but it is fluffy) but the thing that bothers me is the overwhelming vanilla smell - it isn't something I want in a pancake that I will be topping with real maple syrup
5,"My wife has always said I am the ""Pancake King"". Now I am ""The Pancake Emperor"" thanks to the best batter there is."
5,try this product. the best pancakes ever you will never go back to regular pancakes. tastes great easy to make. and good for you. love them.
5,This pancake mix is the best and easiest mix I've ever tried. You will be hard pressed to find a better pancake you can make at home.
5,"I love the pancakes this mix makes! You just add water and you have great, healthy pancakes! Most the time I add blueberries...even yummier!"
5,"ABSOLUTELY LOVE THIS MIX - THE BEST ""HEALTHIEST"" I HAVE EVER HAD.  TRIED ANOTHER AND AS ALWAYS CAME BACK TO THIS BRAND - NOTHING LIKE IT!!!"
5,These pancakes are delicious and healthier then regular mixes. Very Filling all 3 of my children loved them. I daresay once you go Kodiak you never go back.
5,We used this mix for our Easter breakfast at church.  We fed 150 people and got rave reviews.  Everyone LOVED the pancakes and came back for 2nds and even 3rds.  This is the mix we will have in our house from now on!
5,My husband came across Kodiak flapjacks when he was traveling West a few years ago.  It's not a product we can find around us and we were excited to see that we could purchase through Amazon. The buttermilk and honey version is highly recommended.
3,What I like about Assam tea is the specific flavor that distinguishes it from all other teas. High blood pressure forced me to try a decaffeinated version. I found the resulting tea disappointing: It lost a real lot of its flavor.
1,came with an expiration date of 1 month!!!!<br />amazon need to not send out bad products or not sell them at all
5,"This is the best seafood/fish seasoning I've found.  Sprinkle it on any kind of seafood or fish for a nicely seasoned flavor - not salty at all - if you want salt, you'll have to add it separately - just really nice herbs."
5,I haven't tried a bad seasoning flavor yet.  These are wonderful.  My favorites are Vegetable Magic (not just for vegetables....makes delicious omelettes) and Pork Magic (saute centercut pork chops in olive oil and sprinkle with the Pork Magic).  My kids LOVE it.
5,"Have used Paul Prudhomme's Seafood Seasoning for many years. Although I have tried others, nothing compares to this one. I have used it only on fish."
5,"Still one of the best Cajun spice mixes around.  And at this price it makes no sense to buy individual bottles.  Such a good bargain that we've bought cheap spice bottles, filled them, and given them away to friends and family."
5,I  have used this product for years.  It is wonderful on grilled fish.  A little less salty than the Redfish Magic.
5,I love this seasoning. It truly is magic. I eat fish all the time and this brings out the flavor. I feel like a television cook when I use this stuff. I no longer worry about running out of Old Bay as long as I have this in the house..
5,Use this all the time.  So happy to be able to get a large canister.  Our store only carries in 2.2 oz jars.  Will only buy online now.
5,"Our local store stopped carrying this item so we ordered in bulk via Amazon.  The price is right and the taste is great.  My wife is the one who needs gluten-free, but I don't mind being gluten-free as long as this is the brand we use.  All others are mushy and tasteless."
5,Great old time soda I drank as a kid that is no longer sold in Massachusetts. Was great to find it at a good price!
5,"I've read that many people find this pop hard to find, but it's always been around in Minnesota! It's one of my favorites, next to Coka-Cola! It is very sweet, it tastes like a sweet carbonated fruit puch. You just have to try it!"
5,Grew up drinking Tahitian Treat down South. Sadly they don't sell it here in Seattle  So glad I'm able to get my fix!<br />If you've never tried it maybe you shouldn't. They are addictive  Quick tip...Put it in the Freezer before drinking!
5,As a young girl this was one of my favorite treats! As the years passed it became unavailable. I am so glad I was able to find it here on Amazon. My family and I can once again enjoy the great taste of Tahitian Treat!!!
5,Excellent product. Haven't seen it on store shelves for a long time.  I wish we could get it here locally.
5,"Tahitian Treat was ""the soda of choice"" when I was growing up.The closest thing to it is Albertson's Fruit Punch soda.The only people who know about it are the 70's & 80's generation if you was in the south and midwest as far as I know.They still sell it in Dallas."
5,"I was so happy I was able to find Tahitian Treat online.  I've been looking for it forever.  I first had it at school in Ohio, but never saw in the stores and I really can't find it in Northern New Jersey anywhere. I really enjoyed it and it brought back great memories from when I was younger!"
4,So it must be good.  He never lies to me.  Even Skizip likes it and all he drinks is Strawberry 'protein' shakes.
5,I loved cheese crackers as a kid in the 1940s and 1950s.  They changed them and I hadn't had a good cheese cracker for years and years.  Then I discovered Back to Nature Crispy Cheddars Crackers.  I'm hooked.
5,These taste like the cheddar crackers of years gone by. Back before all the bad additives were added to good food.<br />I dare you to eat just one.Great tasting cheddar crackers.
5,These taste like the cheddar crackers of years gone by.  Back before all the bad additives were added to good food.<br />I dare you to eat just one.  :)  Better buy several packs.
5,Great tasting cheddar crackers. Too bad the idiot manufacturer has stopped making it. This is your last chance to buy some before the supply runs out.
5,My wife of 50 + years is English so English such as Bisto is a staple in this household and a treat!
5,"This product cost the same directly through the company that is does on here.  So who ever wrote that review is incorrect, it's the same price!!"
5,"I have purchased several of these.  They make the best stock for soups, sauces, etc.  Makes the very best chicken mushroom and rice soup! Highly recommend."
5,"This is an excellent alternative to sugar. It tastes better than sugar or any of those artificial sweeteners. This nectar has a low glycemic index which is good news for diabetics. I can't wait to try cooking with this. I use it in coffee, on pancakes, french toast, just about on anything."
5,This Agave Nectar is fantastic. It tastes great in everything and on anything. Whenever we give our toddler waffles or pancakes for breakfast we use this instead of syrup. He loves it!
5,This Agave Nectar is great.  I use it to sweeten my tea and other beverages.
1,"I won't say watery, but much thinner than every other honey I have ever eaten. Good news, No waiting for honey to travel to top of jar! It just runs right out!"
5,I have been using this honey for quite some time. Honey does have different flavors. Not all honey labeled clover honey tastes like clover honey. This one does & comes at a great price
5,Chef Pauls Blackened Steak Magic is awesome.  I never BBQ a steak without it.  Buying 3 small bottles will more than pay for the 20 once canister and you will have over twice as much.  This seller has a very good price and was very fast on shipment
2,"I bought this a few years ago and really liked it.  They must have changed the recipe because this just tasted odd, sort of medicinal."
5,"Seasoned Roasted Pretzels, only product that works is Paul's Blackened Steak Seasoning. Yumm<a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001EPQQD0"">Chef Paul Blackened Steak Magic Seasoning, 20-Ounce Canisters (Pack of 2)</a>y!"
5,I Love this blend on Chicken for a Caesar Salad. I used to start thinking about it 2 hours before lunch. Serve the Chicken hot drizzled with fresh Lime juice. Awesome! I must have had it 20 times at Checker's in Calistoga.
5,This product is great it really works. I have lost a total of 15 pounds in two months wihout exercising. I reconmend this product to everyone.
4,"I love this product, it helps keep things moving!  I use it twice a day afternoon and evening while dieting.  A great product for helping maintain your weight."
5,This product works very well. It taste great. Its a nice touch to the end of a day. PLEASE USE AS DIRECTED! PLEASE!!!!!
5,Works great for me and also help me with my weight.  I don't like the drink as much but I drink it as needed.
5,"I have used this product in the past and was highly satisfied. It works very well. I would just caution first time users not to make the tea too strong or your results may be ""too good""."
4,"I like this product, but I wouldn't use it daily. I learned this the hard way. It is stronger then you think!!!!!"
5,"I have been using this tea for a few years now, and I drink the full 2 cups every night before I go to bed.  It begins to take effect the next morning.  I gave a bag to a friend to try & she loved it as well, she now orders it online."
5,"One must know that this dieter's tea helps mostly by moving your bowels along.  Be careful at first, or it will be unpleasant!"
5,"I don't use this tea for dieting but more so for a natural cleanse to keep the body free of harmful toxins.  It is very effective have used it for years!  First time users may experiece cramping but, after awhile they cease.  Great Effective Product!"
4,A lot of tea for the price... ...no sweetener needed... The product works better than I expected it to. I also didn't realize how much I was ordering. I am enjoying this product. Has very good taste.
5,"This tea has a superb taste.  I actually look forward to drinking this tea with my dinner.  Now that it is summer I drink is as an iced tea, but this is also a very delicious hot drink too!  I use splenda and fresh mint when I brew it.  Fabulous!"
5,Reality strikes.  I have been drinking this tea every night for 10 years !  It is the best thing to keep me on the straight n narrow!
3,i got this tea hoping it would be better than my dieters delight china slim tea but it isnt. it does make you use the bathroom but not enough for you to feel cleansed for that particular day...i have no choice but to finish thus package but i will be going back to my regular tea afterwards
3,This tea is ok but it's not nearly as potent as the original product that was available 5-10? Years ago.
5,I was very happy with my order.  It arrived on time and as described.  Thank you!!
5,"it is hard to find this blend of various flavors in a store. Love mango flavor. Though, chocolate mint is really good."
4,"This is a nice selection of decent quality teas.  It was a little heavy on Chai varieties for my taste, but I loved all of the other flavors."
5,I found out that I really like chai tea.  The double chai spice is amazing.  These teas are full of flavor and come fresh and packaged well.
5,This package was great.  My family are huge tea drinkers.  This gives an assortment of teas all of them are full of taste
5,I use the hazelnut flavor to make  my own coffee syrup.  It smells great and tastes great.  It's does a great job  of saving me money on the syrup I was purchasing at my favorite coffee shop.
5,"I really like hazelnut flavored creamers, but I find them too sweet.  I use this extract to make my own sugar-free creamer (with fat free half and half) and it works well."
5,I have been trying all the Entress. This one was very good. Still need to lose more weight. So I am staying with MedfitNY. They don't steer you wrong.
5,"I have tried almost every meal and each one is simply delscious and filling! Have them for lunch, dinner - or even as a snack by the TV - and you know you are doing something good for yourself!"
5,My mom Bee has been a licorice lover for many years. Bee is now 96 and will be 97 in November..She has partial dentures so the hard candy is not only delicious but  the perfect answer. I have to watch her though as she<br />would go through a bag in a couple days if I let her.
4,"I made them for my son who has celiac and he loved them, they were a bit softer in texture but the taste was very good.  I would buy them again for sure, but the price is a bit too high."
5,"I LOVE these! I don't drink soda anymore because I'm trying to be healthier, so when I'm craving a coke I grab these. Perfect coke taste, with a lot less calories and sugar!"
5,"Love the big chunks of apple and awesome cinnamon taste. Tastes like apple pie oatmeal. Great when cooked per the directions for perfect consistency. My 12 year old even loved it straight out of the bag, and he eats it as cold cereal too."
5,My daughter loves this even more than the Quaker brand oatmeal (that has twice as much sugar).  Thumbs up.
5,really great breakfast that i keep at work for when i don't get breakfast at home. not overly sweet and has chunks of apple that are pretty good considering...
2,"It may have 30 fewer calories per packet than the maple-brown sugar instant oatmeal, but you can really taste the missing calories. I can't even eat it hot anymore, the ""apple"" flavor is so weirdly bitter and unpleasant. It makes me hate breakfast."
5,"Awesome product for the price. They are organic, not too sweet. I add some Xyllitol and a little salt to make it taste better. Apple taste awesome. two packs are filling. a definite buy."
4,"I like it, but it seemed to be lacking something.  It was not as good as the Light Maple Brown Sugar.  I do think the serving was a little small also."
5,"Trying to eat a healthy breakfast, but also don't have time? Me, too! This oatmeal is perfect - organic, quick, and delicious."
3,"I like the generous serving of real apples in this oatmeal. However, one packet does not have enough oatmeal for a hearty breakfast. Two packets at a time work best. Not very creamy, which was sort of a bummer, so you really need 2 packets.  but an ok instant cereal."
5,This product is a very health snack for your pup as it is made of 100% beef liver. My puppy does all of his tricks to get this treat. It is a little pricy but the container is large so it should last a long time as long as you don't overfeed.
5,This is 2.5 oz larger than what you can find in pet stores and less expensive. Shipped day the it was ordered and arrived 2 days later with prime.
5,"I have one dog that is a picky eater. I crumble this liver treat into her food bowl and she loves it. If you have a dog that doesn't eat, try this, you won't be disappointed."
5,"Yes, they are a bit expensive but, they are high quality, and pure nutrition.  Good training treat and not too high in calories.  Highly recommend this!"
5,"I have two German Shepherds. I use these as training treats. I also use them when I brush them, which they don't enjoy so much but know they will get treats. We have tried every treat available. These are the best."
5,"Extremely big bucket of yummy treats for training! This is a great value. The pieces are large, but I cut them up into smaller pieces for regular training purposes."
5,"These liver chunks are like crack for dogs. The niblets are magic for training dogs because the critters will do anything for these. Although freeze-dried liver is pricey, you can cut the chunks into tiny chinks and use while training, rewarding, or just saying, 'I love you, my good dog.'"
5,"all natural,dogs favorite treat. Don't give too many because it will constipate dog. My dogs will do anything for these treats!"
5,My dog is not enthusiastic about food.  She enjoys these treats which are light weight and easy to carry.  Number of treats per day must be limited.
5,My dogs have been eating liver treats for years.  We also use the treats for training.  The treats are 50% crude protein so you are getting a high quality treat.  Just make sure your dog has enough water since the treats make  my dogs thirsty.
5,Our dog loves this stuff.  Ground up and sprinkled on his dry food he just gobbles it up.  No additives or fillers no carbs. We also use as a treat.  Best price at Amazon and quick delivery.
5,"My dogs love these treats and I was buying them from the vet at double the price!  Great deal, great service!"
5,My dogs LOVE these treats! Freeze dried easy to throw some in a zip lock bag and take them with you. Wonderful training treats because they're so easy to put in your pocket. Great deal too!
5,My dog loves this all natural treat and the price cannot be beat by any store.
5,"My dog, a little maltese, loves this product.  She knows she will get it as a reward for doing her business on the wee wee pads.  Works every time to reinforce her behavior. I also received the product in a timely fashion thanks to Amazon."
5,"We tried everything including cheese, chicken & hot dogs and this is the only one he will eat."
5,Dogs just love Freeze dried liver and this is a good price for this size container.
5,These Dried Dog Treats are great.  My dog was diagnoised with diabetes and these are a low fat treat for him and he loves them.
5,"Received very timely, and packed safely; no burst packaging.  Really glad that these people make large enough buckets of this wonderful treat that it makes it affordable.  Dogs love these little cube treats, and they are always fresh since they are freeze dried."
5,I have tried several different kinds of training treats from pet stores and they all either made my English Bulldog puppy sick or lose interest. The liver is working great she absolutely loves them and they keep her attention 100%!
5,This is the only dog treat that my terrier will eat. We crumble over his dry food and he LOVES it.
5,"My Westie loves these things!  She loves anything with liver but this one is the best.  Expensive by weight, but well worth it.  The freeze-drying process concentrates the flavor and nutrition:  Susie gives it 5 snouts!"
5,"No waste , even if she is having a  day when she goes on a hunger strike  she always room for one or 2 or 3 of these and the extra powder on bottom makes a real treat on food , Never met a pooch that did not go crazy over her treats !"
5,"This is the ONLY dog treat that my Lhasa Apso will eat. It makes me happ becuase it has NO added ingredients or preservatives, as well as NO ADDED SALT! This is the ONLY dog treat that my Vet approves of!"
5,This is a great treat which all three of my dogs absolutely love!  I am now ordering it regularly and the price is great.
5,This is a healthy and good snack for my dog.  It is a great training produst too.  When you take into account that a couple are all she needs it is a good value.
5,My dogs LOVE this product. They beg for them. They also came recommended by our animal trainer.  My only issue is that I took advantage of the Super Shipper Saver and for some reason it took almost a month to get here. VERY VERY slow shipping.
5,This was the only treat my dog liked during obedience training and it has remained her favorite ever since.  I haven't met a dog that didn't like this treat!
5,My dogs love these treats.  They beg for them and sometimes I sprinkle these treats on top of their food for a special treat.  Also Amazon ships very fast so I get them quickly.
5,product is excellent as a training treat or just an everyday treat.  My dog absolutely loves them.
5,"Its a great product, and our dog loves them.  But I see that Amazon lists some sellers of ""used and new"".....I wouldn't recommend buying these used."
5,He loves the Liver treats and the Lamb treats. They're not much to look at (simple cubes) but he starts to lick his lips whenever he hears me get the can!
5,"We were buying thses from our vet, but they are so expensive. So glad we found them online.  Our dog loves these! Thanks!"
5,My dog loves these treats!  We started using them for training purposes.  The treats of healthy too!
5,"This is one product that my welsh terrier can eat. Sophie has food alergies so I have to be very careful in what I feed her. My other dog Oscar, also gets these treats and loves them. He has no food alergies. This product is just simple ingredients, no additives, and that is what my dogs need."
5,Our Airedale loves the taste of the Beef Freeze Dried Dog Treats which we use for training. It really works
5,I've purchased several different brands of liver treats and this is the best in terms of having good-size pieces with very few small bits and little powder.
4,"My pitbull, Sammy, loves these treats! they are useful for training as well as do not make her breath smell overly bad."
5,I use to buy this at PetSmart...they no longer sell it so I decided to look for it on the internet...I am so glad that I found this on Amazon...My dogs love it... :o)
5,Our dog would do ANYTHING for these treats! Have looked around at other brands...but this is the best.
5,"This is a Delicious treat for your dogs.  I am unhappy with<br />Amazon because we paid for the product, but never received it.<br /><br />Nanci Shea"
5,"These freeze dried treats are our dogs favorite treats.  We've been spending DOUBLE the price I paid for them at local area pet stores (ie, Chuck & Don's and PetSmart).  Arrived promptly, well packaged.  Highly recommended."
5,The Gimborn Liver Treats are by far my dogs favorite treat.  The are a wonderful training reward.  Very good quality.  Just beware your dog will sniff them out from wherever they are hidden in your pockets.
5,My little dog loves these treats. Besides rewarding my dog I crash treats and mix it with medicine. It works great.
4,"Otter and I are very happy with this product. I am happy to have come across this dealer on line, because it was the best deal with respect to cost and convenience."
5,"This product is the same as I get in Petsmart at a much better price. The service was quick and efficient. We use it for our old wiener dog who has some iron deficiencies and it helped him alot, but I am not a vet."
5,"Great product. Dogs love this treat. It's hard to get them to eat only a few at a time. However, this product is pure protein and therefore not great for their kidneys if they eat too many. Limit to a few treats per day."
5,"We have used Pro-Treat Beef Liver, Freeze Dried Dog Treats for several years.  It's our 110 lb. hound's favorite treat and great to use for training. It's a fairly expensive treat but if used properly lasts quite a while. I would definitely recommend."
1,I received all containers previously opened - all seals were opened. On the top of containers was decent pieces of liver and below that were grisley pieces and a lot of powder on the bottom. I will never buy liver treats from Amazon again. BIG RIP-OFF!
3,I bought 21 0z freeze dried liver. Half the container was filled with powder instead of pieces/chunks. I feel I was betrayed by the company. Hence I did not get what I paid for
1,"I selected this company over the other even though the price was higher. I was hoping the pieces would be more consistent in size. It tuened out the container was filled with smaller crum like pieces, worse than the other company's. I will never buy anything from this company."
3,Dogs love these things but `I do feel they are overpriced for the quantity you get.
5,"You asked for my review of this purchase already, I said fast shipping and good product. Do not bother me with these reviews any more, if i have a problem i will let you know. I will stop using amozon in the future if you don't leave me alone."
2,Same price as Dr. Foster & Smith.
5,My dog has never stopped loving these treats for over a year.<br /><br />Service was great and shipping was prompt.
5,"Excellent Product,,My 15# dog loves these things--Turns her nose up at every thing else--I would very much recommend this product for dogs !!Big Plus--There made in the U.S.A."
5,Gold standard for training treats. Have used for 10 years of training. Never met a dog that didn't love them.  Fast easy service thru Amazon sellers.
5,"Finally a treat both me and my puppy like. Doesn't have a strong odor, but dogs still love them. Plus, as a freeze-dried treat they don't make your fingers greasy.<br />A healthy treat that my puppy will actually eat!"
4,Very happy with the product and shipping.  Thanks.  Always like doing business with Amazon.
5,"These are the best training treats you can buy.  My dog is more motivated in doggie class because of these treats than any other dog in class.  He loves these treats so much that he is not very interested in most other dog treats, which keeps life simple."
5,My 5 month old lab goes nuts over these liver treats.  Our vet recommended these as a healthy treat.  Our pup acts like a cat with catnip over these. A big hit. The price and size are excellent and should last a good while.
5,Bought these based on the review and the type of treat. My Peagle puppy loves these more than cheese! Perfect for training and they can be cut up easily so you don't overfeed. Great price compared to other treats of the same quality. Highly recommended.
5,Wonderful treat for training!  Perfect cube size for large dog.  Somew crumbling of product once you get to the bottom; spread on their food for a special treat.
4,My dogs love these treats. The only problems I've encountered with these are the left over powder at the bottom and the sizes are not uniform; many big pieces and many very small pieces (very minor problems). But they are all natural and don't upset my dogs stomachs.
4,My dog can't resist these treats - I can get her to do anything if I have one of these with me!
4,My little pupster loves these things. She is not exactly Ms. easy to please when it comes to food of any kind. These she thinks are great.<br /><br />Betsy
5,Our dog has to have insulin shots twice daily and these liver treats make giving the shots easier and less stressful for the owner and dog.
5,"We usually buy this product directly from our vet, but have a considerable savings when purchased here. These are high quality dog treats that are perfect for training your pups. We haven't had a puppy yet who has refused these and would all but stand on their heads to get a ""liver treat."""
5,"This is the ""all gone"" treat after dinner.  It's the only treat that the dogs work for; and I did run the chance of losing a hand.  They know a new command now:  ""be gentle"" when taking liver treats."
5,"Gimborn Freeze Dried Treats 21 oz Beef Liver is one of my dog's favorite treats, so I was happy to find them in a large size container. I received my order very quickly, and was happy with the service I received."
5,"My dog would do anything for his liver treats!  ...and whenever any of his playmates are out for a walk they drag their owners to our house so they can have a liver treat as well (in fact most of their owners now buy it for them).  It is healthy, a great training treat, and they all love it!"
5,Made in the US---one ingredient and I can pronounce it-100% liver.  My dog loves it. Its freeze dried so does not have a strong odor--overall a great product.
5,I donate this product to the local SPCA dog trainer. He swears by it. He only gives one or two a day to each dog so it last a while.
5,We have a variety of treats for our two shitzus.  Their favorite are the freeze-dried livers.  Nice big container that always has the dogs running when they hear me opening the lid.  Bought two of these.
5,"our dog responds to this more than any dog treat.<br /> We have tried many different treats, but this seems to be the one that is most preferred.<br /> This brand was recommended by our dog trainer."
5,As another reviewer noted...This is like crack for dogs! My dog likes jerky but loves freeze dried liver. The tub may be a but much but is the best value.
5,"I purchased the product to use with training my dogs, as treats, and as a supplement to their dry food.  My dogs love them and best of all they are natural - nothing artifical. A good value for those seeking multiple uses from one treat."
5,These smell delicious and my dogs love them. The big tub is the most cost-effective package of high-quality treats that I've found. (Those chicken jerky things from China are not high-quality.)
5,I've been buying this product for over 10 yrs.  It is a special<br />treat and reward for our dogs - I will continue buying this.
5,"My dogs love this treat. I use it to train them and just for fun. The nice thing about this product is that if you want the pieces to be smaller, it's easy to cut them up without it crumbling apart. Also, it was a great deal."
5,My dog loves these and so do I : ).  No yucky texture or greasy feel such as with hot dog pieces or cheese pieces and no grossness in your pocket or treat bag.  And my dog will do a lot for a taste of these treats.
5,These Stewarts Liver treats are the love of my wirehaired dachshund's life.  Nothing else comes close.<br />I have bought them from several sources and sometimes they are crushed but those fom Amazon arrive in fine condition and ready for munching.
5,i always try to feed healthy snacks. My dog does not always like them as much as less healthy snacks.<br />This is the snack that we meet in the middle about.... actually she likes this the best of all her snacks!!!
5,My dogs love this product and this was the cheapest I could find it any where. Shipped and received as notified when purchased.
5,"My beagle/lab mix is fairly picky with treats, but she goes nuts for these. I've been trying to find something other than chicken jerky from China (after reading reports from the FDA showing illness/death in dogs) that my dog really loves, and these seem to fit the bill nicely."
4,My Dogs love this as well as my Cat..I like this product except the treats start to get smaller about half way down the bin...
5,"There isn't much my puppy won't do or try to do for one of<br />the freeze dried liver treats. Gave one to another Springer Spaniel<br />we met at the beach and now when I see him he races, sometimes<br />a long distance, to great me and get another treat. great<br />training aid."
5,My dogs favorite treat.  They pass up the other treats for the dried beef liver.  I love the fact it is low in fat and healthy.
5,"My dog LOVES these treats.  Great quality, and cheaper than buying at the big box stores.  You really can't go wrong with these."
5,Our dogs love these treats - last a long time - light and easy to give our dogs.  Amazon has the best price for these treats - will always have them in our house!
5,"You can't beat these natural treats. My dogs love them and they align well with their raw diet.  Great value ordering on Amazon too, sell for $12 more at my local pet store."
5,"Great Product, these are my Chihuahuas favorite treat.  I have never had any problems with them except the bucket runs out to fast."
5,This is great! The price is better than any stores around here and my dogs love it! Now they don't mind taking their pills
5,"My dogs love this stuff! They will do anything for liver treats!<br />Be careful, very rich, a little goes a very long way, give sparingly!!!!"
5,These items were delivred quickly and exactly as promised.  Thank you.  Super large container and the pieces were well intact.<br />Thanks you.
5,A very tasty and well made cheese. Quality was as good as any other version of this I've had. Came well wrapped and chilled.
5,I absolutely love this product!<br />As a home-chef I use this product on just about all of my seafood. It adds a distinct flavor that that takes any fish or seafood to another level of excellence.<br /><br />Great for even the most basic cooks!
5,"When you think about paying $4.00 a 3 oz bottle for this... This is a REAL bargin.  If you like fish, bast it with butter, sprinkle Magic on it and grill it quickly...NEVER over cook fish.  You should be able to grill about any fish."
5,I'm from New Orleans but now I live in Michigan so I don't get many chances to have Cajun food. I ordered some crawfish tails from Louisiana Crawfish Company and used this spice to make Blackened Crawfish Tails. Man was it ever good!!
2,"I wanted to like this wine because I really like Bethenny, but the wine just isn't good.  It really tastes and smells like vinegar."
5,"This orchid arrived in good shape.  I was a little skeptical as to the ""blooming size,"" but they were right...it bloomed 9 months after arriving, with 3 big, beautiful blooms...not bad for a first-time bloomer.  And the colors are outstanding!"
1,"I am so disappointed- this product is NOT eligible to return, but the items I received were outdated!  The use by date was even BEFORE I submitted the order, and the seller sent product they should have seen were beyond the best by date- at least 6 weeks before they processed the order."
5,"These are so intensely cheddary, they're addictive. I love them, they are everything I want in a cheese snack, very cheesy without being greasy or tasting artificial"
2,I had so hoped they would be close or better than Cheetos Flamin' Hot but they aren't. They were NOT past the expiration by  3 months but they did taste stale and almost flavorless even though you get a tiny after burn. I gave the rest of the case to the food shelter.
5,"These are the best cheese puffs I have ever had, a sentiment shared by my coworkers and boss."
5,This was my first purchase of any gluten free cheese curls and I was pleasantly surprised by the taste and the crunch.  My husband even likes them and he is very picky about his snack foods. To me they taste better than the other name brand cheese curls and with less fat and calories.
5,"Can not be beat. They are simply addictive. Cheesy, spicy crunchy<br />Our family can not stop eating them You have to order these"
5,forget cheetos! these are the best ever!  same price (or less if on sale) and better for you.  I could eat a bag by myself but the kids beat me to it!
5,I was very satisfied with the price and quality of the product. I could not find these gluten free cheetos in any store so I was happy to find them online.
5,"I try not to each a lot of processed food, but occasionally I indulge. These are the very best cheese crunchies and gluten free too! I have found these at New Seasons in Portland Oregon every once in a while, but wish they were more readily available. Very good!!!!"
5,"The best cheese curl we've found, but we stopped looking once we found these!  Did not think we could consume a case - but, we've back for more."
5,My local grocery store had to stop carrying these because the distributor dropped them. I tried other stores with no luck. These are the only cheese curls that really taste like cheese and don't taste like you're licking salt. I'm so glad I still have a source to get them.
5,"Addictive. IMHO these are simply THE best cheese curls. I used to get them at a local whole foods market. Ordering by the case is a wee bit cheaper, oh-so-convenient and terribly dangerous."
5,"It is an excellent product, the presentation is beautiful and I am very satisfied with the purchase. My whole family loved it."
5,"We have trouble finding this product on the shelves of grocery stores.  What an amazing find!  Our favorite pork rub, in an amount that will last many times, not just one.Thank you Paul Prudhomme"
5,"This stuff is incredible...put it on pork chicken (or any meat really) especially as you're cooking it, and you will love it! It actually brings flavor, not undue hotness."
5,"These chips are outstanding!!  Use in place of tortilla chips with salsa, and you will never go back. Forget the fact that they are healthy, these chips are delicious!"
5,"I was able to try these chips from a food show sample, and I fell in love.  They taste great!  Plus they are much healthier than the average chip.  Definitely recommend this product.  Let's get these in stores!"
5,"Absolutely WONDERFUL coffee...smooth, rich flavor. This coffee gets raves whenever I serve it to dinner guests. No problems at all with the order, came right to my door...what could be better?! A small bit of pure happiness....."
5,Hard to get item in my neighborhood.Good price + free shipping to my front door.Awesome!!!!
5,"This product is way better than some of the pricier brands, rich, deep dark color.  Perfect for the espresso machine you got for Christmas.  Makes beautiful lattes, and they don't cost $4.00!"
5,I received my order quickly and did not have to pay for shipping.  Was glad to be able to buy this coffee online as it is not available locally where I live.
5,This coffee was removed from the shelves in the local stores.  It's a great smooth tasting coffee.  Love it!
5,"I find this coffee to be as good,or better than, the top dollar coffees. It always has a rich,bold flavor.If you like strong coffee with great taste,this is it."
1,"I am a bacon fiend and was very excited to try Baconnaise!  However, after a small taste, both my husband and I found it disgusting.  It tastes very chemically and not so much like bacon - more like smoke flavoring.  We threw it all away."
3,"This is more like a flavored spread than a true mayo replacement, I would not advise using it in Potato salad or tuna fish. It is very tasty as a veggie dip and as an admittedly rich burrito topping."
5,This is a great tasting product!! Both me and my wife love it. I don't know how they did it but it is wonderful.
4,"Baconnaise is so good - it really tastes like bacon, just creamier. I would highly recommend this product."
2,tastes vaguely of bad fish. Good idea but it's a bit off putting. Nothing can replace real bacon plus real mayo.
1,This is the most horrible stuff. Bacon? PLEASE!! I bought the 3 pack and gave 2 to friends. We all threw them away after one taste.
1,"nasty, overly salty, artificial smoke flavor, and simply disappointing. Really does not taste like bacon. Texturally disappointing as well. Instead of the light fluffy experience of mayonnaise, this stuff is runny, gloppy and dense.  Would give it zero stars if possible"
5,"lite baconaise has great flavor does not tast lite, just not as dense as regular baconaise."
5,"LOVE that smokey flavor - very unique!  Definitely worth the purchase, esp as a novelty / can't get anywhere else product!!  And it is LITE!!"
3,"We wanted the Baconnaise lite after seeing the product on Oprah. We looked forward eagerly to the  prospect of that great bacon taste. The decision in our house was 1 for and 1 not so.<br />The taste is there, the ""greasy"" taste was also. I won't buy the product again."
4,"If you are a bacon lover and like mayonnaise on sandwiches, this is for you.  It is great as a dip too.  I have mixed it with cream cheese and it still holds its flavor."
1,"After seeing this on Oprah I thought I would be good. I was not impressed as it has too much smoke flavoring in it, which takes away from the bacon flavor. Sorry that it came in a 3 jar pack; however, I definitely won't buy it again."
2,"Certainly does not taste like bacon, but is good on a cold turkey sandwich.  If you are looking for a smoked flavor spead this is the spread for you.  Wouldn't every buy it again."
1,It had a horrable after taste the first time I had it was ok the next it was worst than the first time I had it and the 3rd time I could not eat the sandwich.It has verry bitter taste
1,Save your money and do not buy this product. Does not even come close to bacon flavor more like a hickory smoke taste. After everyone in my family tried it we all agreed it was nasty(we're not picky either).
1,"Three generations in our home tried this product and unfortunately, none of us liked it."
4,"It has shipped on time with great condition. My friend was satisfied my choice. It is a valuable case. This milk powder is tast good, and my friend's baby love to have them everyday."
5,These are one of my favorite treats - absolutely delicious with a great rich chocolate flavor. No other packaged chocolate cookies seem to even come close.
5,"These Dare Chocolate Fudge cookies are the best tasting chocolate cookies I've found, since the Sunshine Bakery (Safeway) stopped making theirs in the 70s.  Great fudge taste and rich with flavor.  Cookies not too soft and not to hard.  Highly recommended!"
5,These are the best chocolate fudge cookies commercially available.  And the price is way below what you would have to pay at the grocers.
5,This is one our favorite coffees. We buy this over and over. It is a good strong coffee. I recommend it to everyone I know.
5,"since we got our Keurig,We have been trying different flavors and brands of coffee,tea,hot chocolate,and cider. Out of all the coffee brands I have to say that Green Mountain far surpasses all the other brands that we have tried. Great taste and not so expensive that it hurts the budget."
4,"This is the best coffee that I have tried,and I tried many types of K Cups.Wish it could be packaged in a larger package with more  cups and sold cheaper."
5,"This coffee was in our package when we recieved our Keurig. I had never tried it before, in fact I had never heard of it before.  It was so good I never drink any of the other kinds that were sent with it. It was always Maxwell House or Folgers, even Starbucks, but now it is Green Mountain."
5,"Really a great cup of coffee.Rich and mellow, perfect for those who drink their coffee black. All Green Mountain flavors are terrific."
5,My husband loves this Nantucket blend.  He makes it daily in our mini Keurig.  I can barely keep up with his consumption.  Thanks to Amazon - his K-cups are always here in a jiffy.
5,"My wife loves this coffee!  I enjoy it too, but the caffiene gives me a buzz, so I drink decaf.  Fair price, great free delivery (over $25.00)."
4,This is great tasting coffee and my family lives it. They are very picky about coffee and this seems to have the approval of everyone
5,"The Green Mountain Coffee Nantucket Blend is my favorite brand of k-cup I've tried so far. I've tried about 6 different varities. This one is very smooth, has lots of flavor and tastes great with a little milk and sugar added in."
5,"This is one of the best K-cup coffees I've ever had!  It's has a nice aroma, smooth, and rich cup of coffee; love it in the morning."
5,"Since getting a Kuerig Coffee maker for Christmas, I have tries several brands of K-cups.<br /> I love the deep aroma and taste of Nantucket blend the best.<br />It has the right combination of a medium to strong brew blends.<br />I would rate it better than the coffee shop varieties."
5,This is another K-Cup flavor we have on automatic delivery. It has a nice flavor with no bitterness.  I usually drink it in the morning and find it to be very pleasant.
4,Good morning cup of coffee.  Just bold enough.good flavor.  In my top 10 of K Kups as I like variety.
4,"This was a very good buy and arrived in perfect condition in a very timely manner.  Yes, I would order again."
4,"We enjoyed this coffee very much, smooth and rich taste gets us off to a good start in the morning! I'll be purchasing this brand often."
4,"Good coffee and the price wasn't bad.  This is a popular brand and flavor, it was great to be able to get this shipped and didn't have to hunt for it."
5,"I love this coffee, the Nantucket Blend is very delicious. My boyfriend's favorite. The 2 pack is great value. I recommend this!"
5,"Very tasty product, this is a wonderful coffee anytime day or night. Smooth flavor, medium strength, goes great with hazelnut liquid creamer, or any other for that matter."
5,This is just about my favorite coffee as it has a great full flavor and is not to stong. Just right!
5,"Love, love the Natucket Blend in the morning, afternoon, actually anytime.  Just wish it came in larger packs, as I feel like I need to limit.  I'm not a big coffee drinker, but enjoy it when it is not too strong.  Will order again from Amazon - fast and easy!!!!!"
4,"Delicious cup of coffee. This is not the best coffee I have tasted but it is very enjoyable and I have not found one That I do not enjoy. Quick, easy and enjoyable."
4,"Product arrived before estimated time, which was awesome!  The Nantucket Blend is very good if your looking for a medium roast coffee."
5,great customer service... I had this product the next day !! Amazon and this supplier are a great combination. I will buy from this supplier again.
5,"This is a good, moderately bold coffee.  Just enough to satisfy that coffee craving.  K-cups are great and I enjoy ordering from Amazon.com as the product is always shipped promptly."
5,It is wonderful to wake up to in the morning or soothing late in the afternoon. Just strong enough but not bitter.
5,Green Mountain has become our new favorite for our Keurig.  My husband loves it mild flavor of Nantucket Blend.  You cannot beat the convenience of getting it online!!!
5,"This is always a favorite in our house! You can never go wrong with this,even if you drink it black, like I do ,or add flavored creamer, like my daughter and her boyfriend does. Either way it is GOOD !"
5,Nantucket Blend is my favorite. Not too strong yet has that satisfying flavor. I had tasted this blend before so I had a head start on its fine quality.
4,"The Green Mountain Nantucket blend is one of the best tasting Keurig packs I've tried. It's smooth with no bitter aftertaste, great cup of coffee."
5,You can't make a better cup of regular coffee flavored coffee than this at home. I had been trying in every way imaginable for nearly forty years to make that 'perfect cup'. My patience has paid finally paid off.
5,Green Mountain makes a great medium roast coffee called Nantucket Blend.  I checked all over for the best price and was able to get free shipping on my order.  I will order my coffee from Amazon again.
5,"I've tried several and this is my favorite. perfect blend, not too dark.<br />Mild and flavorful just the way I like it. Highly recommend."
4,"I was very happen with my purchase from Amazon.  It was easy, and I received by coffee even<br />quicker that expected.  The price was right, and the coffee is good.  I don't usually like flavored<br />coffee and I am new to the Kerig K-cup world, but this is a good one."
5,I had been trying to find this specific type of K-cup because my husband enjoys it so much but couldn't find them in the stores anywhere so I checked on Amazon and they were not only in a large quantity but much cheaper than buying them in the stores.  I won't do that again! www.amazon.com!!!
5,"I live in New England and like most people from this region, we are hooked on Dunkin' Donuts Coffee.  This brand tastes just like Dunkin's.  This brand sells the out the most in this area.<br />Definately my favorite!"
5,"Every morning when I wake up, I know I am going to have a perfect cup of coffee!!!  It's not too mild and not too strong, just right for me."
5,"This is our fave Kcup coffee! with GM Half Caff coming in 2nd place.  Nantucket is smooth, not bitter.  Good buy :)"
5,"I've tried lots of coffee pods but this is my favorite.  My ""Dunkin Donut"" friends all visit now that I serve Nantucket blend.  It's a medium blend but has a nice coffee quality."
5,I love this coffee and have bought several boxes over the years.  It will be hard to get me to change.  Good flavor not too strong just right.  Fast shipping too.
5,This is my favorite K-Cup Brand/flavor so far.  Nantucket Blend is just right for me.  Not too strong not too weak.  Medium Roast with lots of aroma & taste.
4,"Although I prefer a more robust coffee, Nantucket Blend is a good everyday coffee which I would certainly consider buying it again."
5,"Not too strong, nor weak, nor bitter.  Perfect.  This is my favorite coffee and when I occasionally make some one else a k-cup of Nantucket blend they always love it, too.  Try it, you won't be disappointed!"
5,"We just recently joined the Keurig Craze.  We've tried out a ton of different K-Cups, and this one is by far my wife's favorite.  It's a great medium bodied coffee that isn't too harsh or bitter.  It makes a great base for adding in a flavored creamer, and making a great cup of coffee."
5,This is a very good coffee.  I can drink it black (which is very rare for me) or with the usual cream and sugar.  It is very hard to find a good coffee that you can just drink black and enjoy it.
5,I love Green Mountain Coffee and am happy that is offered in such an array of choices for the Keurig coffee makers.
5,"Nantucket blend is robust without being harsh. I can use it on the largest setting on my Keurig, and it does not taste diluted."
4,"I love this flavor of coffee. I did realize that with shipping, I could have gotten the same coffee a for a little less at the store, so will begin purchasing atthe store, unless some good deals come up on Amazon. It was delivered quickly, and tastes great."
4,"Very good coffee, not too bold, but rich.  Took a long time to ship, so order early!"
5,Why is this so expensive at amazon?  I can buy it locally in a variety of stores for between $10 and $13.
2,"This coffee is extremely weak. It lacks flavor, like drinking a cup of hot water, yuck! Not what I expected from Green Mountain and the name ""Nantucket Blend""."
4,"I love me some kcups, especially these delicious Green Mountain Nantucket Blends.  However, there needs to be a recycling plan put into place, and quick!  Every time I use one of these, I feel bad (until I taste the coffee, then all concerns are washed away...)"
2,"Although the coffee had no reached the expiration date, I felt this coffee was borderline stale.  I'm not sure how far out these products are packed to the expiration date, but wished it would have been fresher.  As these little packets are somewhat expensive, I was hoping for more."
1,"I've tried a lot of different K-Cups and this is the weakest K-Cup coffee I've ever tried. It should not be labeled ""Medium Roast"", it should be labeled ""Warm Water Tasteless"" Roast. Too bad I bought a large box. What a waste..."
5,I can't wait to try some of this coffee because until now the breakfast blend I think is the best but Im going to try some more.
3,I ordered the Green Mountain Coffee Nantucket Blend which I like as a smooth medium roast morning coffee.  I received the Green Mountain Breakfast Blend which is too mild for my liking.  Three stars for the coffee received. I won't order again from the Amazon marketing partner that sold it.
3,Does anyone know if K-Cups can be recycled?  I cannot seem to find out.  I would be much more likely to purchase a coffee machine that uses K-Cups if I knew the cups could be recycled.
3,I had many a k-cup but at 1.29 a piece. I'll just take my refill cup to the store and let someone else make me a cup. I have bought k cups on sale for as little as .54 a piece. Green mountain is one of the better coffees but lets be realistic with the price huh.
5,This is a great deal for this coffee.  It's my favorite and Amazon is a really good place to buy it.
5,"Green Mountain is our favorite coffee.  We switched from grinding our own to K cups recently.  We still love Vermont Country Blend and Heifer Hope, but this is the ultimate K-cup for us.  A medium roast, rich but not bitter.  It satisfies every time."
5,"This is one of my favorites.  Why is Amazon charging so much for it though?  Bought easily elsewhere for 10.00 or so.<br />Amazon, you can be competitive with this one.  That should be two boxes for this price."
5,"This is the best one I've tried from Keurig, not too strong, with a very creamy taste. You can't go wrong with this one."
5,This is simply the best non-flavored coffee in K-cups that I have tried.  I drink my coffee black and this has an excellent coffee aroma and taste.  It's not bitter nor acidic but has a full coffee flavor.
5,"The price for these K-Cups is great. They are so costly in the store, so this is a great way to buy in bulk."
4,"The coffee is a nice deep blend. The price, however; is high considering many retail stores are now carrying this brand for cheaper and no shipping. I will continue to buy this brand of coffee however I will no longer purchase it on line."
5,"So far, this is my favorite blend of coffee. It has a delicious flavor. Bold but not overpowering. I will definitely be buying this again!"
5,"I have tried many k-kup varieties and this is my favorite.  Mild, perfect for someone who likes a mellow coffee.  Add some Vanilla Coffeemate and it is HEAVEN.  A great start to my day.  I brew it into a disposable cup and my commute becomes 100% more enjoyable."
3,There ok have gone way up in price. Now that I have tried the Dunkin Donuts k-cups not sure if I will be going back to green mountain.
5,"This is our favorite coffee. Easy on the stomach, good tasting, not too light, not too strong, just right. Highly recommend."
5,It doesn't get any better than this in the a.m.  Brew .. sit back .. sip .. and ENJOY!
5,I love the variety of K-cups at Amazon. Green Mountain is awesome and the prices are fabulous. I use them at work daily.
3,Ordered this product without reading what i was getting ... dumb on my part.<br />My wife loves Nantucket Blend.  I mistakenly thought this was for 2 boxes of 24 k-cups because of the price.<br />Much cheaper to pick this great product up at Kohls or Bed Bath and Beyond if you have access to them.
5,"I have not found a bad ""Keurig"" coffee version yet.  This one included. Since receiving my machine I have been to Starbucks..maybe twice since the beginning of January.  I used to go 5X a week.  My husband is LOVING this gift, Starbucks is not.<br />Enjoy!!"
5,Great coffee at a good price. I'm a subscription buyer and I buy this month after month. What more can I say?
1,I received medium roast. Didn't receive the correct coffee shown on picture. Disappointed by this. I suppose ill try as its a lot of my trouble to return
5,The Keurig Green Mountain Nantucket Blend Coffee is great.  The flavor is pleasing and not too strong or too weak.  I like using the subscription plan.
5,Wonderful smooth taste.  I love this brand.  Great for my first cup in the morning or any other time of the day.  Great price.  Smooth taste.
5,Cant beat it for the price.  Will buy again.  Looked around for a while it couldnt find any good deals
5,"I love this Coffee!  I love that I can sign up with Amazon and get it delivered to my door and not have to search in the grocery stores for it, which half the time I can't find it.  Way to go Amazon, thank you!!!"
5,great coffe for the price. buying in big amounts makes it easy to feel safe that you will have coffee in the morning. no mess.
5,"This particular brand and blend of Green Mountain coffee is one of the best I have ever tasted or enjoyed.  Its got a nice body, is NOT bitter, and goes down very smoothly.  Would recommend to any coffee drinkers for their morning fix to get moving."
5,"I've had my Keurig B-40 brewer for almost 18 months.  I've probably tried over 30 different k-cup varieties.  One of my 5 favorites is the ""Green Mountain Nantucket Blend"". Not too strong and not too light.  Will wake you up but without a 'Jolt'."
5,I received the order in time. I love the flavor of this coffee and I can only make one cup of coffee at a time so I have a fresh cup of coffee all the time.
5,I love this coffee.  It is a very smooth and non bitter coffee.  The price was great.  It is very hard to find this particular coffee in this quantity.  It was also a good price!
4,"Have had this before, good smooth coffee made  quickly. Not the best (there are better) but its better than most.Ordered it here because its cheaper. Came very quickly and packed well."
5,Have tried lots of different favors and this is by far the best.  Not too strong and no nasty aftertaste like some leave.  This is now the only flavor I buy!
5,"Nantucket Blend is my very favorite K=cup.  This is a little surprising since I have always preferred really strong bold coffee, but the smooth flavor of Nantucket has really won me over.  I think I will order another box as soon I as finish this!"
5,I really like this coffee it has a smooth taste to it.  I also like the ability to buy in bulk so that I don't run out so often.
5,One of my favorite coffees by Green Mountain.  Huge savings by ordering through Amazon versus grocery stores or other sites.  Coffee does come loose in the box but I like to use my handy dandy lazy susan to hold them anyway. :)
5,"The Green Mountain coffee, Nantucket Blend K-Cup is a very smooth taste.  I don't like the bold coffees, so this one is right down my alley.  I would definitely purchase this one again."
1,"Was pleased with the packaging and prompt delivery however EVERY SINGLE PACKAGE WAS EMPTY.  No coffee inside.  No broken seals or holes, just nicely sealed empty k-cups.  Would like coffee with my coffee"
5,so I love the Kcup system. This coffee is one of the best of the Kcup coffees I have tried.  It is not too strong but has great flavor.
5,"My husband and I are in love with this coffee.<br />We both wanted something that is similar to folgers without having to use the my-k-cup everytime.<br /><br />This is mellow, not to light and has great flavor with milk and sugar (thats all we use)"
5,The Green Mountain Nantucket Blend K-Cup portion pack for Keurig is a great coffee and everything is fresh and packaged nicely.
5,Nantucket is my husband's favorite K-cup coffee. He has a Keurig coffeemaker at work and at home.<br />You can't beat the convenience and taste.
5,Have tried most all of the k - cup types of coffee and have decided that the nantucket blend is the best tasting cup of coffee available anywhere. Always a perfect taste and very good mouth appeal . LOVE THIS COFFEE !!!!
5,"Nantucket Blend by Green Mountain is the best coffee I ever tasted.  Some coffee is just too strong and bitter for my sensitive taste buds, this is just perfect!"
3,"A matter of taste, I prefer darker, richer roasts. This one is lighter on the coffee aroma and flavor and heavy on the acidity. A true ""medium"" coffee, I would say."
5,This is our favorite flavor of all of the Keurig choices. Just enough kick but still relatively mild.  Great price too!
5,I love the Green Mountain Nantucket coffee. It is every thing I hoped it would be.The taste and aroma is awesome. I certainly will purchase it again and again. Try it. You just might love it as I do. I get my coffee through Amazon and it is so easy and delivery is quick.  Pamela Hebert
5,"I've used this coffee before and after trying others, I seem to go back to it.  It's just a nice cup of morning coffee and the price for this produch was very good too."
5,"I absolutely LOVE the Nantucket Blend! Its not too bold, but yet not too weak either! The flavor is great and with a splash of creamer I'm out the door!"
5,This is delicious coffee.  I love K-cups and the price is right on Amazon.  This is a great cup of coffee anytime of the day.  I will purchase this again.
5,We enjoy Green Mountain Coffee Nantucket Blend K-Cups so much that I subscribe for a monthly delivery.  There are other coffees we like but Nantucket Blend is our favorite for our Breakfast Brew.  The price is reasonable for K-Cups too.
4,"This is excellent product, great for coffee lovers. The K-cups are very consistent and considering the price, much better than a trip to the coffee shop."
5,"This is my favorite coffee and the price is the cheapest I have seen anywhere. My husband and I drink a lot of coffee and we are very satisfied with the price and we are very pleased with Amazon, we order a lot from here. Very good service."
5,"A wonderful blend, very tasty, absolutely no bitterness like some french roasts I've had. The product was shipped on time and in perfect condition. I fully reccommend this coffee."
5,I have tried a wide verity of Green Mountain coffees and this one is the best. Smooth taste but yet not week tasting at all. No bitter or after taste. Just great coffee!
5,Delivery was fast and the best coffee for all the lovers of a great tasting coffee. Would recommend it to everyone excellent gift for a coffee drinker.
4,"This is one of the 1st kcups I have tried.  I have used kcups for many years.  Some are bland, some are too strong this just right.  Prices vary, but still is a good cup."
4,"This is a nice coffee...a go-to coffee I rely on.  It's not bitter, has a good aftertaste, and has a smooth body."
5,"Love this coffee - tastes great, and the aroma while brewing is simply wonderful...I would definitely purchase more. Good price too."
5,"Completely satisfied with this purchase. Product arrived in a timely manner and the product was as stated. A great product at a great price, will definitely buy again."
5,I would recommend this coffee to anyone who like a smooth medium roast. I find that the flavor is rich but not bitter...so satisfying!
4,"Best choice so far<br /><br />We have tried several options but this was our choice, based on taste and smell. Is hard to resist to stay away when brew this coffee in the morning.<br />Recommend this product."
5,This worked out great! I ordered 4 boxes! IT was a great deal and  on top of it I used my discover card cbb to pay for it so really it was free too me! LOVE IT best deal I could find anyways! hope you can enjoy it like I Do!
5,"I am a Cincinnati native living in Texas and I really missed Skyline Chili. This is a great substitute and very easy to make. I add tomatoes, onion and peppers to give more substance and leave out the chocolate. I've tried many of the Frontier soups and this is hands down my favorite."
4,This chili recipe was a great find.  My husband loved it and it was easy to make and alter as I liked.  I recommend it.
2,"Quality is OK but if you need maltodextring in larger but not huge quantities, buy Carbo Gain from NOW Foods. Much better bang for the buck."
5,If you like big wheat thins then this is a great buy. Who needs a Costco membership? They arrived in perfect condition and the crackers weren't broken up or anything.
5,having this come to my home makes it easier for me just wished that when there on sale in the store they would also lower the price to my home but they don't
2,Received product timely.  Upon opening product found weevil infestation. Put product in freezer to kill weevils.  Returning product would have been a nuisance.
3,"Generally the dog biscuits are great if not such a high percentage would be broken. The point in buying extra large biscuits is the ""extra large"", small pieces miss the reason for buying theme in the first place. There has to be a better way to pack the biscuits better than this."
5,This is as good as what I had in Peru - try mixing 1 tablespoon with 8 oz of an alfredo sauce - mix in shreaded chicken previously (2 breast)  cooked to your liking - let simmer on low for about 15 minutes - awesome
5,"Received aj&iacute; amarillo in a well-wrapped box.  Arrived promptly.  It tastes very good.  I used it to make ""Peruvian seviche.""  Great!"
5,The jars of aji amarillo were so well packaged with bubble wrap. ( I mean really well-packaged)The quality is great.
5,"This is the best paprika available; at least my husband thinks so.  He uses it on so many foods. I used to think it was only used for deviled eggs, but he has taught me differently. I liked the quick arrival and the packaging was good too.  Thank you.  I will use your site again."
5,"Terrific, need to buy more, barely got a bit for myself!  Good stuff if you like granola, but not for first time granola testers.  The crud at the store is packed with sugar and paraffin.  This is pure and wholesome."
3,"Having lived in Okinawa for a number of years, I am a big fan of Okinawa's ""raw"" brown sugar (not to be confused with the brown sugar we know here in America).<br /><br />This may be terrific sugar - however - it is NOT technically, organically, from Okinawa -- it is from Taiwan."
3,The product is fresh BUT I have bitten into a few nut shell fragments and this is unsatisfactory especially from a dental viewpoint.
4,Good flavor - Doctor tells me I am diabetic so trying Tulsi (holy basil) teas with hope of healing the pancreas.  One of many improvements - changes that may make a difference.<br />The tea is finer that I like but otherwise no negatives.
5,These are terrific tasting muffins and they have the greatest scent when they are baking.  The apples and cinnamon are tantalizing and for breakfast these are terrific
5,"Amazing punch of flavor in such a small wrapper! Love this stuff! Found it at a hotel we were staying at, went to the front desk where I found out the name of it. It's a bit pricey, but worth it! Very flavorful!"
3,Product is always excellent.<br />It is very hard to find Packaging in any smaller sizes.<br />still trying to find a Link for smaller and different quantities available.
5,I use this seedless jam as a topping for cheesecakes and as an ingredient in making bars. It is difficult to find a high quality seedless jam and I feel fortunate that this product is available.
1,"This product sells for $4.69 in New York City, the Bronx  and in<br />South Jersey (in Shoprite) for $4.69 a can.  Amazon is selling it for over five dollars a can, and you have to buy the case. Get it at the store. The formula is great just amazon has it over priced"
1,"SINCE I HAVE TWO BABIES ON THIS FORMULA, IT WAS A VERY CONVENIENT WAY TO ORDER IT. BUT OUT OF EVERY TWELVE PACK I ORDERED, AT LEAST TWO CANS WERE DENTED ENOUGH SO I DIDN'T DARE USE THEM.  IT IS TOO EXPENSIVE WHEN YOU WERE GETTING TEN FOR THE PRICE OF TWELVE."
5,"I love the taste of this sauce! It's not super spicy, but has a good kick to it. Love it as a shrimp marinade and sometime I mix it in my BBQ sauce for a little extra something. Really yummy stuff."
5,"My husband brought a bottle of this home from the restaurant in Cali. He made pork chops with it, we think this is the best marinade for meats, it also makes a great dipping sauce."
5,"I LOVE this pepper sauce!  I've been hooked on it for years; would recommend this to anyone who likes a little heat in their food, without the lasting burn.  I seriously put it on almost everything!"
5,"The Pepper Plant Chunky Garlic Hot Pepper Sauce 10 Oz. Has great flavor, as all the pepper plants do!  I just love it. It is a bit pricey, but worth it!"
5,"We love this stuff. It goes on everything, from eggs to tacos This is the second time we've purschased it."
5,"Taylor's Market is awesome.  Product is heavy garlic and uniquely unexplainable.  A little on the bitter side, but really enjoyable when dripped on things like Nachos to give it a different zing."
5,"My husband absolutely LOVES this sauce. We picked some up on our way through Gilroy, CA once and bought 6 on our next trip through! It adds great flavor to Tacos, Eggs, Potatoes, Breakfast Burrito's, and lots more!"
4,"I bought this years ago, after using it in a restaurant. It goes great on eggs and hash browns. It's my favorite breakfast sauce. I found other selections at [...]."
4,this can can add a little pick me up to your foods.would reccomend to anyone.
5,"<a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000PDRYPQ"">The Pepper Plant Chunky Garlic Hot Pepper Sauce</a><br />If you love garlic and hot pepper sauce, you will love this!!"
5,This is the best hot sauce around.  We use it in everything we make.
5,"The fruit chews by Jolly Rancher have become my favorite candy. Sometimes I can't wait to unwrap them, so I eat the rice paper wrapper. Love the variety of flavors!"
5,"This Prickly Pear Marmalade tastes very good! excellent! addictive! all the other prickly pear products (jelly, sirup, candies etc) are recommendable as well!"
5,This marmalade is so light and tasty on toast. Sellers are wonderful and pack beautifully. also recommend the prickly pear jelly as chicken glaze and prickly pear syrup - add a bit to homemade lemonade and enjoy!
1,Some of the best rice milk on the market. It's just too bad this is double the price you'll pay for it in the store.
5,TRUE LEMON IS AN ABSOLUTE MUST FOR MY WATER AND TEA.  I CAN'T DRINK THEM WITHOUT MY TRUE LEMON.  IT IS VERY REFRESHING PLUS I'M GETTING MY VITAMIN C.
5,"I use this product at home and love it to pieces. It's perfect for the office breakroom, especially in bulk, because it doesn't spoil like liquid juice. You can use it in cooking as well to add a jolt of flavor."
5,Love this product in my ice water!! Much more economical buying in bulk!! Great for the summer and for my diet!!
5,"I find True Lemon extremely convenient.  However, the packet indicates that it is 100% Natural and I would like to be assured that the additional ingredients are safe."
4,"These are great for taking with you to restaurants or for home use. Studies have shown that a lare number of bacteria have been found on lemon wedges at restaurants, so these packets are wonderful. I would like to see larger amounts of lemon in each packet and at a more reasonable price."
1,"Stale. The worst flavored, worst tasting walnuts that anyone ever tasted. They shouldn't even be on sale. Where is your quality assurance or quality control? I want my money back."
1,I should have read the ingredients list before purchasing this - they are not plain roasted walnuts or tasty roasted walnuts. I did not care for them at all. Strange combination of sugar and garlic coating.
5,My doctor told me I should eat more walnuts and although I have walnuts for baking they just don't quite cut it for munching.  I can also chop these to put into other things.  I tend to like the mixture of sweet and savory (these are more salty than flavored with anything) and are very good.
2,"The sugar salt combo season is so bad that I soaked them in water, washed out the canister and air dried them. Then and only then were they tasty."
5,"I love this product!!!  The seasoning takes my favorite nut and makes it even better!  And no MSG!!!  I can no longer find this item in the stores, so I am grateful amazon carrys them!"
5,I absolutely love these. I am actually shocked that there are a bunch of one-star reviews here--they're really nicely seasoned and crunchy and delicious. I want some right now!
5,This 6 pack deal is good deal compare to supermarket's prices.<br />The product itself tastes great so you have to be careful not to eat too much. :)
5,"I have eaten alot of different kinds of Walnuts but I have never found any better than Emerald's Dry Roasted Walnuts. I love them. I am a senior citizen and would recommend them to everyone, they are very good."
5,"I love this product, but it is not sold in stores in Arizona and I'm not sure why not."
5,What a delite to find these that do not have Soy added to the produts even their are traces of it when they are manufactured.Julanne Howard
5,"I first tried these at a store by where I live, LOVED them, but went back to find they had taken them out.  Found them here at Amazon, HAD to order more, they are a nice change from dry-roasted peanuts."
5,I am very happy with this purchase.  I love these Walnuts and cannot find them in the grocery store anymore.
5,This is my all time favorite nut to snack on. Incredibly delicious. Almost impossible to buy retail anywhere. Thank goodness for amazon.
5,"This is the best version of splenda because it does not contain any sugar, which the packets, the cartons, and the tablets do. This is really safe for diabetics, whereas the other forms are more than half sugar to bulk them up enough to package."
1,This candy when I opened the chocolate had white spots and looked like thick chalk. I later noticed that the box had a snow flake pattern like it was sold around xmas time. No good!
2,The candy arrived with some white waxy stuff on it; almost as if it had partially melted at one point.  Tasted chalky.  Not interested in a partial refund.  Next time find a way to make sure candy is not stale.
5,It is so convenient to have items sent directly to the house.  And this shippped very quickly and arrived in perfect condition.
5,I love the Turtles. They were not melted. Thank you for putting a cool pak in the box. Me and my husband enjoyed it very much and planning to buy from you all in the future.
3,"Did not come super fast, packaged was smashed but the turtles inside were not damaged. Box was decorated for Christmas which perhaps the 'ad' for them said that, but I didnt' realize that since they were a birthday gift. Maybe I missed the fine print! Tasted fine, were a hit!"
5,"I was introduced to Cavender's Greek Seasoning several years ago at a Greek Festival. It is so versatile. I use it to blacken steaks, grill Pork chops, season Gravy's, season Hamburgers,on potatoes. I give as gifts to friends I love it so much."
3,Not sure this was worth the effort.  Not the sellers fault - Just not worth the trouble.
5,I am very pleased with this product and the shipper.  The same procuct was ordered before and the transaction has always been great.
5,Once again if you love Hot & Spicy foods you have to give these a try! I have also tried the Tabasco Spicy Dill Pickles and you need to try them also. I personaly think that all these Tabasco items that I have reviewed are just what I like. Order some of these Tabasco items and see what you think.
5,"tabasco spicy pickeled okra are delicious. I could eat the whole jar<br /><br />at one sitting ( smile ). Really, really good. Wish they came in a<br /><br />larger jar.<br /><br />Problem / Shipping fees are too high for this product."
5,"I buy Ritter Sport Minis at my local (SE Wisconsin) Aldi food store. They come in a couple different assortments of milk chocolate varieties, and the minis are the perfect size for a bit of chocolate without going overboard! Best thing, at Aldi, they are only $2.49 a pack!"
5,"LOVE this product. The best one is the Peppermint & the Marzipan by far. They arrived neatly packaged. Not melted, thankfully. and oh so good!. I will be coming back for more"
5,I LOVE these chip.. I just started dieting and this satisfy every bit of my salty cravings. They are perfect and they taste AMAZING! I don't get the bad reviews but to each their own. I LOVE them!! &lt;3
4,"I love these crackers. Flavor is mild. Perfect with a good piece of cheese. Would have given it 5 stars but most packages I received had broken ones. Oh well, still taste great."
4,"The Teriyaki gives these healthy crackers a great flavor.  Baked not fried, low-cal.  They are so good it's really hard to eat just a few."
5,"Someone please tell me why this is not available as a ""Big Bowl"".  This is the best flavor that Nong Shim offers and has served as a quick lunch at work more times than I can count.  Fantastic flavor, just enough heat, but I could use more of it in the bowl.  Start a petition!"
5,"It's not super-spicy, but has just enough heat to set this noodle bowl apart from other noodle bowls. Easy to make, conveniently packaged and quite tasty!"
1,"Nong Shim's noodle that you need to boil to eat, it's good. But these ones, the noodle's texture is totally different . It's the same as those cheap ramen noodle. The seasoning is not good either. I will never buy this kind anymore."
5,"Came packaged accordingly, and very, very, very, very delicious!  This is a good product and it was packaged properly!  A+"
5,"This has me hooked.  I will no longer eat Ramen.  The flavor is robust and it just is an overall better noodle. I haven't mixed anything with it, but I am in heaven."
5,"Amazon shipped this item, it arrived in 3 days and it was awesome! Nong Shim Rules!<br />I highly recommend Nong Shim noodles!"
5,"I am gonna buy this again for the future for myself, when I ate this completely. Thank you so much for this product in Amazon.com."
4,"These noodles are worth the extra $ over the cheap ones. They taste less chemically and salty and have a firmer texture. Size of package is just right too. I prefer the spicy varieties. They add a little kick, but don't make you burn."
1,This is the microwave version of the original. I cannot stand it. The noodles have no flavor at all; and to me it is not spicy. I will not order any more of this product!
5,"Very high quality leaves, and a must for that perfumed lime touch in Thai cuisine. Shipment arrived in great condition, and I successfully froze much of it.  Now when recipes call for kaffir lime leaf, I just pull out several leaves and use them like fresh. Heavenly taste and aroma!"
5,I race homing pigeons and raw spanish peanuts are the best source of great protein and fat.  These peanuts are the best bulk quality I have ever seen!
5,It is a little on the sweet side but does not taste like a strong vodka.  I usually enjoy it as a dessert drink. It is still a good strong vodka but the sweet flavor kills the alcohol taste resulting in a very smooth drink.  I usually mix it with a little bit of ice water and it is perfect!
5,"All I can say about this is YUM YUM YUM! I use it in and on everything: hot chocolate, coffee, fruit, ice cream, soy milk..."
5,"There once was a fellow named Mick<br />Whose tackle had never been sick<br />Till he put it somewhere<br />Many others had dared<br />Now Mick has a fine spotted... pudding.<br /><br />Hey, we do what we must to satisfy the censors!<br /><br />Theo."
5,"This paired with the Devon Custard is really pretty yummy - and it's also a fun conversational item. It's easy to make by boiling the can in water and it's not as sticky, super sweet as the Treacle. Shipping was quick."
5,"I love to keep some of this in my cupboard because first of all, my family loves it and secondly, it gets a giggle each time I show anyone. I grew up with this dessert in the UK and thought nothing of the name till I moved to the USA....makes me giggle now too....ha ha"
5,"What is more thoughtful or caring than the gift of spotted dick? C'mon, even a sour puss can't keep a straight face when a case of this stuff shows up at their door! (For the record as far as tinned spotted dick goes, Hienz is by far the best!)"
5,"Haven't even tried the product yet, but bought a case for gag gifts.  Have sent three out so far for b-day gag gifts and have had lots of laughs.  Will actually have to taste some one of these days."
5,"If your looking for some spotted dick, this is the best you will ever find."
3,"No idea what this tastes like, it's just a running gag with my family - someone gets one every year in their stocking for Christmas :).<br />It kinda scares me."
5,This hits the 'spot' especially when you are alone and now in a 6 pack no less.
2,"Look at some of the main ingredients: Partially Hydrogenated Canola and Palm Oils.  This stuff may taste sweetly good, but the hydrogenated oils wreak havoc on your body.  You'd be a terrible hostess poisoning guests with this stuff. Well, unless you have very bad guests :P"
4,Are they kidding? Who would name a product this? Really!!! Love the part about preventing it from spurting...LOL!
1,It didn't remove the spots... Now what am I going to do with all of the sponges I bought?
5,"I've always wanted to experience a mouthful of dick, and now, just like Obama, yes I can! And it even comes in black flavor! Just look for the extra long can!!"
1,I ordered the spotted dick. After eating I felt a little strange. I went to the bathroom and to my horror realized that I had this horrible disease. Luckily 1 gallon 128 Floz Tuscan Whole Milk cleared this up for me.
5,"I was looking for a varied mix without the candy/chocolate because it would melt at camp. This stuff is awesome. It satisfies my cravings for salt and sugar, for chewy and crunchy. I eat it for lunch with a banana or a snack after dinner. Helps me feel healthy. Gives me sustained energy."
5,I love cornbread. This is cheap & very good. It is sweet & delicious. It is also very easy to prepare. I enjoy it with real butter or a little honey. Great stuff! Can't beat it for price! I usually buy this at the store though.
5,This is my favorite coffee and I was so happy to find it on Amazon.  It is not available in my area.
2,"I bought this because the store was out of my brand.  I was disappointed with this coffee.  Not very flavorful, and the flavor is just ok.  Wouldn't buy again."
3,"I purchased this plant as a gift for my husbands office; it looked more like the 'Charlie Brown Christmas Tree' than a bonsai tree.  Although I have to admit, it is alive and healthy."
1,This is the most pitiful excuse for a bonsai that I have ever seen in my life. It consists of a twig in a cheap plastic pot. Nothing at all like the photo. I would never do business with this company again. Amazon should be ashamed for dealing with this company!
3,Not my favorite - not because it's not very good but because it's not very good for very long.  An excellent chew if you just want or need a stick of gum for 5-10 minutes to clean your teeth after a meal.  Otherwise I'd recommend something else.
5,"5 bucks at your local Costco.<br /><br />Snappy and clean texture, not mushy like quakers - very easy to eat. Microwavable. Prepares very fast.<br /><br />I highly recommend this product. I do not recommend that 17 dollar price Amazon has up - that's insane."
5,We love steel cut oats but hate the time it takes to cook. Coach's Oats are every bit as good but take a fraction of the time to cook.
5,"I buy my Coach's Oats at Costco when they have it.  I love it...it cooks quick and fills you up.  The best part is that it's really healthy and is a whole grain.  The bag will last you a long time and it stays fresh.  If you haven't tried this product, I highly recommend you do!"
5,I love this oatmeal!  It's great tasting and easy to make.  I have a bowl every morning and it is wonderful.
5,i love this stuff! im 15 yrs old and i like to eat organic/healthy/non-processed foods and this stuff definitely gets the job done. its a very healthy way to start off the morning and its only cost 14 bucks!
5,"I'm so excited I decided to buy this here, the bag is huge the price is great and I love Coach's Oats!"
5,My wife loves this oatmeal and she can't always find it. I get it here for a good price. I hope they will keep carrying it.
5,"I like steel-cut oats.  I've tried different brands, but Coach's is my favorite.  They are not instant, so to save time, I make 3-4 servings at a time.  They reheat well."
5,"Wonderful!  A great buy for the money - easy to cook and healthy with a rich, nutty flavor!! I would recommend these to everyone."
5,"This tastes kinda like Jamba Juices Steel Cut Oatmeal. Great and easy to make. Microwavable too. Cooking stove top isn't THAT much better than microwaving it so I just microwave it. It is only $6.39 at Costco though, so I would just buy it there."
5,"That's the one and only ingredient in this oatmeal.  No sugar. No salt. nNo preservatives or ""natural flavors"".  No food dyes - none of that.  Just whole grain goodness.  Cooks up in just a few minutes. I love this oatmeal!"
5,"This is the best oatmeal breakfast item on the market.  Having tried every oatmeal out there, I find that this mixture is the best.  Costco used to carry it, but can't find it there anymore."
5,"this has become my absolute favorite morning breakfast.  The texture and flavor are perfect.  It's great with Smart Balance, maple syrup, blue Agavy syrup, fruit, and even grated cheese. It's nice to know that something so healthy can taste so delicious.<br />Sandra Bennett, Atlanta, GA"
5,Bought this in the Maui Costco and thought it tasted so great we dragged home the unfinished huge bag of oatmeal.  Went to our local Costco and they did not sell it but another type of cut oatmeal which is not nearly as good and a different texture.  This is a fine tasting healthy oatmeal.
5,This is the best oatmeal I have ever had. It is tasty and has a wonderful texture. I cannot recommend this product highly enough.
1,Tossed this out after trying it.  Texture and taste were far below expectations.  Seemed kind of mushy and pasty.  Pricy to boot.
5,I actually gave these to a local baker for my daughters cupcakes. They looked great. Showed up perfectly on white and chocolate icing. In great shape.
3,$30 for a 12 pack?<br /><br />Are you serious?<br /><br />Trader Joe's sells 4 packs for $3.<br /><br />And that's about all they are worth.
5,Treat yourself and your loved ones to a vintage treat!<br />You won't regret it.
1,"I was not happy about the price of this single package item!!!  What a rip-off!!!  If you can, buy it from the store...I was charged over $12 for a package that costs only $1.99-$2.50 in stores...the problem is finding a store that carries this item"
5,Arrived well packaged and just as described.  Also expiration date was not for another 6 months.  Can't beat the price either a lot cheaper than the grocery store.
5,"I like the jars because they are a little cheaper then the plastic gerber containers, but they don't reseal as easy. If you keep the open food in the fridge for the recomended time there is no problem."
4,amazon sent a replacement after my original arrived broken down and covered with ants!<br />The second one was overnighted broken too- but the outer box was undamaged. Of course amazon<br />customer service is amazing- and refunded my money. will try to stick to plastic..
5,"""VERY CONVENIENT"". It doesn't get any better than this. Arrives promptly at your door, extremely well packaged and with a generous expiration date."
5,"I like the jars because they are a little cheaper then the plastic gerber containers, but they don't reseal as easy. If you keep the open food in the fridge for the recomended time there is no problem."
5,"I like the jars because they are a little cheaper then the plastic gerber containers, but they don't reseal as easy.  If you keep the open food in the fridge for the recomended time there is no problem."
5,"Ok, sounds crazy i know but i heard about this baby food diet and figured whats there to loose. The food tastes good, and im sure your baby will like it too hahaha!"
2,"This just did not smell or taste like real olive oil.  And the smoke point was lower than it should have been.  Perhaps it was a bad batch, diluted with some other oil, but I'll never use it again."
1,"Totally not worth paying for. Even my kids hated this stuff. Very cheap cocoa in tiny tiny tins for too much money. I could have gone out and bought twice as much Swiss Miss, and enjoyed that a whole lot more."
5,"This is the same tea they serve at PF Chang's.<br />If you like tea, you must try this, 5 star tea, excellent!"
5,"This is my favorite tea to brew for breakfast.  The orange peel, peppermint leaf and other flavors mixed<br />with the tea infuse it with a delightful, tropical flavor.  The nylon infuser tea bag is the best.<br />I purchased six boxes for a great price from Amazon."
4,I love the flavor of this tea. I wish it didn't come in nylon bags as I just can't make myself use and throw away all that plastic. I hope that they will come out with these flavors in a more ecologically responsible package.
5,I've been ordering this tea directly from the company and really like the flavor. I was surprised to find it on Amazon and at a lower cost...good value for great tea.
5,"i first tried this tea in a hotel room in san diego and never forgot it.  checked it online and was happy to find amazon had much better prices than if bought from the company.  it doesn't come in the cute, individually wrapped boxes but it's still the same great tasting green tea."
5,We came across this tea at PF Chang's China Bistro a few years back.  This flavor has became our favorite blend of tea.  It does well as hot or iced tea.
5,"Really good ""Organic tea"".... im not a tea person(well hot tea anyway) but this tea comes in a lot of new and interesting flavors that changed my attitude on hot tea. still love coffee though"
5,If you enjoy a cup (or two) of awesome tea...look no further!<br />I love this!<br />I drink it all the time!<br />The flavor is amazing!<br />I highly recommend it...<br />it makes a great gift too.
5,We enjoy hot tea and we find Revolution tea to be of the best quality.<br />The tea bag itself is of the highest quality and there is never a single<br />tea leave in our tea.
5,"I had never been to a PF Changs before, I found that the food is great but the tea is amzing. I had to ask the manager who their supplier was. My wife and I are now in love with this tea."
5,This is about the 4th re-order of Breakfast blend K-cups from Amazon.  I think that itself is the best review I can think of.  See me at the 10th reorder.
3,"Not bad, Not great, but good coffee. Put it on my list so if I can not get my first choice, I have a backup."
5,"Every morning this is my second cup. It's smooth, has a really nice ""coffee"" taste and leaves me feeling satisfied for that coffee urge. I can drink this cold it's that good! Too bad the prices keep going up!"
5,Tasty product offering a great cup of coffee to get the day started.  I really like the reduced prices with the subscription service that provides the product automatically before we run out.
5,"Just regular breakfast coffee...a great way to start the day! I want coffee not flavors or extra caffeine.  This is my ""goto"" coffee to fully awake."
5,I think this is a great mild blend and the price is reasonable for a k-cup. I drink it every morning.
5,These are fine fine K cups. I like the BIG box. Less trips to the store. Coffee is divine with breakfast or any time!
5,We love our Keuring brewer and we love this coffee. The value for the 50 count pack is right on.
5,I think that buying the coffee this way is the best way to get the most bang for your buck. The coffee tastes great.
4,My husband tried this coffee while we we visiting relatives and just kept raving about it because it did not have any of the bitterness associated with coffee. We were able to pick up the Keurig coffee maker for a great price and order this quantity from Amazon.
3,This is a very mild coffee.  I like the Green Mountain Coffee brand but if you are a coffee connosieur this is not for you.
5,"Green Mountain K-cups are consistently a great value. Breakfast Blend isn't too strong or too weak, just right for my whole family."
5,One of my favorites.....hopefully this continues at a reasonable price. Each k-cup brews perfectly. Well pleased.Will continue to order as long as it is a suscribe and save item.
5,This  is the best coffee to wake up to in the morning!  Is not bitter just right.  Enjoyed by all who it is served to.
5,"A smooth light roast for your morning coffee break. This is my favorite blend, not too strong with excellent flavor. Highly recommended for Keurig Coffee machines."
3,"The product was not in original packages, only individual Kcups loose in a box. Also, this was shown to ship as PRIME but took a week."
4,this is the least strong and bitter coffee I can find in k cups. I do not like strong coffee and this is the only one I can enjoy out of all that came in the variety pack that came with the coffee maker.
5,Love the Green Mountain Coffee; tastes great in the Keurig and this is the best price yet!  Would definitely continue to buy!  I usually go through about a box per month and found this to be the most economical purchase!
5,Very good price and excellent coffee.. Packed perfect it is less than 60 cents per cup. I will always order my k-kups from amazon
4,"Keurig is amazing and Green Mountain coffee is just as amazing.<br />This is coffee that will open your eyes in the morning, as well<br />as provide a welcome break during the day.<br />Its not bitter, its smoooooooooooth and mellow.<br />No aftertaste.  Love it!!!!!!!!!!"
5,The Green Mountain Breakfast Blend coffee is really my favorite K-cup coffee. Not to bold and not wimpy either. Will order again and again.
5,Always a crowd pleaser!<br />I love this stuff!<br />Great deal from amazon!<br />They are always atleast 4 months before they expire
5,Green Mountain Coffee Breakfast Blend is good product at a good price!<br />I am very satisfied with the level of service provided.
5,"In my humble opinion, this is by far the best tasting k-cup flavored drink. I tried it all. It has a distinct coffee flavor that is not too strong but not too light."
4,This seems to be the best tasting coffee in the small pods that I have ever tasted.  The blend is perfect for early morning with breakfast.  The strength is just right and have a very good taste when I mix it with my cream and sweetener. Doesn't over dominate and just taste great.
5,"I have been having difficulty finding this blend at local stores. After trying many different flavors over the past 18 months, I find this the most enjoyable blend yet, followed closely by Kona blend. Thanks to Amazon for carrying this blend at an affordable price."
5,This coffee is great and I have tried many types. I can brew 2 cups out of one k cup as well
5,"i love, love, love the coffee. not too strong, but perfect for a cup of joe. very affordable brand and worth every penny."
2,"The flavor is not that great.  I would prefer something with a little more flavor,tastes like cheap coffee.  I would not this purchase again."
5,This breakfast blend is just the right strength for my morning cup of coffee.  I drink it black and it is wonderful. I also ordered this in the decaf and it's just as good...can't tell the difference in the decaf and regular roast.
3,Smooth taste. Most certainly for lighter coffee drinkers. I prefer a stronger cup of coffee. But would order again to keep a variety around for guests.
5,Love the taste of this coffee. Great flavor- It's not too strong like some other products for Keurig!<br />i certainly would recommend this product. Shipping was great. Fast!
5,"love this coffee, its a bit light but but very good taste. Works amazing with the kurig machine, easy to use, clean, and fast. I only use kurig machine now and love all the different coffee options.."
5,"I don't like really strong coffee, so after trying over a dozen different K-cups this is now my #1 choice and maybe the only K-cup I will buy anymore."
5,We first tried Green Mountain Breakfast Blend coffee when we purchased our Koerig coffee maker.  The flavor fit us both perfectly.  Now that's all we drink.
5,"This stuff's great, especially, as suggested by its name, first thing in the morning. It's not too dark, but it's not so mild that you don't feel like you've had a cup of coffee.<br />We think it tastes even better made with bottled water.<br />Order with confidence."
5,We normally buy Folgers or Maxwell House coffee but we have found Green Mountain comes the closest in k-cup form and we waste much less coffee now.
5,"The price was awesome, the shipping was incredibly fast.  I like this coffee better that most of the K-cup brands.  Just wish they able to be recycled.  But I would buy again from this company."
5,"Great medium coffee.  Nothing too fancy.  This is my goto coffee every morning.  The closest I have gotten to Dunkin Donuts coffee, without paying their ridiculous prices for their branded K-Cups."
5,these green mountain k cups are great tasting with my favorite breakfast blend and its very conveninet and the best k cups for me that we like will buy again
5,"This coffee is the perfect coffee for me.  Not too strong, but just right.  My guests always compliment me on this great coffee."
2,We have ordered this coffee on several occasions and have been happy with the it.  The most recent order seemed lacking in quality.  It was bitter and disappointing.
5,"A very mild, but pleasant blend. Not as strong as I normally prefer, but the taste is so good I drink it anyhow. It's perfect if you like to drink coffee late in the day but don't want the stomach side effects that often comes with it.<br /><br />Definitely in my top 3 of all K-Cup blends."
5,"This is the best coffee for me.  I've tried others, but so far, I haven't found anything bettter. It's not just for breakfaast anymore."
5,"I wasn""t sure if I would even like the Keurig coffee maker because I don't like strong coffee,this is wonderful for all of us who like the mild brews,plus these little k-cups are so convienient,I recommend this product."
2,"Really weak by my standards, I have to use the smallest volume on the Keurig to get decent flavor. Get extra bold cups instead if you don't like watery coffee."
5,"I can drink various flavored cremes, but there is only one coffee that I love and it's Breakfast Blend. Iv'e tried soooooooo many, I""m a BB girl!"
5,"Great breakfast blend.  I'm not a coffee lover by any means, but my wife and I both agree that this is a pretty good mild breakfast coffee."
5,PERFECT for breakfast or anytime of day!! Have shared with others and they agree -mild and smooth flavor -no strong coffee taste -flavor is just right!!
5,"These are k-cups, great price and great flavor came really fast it was a good product. These are the best deal online for k-cups"
5,This is my husbands favorite coffee and it is the best of all the breakfast blends.  Green Mountain really make some great well balanced coffees.  This one is perefct for those who do not like an over powering cup of coffee.
5,This is an excellent coffee. It has a full flavor but not overpowering.  The Keurig K-cup system is great for single cup use or where one likes to drink various coffees.  Amazon's prices are  very competetive and the shipping is fast.
4,"As always, the coffee was excellent.  Just wish the price would go down on these, although this purchase I thought was reasonable."
5,Love this coffee. Have ordered it before and will continue to order it. Enjoy it day and at night. Thanks.
5,"This coffee is not too strong, not too weak.  This is the best I have made through my Keurig so far and I will continue to order this brand and blend!"
5,This is my favorite coffee for my Keurig coffeemaker. It is so convenient to get it through Amazon and cheaper than running around to the stores trying to find the lowest price.
5,"Nice to have coffee delivered right to your doorstep.  I had gotten the variety pack, so I could see which coffee I liked the best and this was the coffee for me."
5,"It's a smooth blend - none of the extreme (to me, anyway) bitterness in many coffees.  Wakes me up quickly in the morning and relaxes me in the evening.  I've tried a lot of coffees for my Keuring, but this is my favorite."
5,I think this is the best coffee because it is not to strong and is so good sometimes I drink 6 or 7 cups a day.
5,Green mountain coffee is just delicious..and the prices at amazon cannot be beat! The offer to get more than one box at a discounted rate makes it that much more convenient!
5,"I like this brand of coffee very much.  Reasonably priced here, as compared with my grocery store.  A good deal."
5,I love the smoothness and taste of Breakfast Blend by Green Mountain...My only negative review is that it is never on a special price value as are other blends...As long as I can afford it I will buy it.
5,"Delicious cup of coffee. This is not the best coffee I have tasted but it is very enjoyable and I have not found one That I do not enjoy. Quick, easy and enjoyable."
5,Received product in a timely manner.  Quality of product was good.  Product performed well in the purpose that it was ordered for. Thanks
5,This coffee suits my taste just right. I do not like a heavy or acidic tasting coffee but this one is mild with plenty of favor and I can drink it anytime of the day.
5,I ALWAYS BUY MY COFFEE FROM AMAZON AS THE PRICES ARE CHEAPER AND I LOVE ALL THE COFFEE. BEST PRICE ON LINE.
5,"Love a great cup of Green Mountain Coffee in the morning, to get my day off to a great start.<br />Will order again...."
5,"This is my favorite breakfast coffee. Very smooth, no bitterness at all. I would rather have a cup of this than a to strong cup of starbucks."
5,"Item was received as promised. The coffee was very good, the only thing that I would like is a K-cud that would give a 16oz cup."
5,I've tried many of the K-Cups for the Keurig coffee machine and I still find Green Mountain breakfast blend to be the best! : )
4,The coffee is great but it's now cheaper at Bed Bath and Beyond with their 20% coupon and taxes added.
5,This is by far my favorite coffee. I have been trying to give other blends a chance but keep coming back to this one. It isn't too dark or too light.. It's perfect. Will continue purchasing this one!
5,Coffee is very good and as far as k-cups go it is a very good price.I order them all the time from amazon
5,"A perfectly blended cup of smooth, rich coffee at a fantastic price.  We've found Green Mountain flavors are always as advertised and recommend to anyone with a single cup brewer."
4,"I like this coffee from Green Mountain,some are to strong for my taste and others the K cups dont seem to work right,but these never seem to have a problem and the taste is good"
5,This is a great product.  I love the Keurig and Green Mountain Breakfast Blend is just right for me.
4,Many of the brands I've tried are too bold. I tried several brands and types and this is the one for me.  I am very pleased with it and will continue to order it.
5,"Have tried many varieties of K cups and green mountain is the best. My favorite blend is breakfast blend. Mild coffee, if you like Dunkin Donuts, you will like this.  If you are a starbucks drinker, try a bolder blend."
5,"I'm glad to taste this one; it's ideal for me, not bitter. Taste is smooth, whether adding sugar/cream or black.  I'll order more."
4,This is a good mild coffee for the drinker that doesn't like a strong bold blend in the morning.  I don't like a burnt tasting coffee and this is the one I like the best.
5,I buy K-cups all the time and it was nice to buy a double pack for less money than I would have paid in the store. The breakfast blend is not a bold coffee. Being rather mellow and not bitter and with no after taste. If you are looking for a mild tasting coffee this would be a good choice.
4,"If you're more of a Dunkin Donuts or Diner-style coffee person, this is great coffee."
5,"Good cup of coffee. If you are looking for a nice cup to wake up to, this is it. Light blend, no overpowering taste. I prefer bolder blends but my husband likes light - so this was our compromise blend, and I enjoy it as much as he does."
5,"My preference is Green Mountain Breakfast Blend.  It is never bitter or too strong.  I like coffee, but those strong ones just don't make it with me.  Give me the mild ones any day."
5,My favorite blend of coffee for my Keurig. I've tried about 15 different flavors but this is by far my favorite.  Very smooth and not overpowering or bitter.  Was buying at Walmart but they stopped stocking it.  Found it at Amazon for the same price.
5,Green Mountain Breakfast blend coffee is a mild roast that goes down easy in the morning.  My wife actually runs a cup through the Keurig twice.  Buying it this way breaks down to 50 cents per K-cup versus a dollar at any store.
5,"Love this coffee, it has just the right amount of flavor, is not to strong or to light. I have several cups through the day and enjoy everyone of them."
5,"Green Mountain Breakfast Blend coffee is the best!  I love the smooth, but robust taste!  I can hardly wait to smell and taste my coffee every morning!"
5,This is my every day coffee. It's a smooth coffee with no bitter after taste. This is not the coffee for those who like a strong cup of coffee. This coffee is for those who don't like to drink coffee that has been sitting  on a burner for hours but like the first cup of fresh coffee
5,"i've been using these k-cups for months now.  the breakfast blend is perfect for people who don't like a very strong bitter coffee in the morning.  the coffee from the breakfast blend is wonderful... not too strong, not overwhelming, but delicious."
5,I give this 5 stars. This is my favorite of all the K cups I've tried. Trust me I have tried a lot. If you like a mild coffee you will love this one.
5,Great coffee. Arrives when you folks say it is to be delivered.  Will continue to purchase 2 pack from Amazon when it is on sale. Very easy to place an order.
5,"Good Product.  For heavy coffee drinker it is a little expensive but well worth the price if you only dring 1 or 2 cups a day, Service from vendor was splendid."
4,This product makes a good cup of coffee at a reasonable price for the Keurig coffee maker and I would recommend it.
5,"This is my favorite K-cup and one my husband and I can agree on (I prefer darker roast, he likes a lighter roast coffee).  It holds up well to the cream and Splenda I add.<br /><br />However, this price is outrageous.  Far more than I pay at the grocery store."
5,I have tried about a dozen different flavors of the k-cups and this one is just right. The perfect blend.
5,"I just love the breakfast blend.  I hate bitter, strong coffee and rarely made coffee b/c it was awful.  I became a DD lover and now I have the K-cups to drink at home."
5,I love my Breakfast Blend coffee from Green Mountain. It light without a bitter aftertaste. It is a good everyday morning cofffee for me I would  recommend this to anyone who likes a light not bitter cooffe if you like a really strong cup of joe in the morning this isn't you coffee
5,This has a really nice flavor.  Would not hesitate to buy it again but probably not from Amazon or its vendors as they are overpriced.
5,I like this blend but the price is ridiculous. Found them at winn Dixie (and other flavors) $7.99 for a pack of 12.
5,"After pricing out different places to purchase this coffee as a gift, we realized that Amazon was able to provide us with so many K-Cup options but we love Green Mountain it has great flavor for a morning or evening cup. Enjoy!! You will Not be disappointed in this purchase!!"
5,"Green Mountain Breakfast Blend is an excellent light roast coffee served in a K-Cup.  Smooth, silky,it has a gentle flavor yet enough of a robust coffee flavor to allow a very pleasurable experience.  Highly recommended."
5,This is my favorite keurig coffee. I prefer it over any starbucks or dunkin or any other coffee. Nice and smooth taste without a usual bitter aftertaste. I's the perfect cup of coffee.
5,"This is the best k-cup coffee I've had.  Its bold smooth flavor is great for bkfst, but just as good to enjoy w/desserts or an afternoon pick-me-up.  I love it!"
5,"K-Cups are great if you only drink one cup a day otherwise it could get expensive.  This flavor is good for the basic coffee drinker, no funky flavors added, just basic coffee."
4,Green Mountain is one of my favorite coffee brands.  Breakfast blend is mellow and a great way to start your day.
1,"The coffee is good but the price is ridiculous($1.25 each K-cup approx).  You can get it from Green Mountain for 75 cents a K-cup (delivered) which is still too much. Buy it for 60 cents a K-cup at Bed, Bath and Beyond or Kohls."
1,"Do not buy this blend if you prefer dark and bold coffee and/or if you like coffee that can hold cream.  It is weak in flavor and best described as tea flavored coffee.  It is, however, not bitter and fairly smooth."
5,Received this item in a timely manner.  Was what I expected. Gave as a Christmas gift.  Would purchase again.
5,We were very pleased with this product and the short time in which we received it.
5,"The K cups were loose and not bound in plastic wrap or cardboard box.  I was very happy to see that.  The K cups were not damaged in any way and is at least a little better for the environment given the use of them, by me, is not good for my carbon foot print. So every little bit helps."
2,"For anyone liking a weaker coffee,this brand would be fine, but I prefer a stronger coffee so I wouldn't choose this brand again for that reason."
4,"Personally I find this blend to be rather bland.  However, my wife really likes it, so I'll rate it 4 stars."
5,This is the best way to buy GMC.  Wish I could get it all at this price and have home delivery.
1,Deceptive ad.  You can buy from Green Mountain for $13.95 a box of 24.  Don't buy from these crooks.
1,13 dollars for 24 cups free shipping over 50 dollars is the going rate. These folks are pulling a swiftie
5,Love the coffee.<br /><br />Don't like the fact that I can buy this cheaper from Amazon than I can right here in Vermont!
1,"I have ordered Breakfast Blend over the last three years.  The last order I received through Amazon was just awful! Bitter, burnt, undrinkable.....what are they doing to my once favorite coffee??"
1,"Since I've had my Keurig K-cup coffee brewer I have never had such horrible coffee!  Tastes like cardboard!  I usually get either donut shop k cups or Paul Neuman's Own.  Also Midnight Express, ALL good.  But this Morning Blend junk isn't ANY good at all.  Never again!"
1,"For the price you pay, the pods should make a good cup of coffee. This coffee was watery and bland.  Don't buy. I think Tulley's is the best."
1,"I have ordered Breakfast Blend over the last three years.  The last order I received through Amazon was just awful! Bitter, burnt, undrinkable.....what are they doing to my once favorite coffee??"
5,"This is my favorite coffee out of the 18+ Kuerig cups that I've tried. It's smooth, and not too heavy or bitter.<br />I think this product is priced above it's value, but it's as good as Starbucks for abut 1/3 the cost."
1,"I ordered this coffee and another brand, it seems, about three weeks ago.  I checked this morning, February 8,  and found the deliver is out into March or Apri.  I  paid for the product soon after it was ordered and have been told on checking delivery that it can no longer be canceled.  Wow!!!!!"
5,THIS HAS BEEN MY FAVORITE COFFEE SINCE DAY ONE OF HAVING MY KEURIG. YOU CAN'T MESS IT UP. EVERY CUP IS PERFECT.
5,I love the Breakfast Blend because it is not real strong and does not have a bitter taste.  Another great blend is the Nantucket Blend.
5,"My husband and I both really enjoy the taste of this coffee.  I tend to like a full robust flavor, and my husband likes his coffee on the milder side, but this coffee satisfies us both.  It is 'just right'!"
5,This coffee is perfect for the morning. Not to strong but it gives you the perfect smooth jolt that we all crave in the AM..highly recommended.
5,"Excellent coffee for someone who wants a medium roast, mild tasting cup of coffee.  I do not like the dark roast, strong, bitter coffees.  This one is perfect."
4,"The only reason I did not give it five stars is the small package (24).  I like to buy in bulk of 108 cups or more in a single box.  Much better price.  Disallowing the smaller package, I must say that the coffee will not disappoint anyone."
5,"We have tried many different types of K-cup coffee flavors and this is the one we keep coming back to.  Neither one of us cares for bitter, strong tasting coffee.  This has a mild, pleasant taste and it never varies from that. Definitely recommend!"
5,The Green Mountain Breakfast Blend coffee is wonderful.  I don't like strong bitter coffee and this is just great for my coffee type.
5,Love this coffee. I received it within 2 days and was very happy with<br />everything.I would recommend this brand and also Donut People coffee.
3,I purchased this coffee for my teenage daughter in college.  She said it tasted OK but was weak compared to Starbucks.  She prefers a stronger coffee. It is really hard to tell the strenght of the coffe by the description.
5,"I love this brand of k-cup! Just the right blend for me... not too strong, not too light... just right. Amazon gives you the best value when buying k-cups :)"
5,"Excellent taste, smooth, easy going.  I like a mild drink to start my day and this is it.  Heartily endorse this coffee."
5,I have tried other mild brews but this is the best by far it meets all of my requirements for this type of coffee.
2,"Very dissapionted in this oder.Have had this coffee before from another source,but it wasn't avaliable at the time so I odered it thru ammazon.Not the same coffee.Very stale and weak.My hhusband and I both noticed it.Wish I had not order the 50 count but something smaller"
5,"I use all sorts of K-Cups, but this breakfast blend is definately my Go-To blend!! It is perfect - not too light, not too dark. I highly recommend this, as the price for the 50-count box is pretty good!!"
5,Always brews great in my tall cup. Many other coffees tend to be too weak when you use the larger cup settings but not this one... Like I said... Yum!!
5,The K-cups are great. This blend was just right. Have to have at least 1 cup  a day. Enjoyed it. The taste was just right. Will definetly buy again.
5,Good to purchase in a larger quantity! Ease for keeping supplies in stock! Easy to obtain from Amazon without a third party involved.  Got to use my free shipping - yea.
5,Very pleased with this product. This is not the first time I have purchased Green Mountain Coffee and it wont be the last.
2,"I switched to Green Mountain Breakfast Blend after not being able to get Black Tiger as a super saver item.  It was a real disappointment.  Very weak and certainly not something I would want as ""breakfast blend"".."
3,"I like the taste, but the light roast was too light for me.  I find myself brewing smaller cups of coffee, hoping for a stronger taste.  Next time, I'll go for a medium or dark roast.  I think it was the medium that I had before and I really liked it."
5,"My wife has drunk this coffee for several years.  She tried many different brands before settling on this k-cup. It is a mild great tasting brew that you will like if you like a typical donut shop coffee. Not a Starbucks brew, but a regular mild brew. Give it a try."
5,I love this product. No more measuring coffee in the morning.<br />No more throwing old coffee out. Best Ideal ever.
5,I searched Google and found these k-cups. The price is reasonable.  Exceptionally fast delivery. I am very pleased and will order again.
5,Green Mountain Breakfast Blend is the best moderate blend for the Keurig Brewer.  Very good taste and not acidic.
3,"Tried this blend as a change from routine, but did not find it as enjoyable as I had hoped, still, it was good, just not great.<br />Pat"
5,"<a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B003JA5KKS"">Green Mountain Coffee Keurig Breakfast Blend, 24-Count K-Cups (Pack of 2)</a><br /><br />WE LOVE THE BREAKFAST BLEND- WE'VE TRIED MOST OF THEM,<br />THIS ONE IS IT FOR US."
3,"Not too strong,not too weak.This is the coffee I buy my wife for her mornings.It is probably the simplest k cup brew,but sometimes that is all you might want."
1,These K-cups are either extremely old or they're not authentic Green Mountain K-cups. The coffee is weak and has a bad after-taste. Both my spouse and I have noticed this independently of each other.<br /><br />I tried to contact the seller to ask about this but couldn't figure out who it was.
5,"This is very good coffee. I don't like strong coffee, this is nice and mild, a great breakfast blend. I use cream in it and it is just great. Will buy again."
5,Great coffee and so easy to brew.  This coffee has great aroma and is good to the last drop.  I actually like all the brands.  This is the way coffee should taste!!
5,"I'm never disappointed with the Breakfast Blend Coffee from Green Mountain Coffee.  It's always fresh and makes a very smooth cup of coffee, never bitter."
4,I use this as my morning coffee wake up call.  I continue to re-order it because I like the medium roast flavor.
5,"The coffee fenominal, the price fantastic and the delivery was right on point!!!!! I recommended this offer to my friends n family and they jumped right in, I got my delivery first!!!"
2,Not strong enough for the first cup in the morning.  I need something strong to wake me up. Maybe I should have found a stronger blend
5,"This blend is not bitter to wake you up, but a mild end that makes your mornings calm.  A delightful slow approach to a busy day.  No harsh jolts."
5,"A great way to save money on buying K-Cups - in supermarkets these go for about 8-9 bucks for 12 cups.  You save so much money buying them in bulk like this, if you use them regularly.  I just picked up the 96 count after buying the 48 count 3 months in a row."
5,Convenient way to buy GOOD coffee. 1 box last me a month and half. What a savings!!<br />Saving on gas too!!
5,best coffee from green mountain so far i recomend this to anyone who loves coffee great taste and good price make this a great buy
4,This Breakfast Blend from Green Moutain coffee company is my favorite flavor of coffee when I just want a regular cup of coffee without that extra kick from a bold blend or a flavored coffee.  It has always been consistent and calming in its flavor.  It is top-notch coffee.
5,"Usually use Timothy's breakfast blend, but the price went sky high, so we tried this brand.  Love it! Nice smooth taste, no acidity problem or burned flavor, and like the price too!"
5,I just received a new Keurig and have tried a couple of different K-Cup varieties. I just have to say that for a smooth cup of plain deliciousness this is one of my top picks!
3,"didn't get ,quite the taste i wanted,brought thru amazon. but overall will still keep using this product,until it runs out."
3,"I find that I have to use the seven ounce setting on my coffeemaker to brew this coffee, since it seems like a "" weak brew "" to us. I am going to try the extra bold for our next order."
5,I love the taste of the Breakfast Blend K-Cup coffee. You can't find a better deal<br />anywhere else. keep up the great work
5,This is a great tasting Breakfast Blend. I have been drinking it every since I purchased my new coffee maker. I will be buying more of it in the near future. Great way to start my stressful day.
5,"I have enjoyed this brand of coffee for several years now and it has been consistent in flavor!  I was happy to see that it came in a 50-count box....with cold weather approaching, I will be drinking a LOT more coffee."
5,"If you love your Keurig coffee brewer, you'll love this buy for Green Mountain 50-count Breakfast Blend Coffee K-Cups. GREAT!!!"
3,"Love green mountain coffee, but the breakfast blend was not strong or bold enough for me, will try stronger and bolder ones and get back to you all with another review, thanks"
3,I expected a little more flavor as I usually like Green Mountain Coffees.<br />Next time I'll look for a French Roast!
2,"Seems very weak.  I must be honest, I ordered the wrong coffee.  I was sad. This isn't bad as a base for an iced coffee."
5,Such a great product! Delivered fast & fresh. Can always rely in Green Mountain & kcups are great for people on the go & want 1 cup.
5,"I received the order in time. I love the blend of coffee, I use the Keurig machine every day.This is a decafe coffee, I also use regular blend."
5,Green Mountain is my favorite morning coffee.  It is a mild blend and is not the least bitter.  It is very smooth.
5,"I love the coffee mild but flavorful.  A great way to wake up and great all day.  Keurig is so easy to use, my elderly neighbor love not fiddling with the paper filters in standard coffee makers. Much easier for him"
5,"i drink nothing but green mountain k-cups,nothing can even come close to the taste.Everyone should a least try it once."
1,"Something is not right. Tastes very old. Stale. Weak. Weak at 8 ounces. Weak at 6 ounces. Strength OK at 4 ounces but tastes horrible. Not only will I not buy this coffee again, I won't buy Green Mountain coffee again. Very bad."
5,I love this coffee it's my favorite so far I want to try them all. I don't like strong coffee and I hate bitter after taste coffee to me this is the perfect cup  of coffee. I'm not telling everyone to go out and buy it this is my own opinion.
4,"this was a great product at a great price, i would recommend it to everyone that uses the kcups. its a great product"
5,"I love this green mountIn coffee it is so good my whole family drinks it, doesn't compare to other coffees, it is just right not too strong, I also buy the decaf brand."
1,both my boyfriend and I found that this coffee was way to weak and tasteless. i am back to looking for a coffee I can enjoy
5,"This is a great tasting coffee. Not only good first thing in the morning, but anytime. Very smooth. Green Mountain puts out great tasting coffee on all flavors and blends"
5,Great little plant with amazing colors. The receipt was hand signed :-) and the gift wrap was yellow tissue paper. Great plant and great seller. Thanks a lot!
5,"Yes, this is an usual flavor combination.  But the spiciness of the chili and the sweetness of the mango make a tasty combination.  This would make an excellent rim trimming for margaritas, good as a seasoning for fruit or corn, or terrific straight out of the bottle."
3,"THIS FRUIT WAS GOOD, BUT VERY, VERY SWEET.  IT IS HOWEVER, VERY PRETTY LOOKING AND WOULD MAKE A NICE LITTLE HOSTESS<br />GIFT, OR TO PUT IN A CANDY DISH FOR COMPANY.  FOR JUST SNACKING, I FELT IT WAS TOO SUGARY."
2,It might just be my preference but I don't like fruit that isn't fully dried out like this. It's very gummy and all taste the same.
4,"I enjoyed these so much, I ordered a separate bag of each flavor. Pineapple and strawberry are the best. The kiwi are #1 in the house. Try them all in this one bag."
5,"I have been hooked on Dare Coconut Cremes for over a year, and Amazon shipped them fast and at a lower price than my current supplier. Beware: I've also gained eight pounds due to Dare!"
5,Dare cookies are made in a peanut & tree nut free factory in Canada.  They are super yummy and impossible to find in Texas. I hope that Amazon continues to carry them. Dare  Maple cookies are very good too.
5,As a Canadian expat living in the USA I have been going crazy with the crap cookies down here.<br /><br />Finally found a way to bring the best cookies in the world to my door.<br /><br />Amazon Rocks !!!
5,"These are my all-time favorite cookies, and I was so excited to have a permanent supplier. Now that Amazon has discontinued them (I hope this is only temporary), I am devastated! Please make sure they are available again soon!"
5,best cookies I ever ate. I thought I had eaten the best cookie around untill I had these.<br /><br />Pat Morrow
5,These crackers are very delicious and better for your diet than flavored chips. The Parmesan & basil Wheat Thins are also fun and different. Be warned they are highly addictive!
5,"These are absolutely delicious. They have a bold flavor, which is, as another reviewer put it, quite addictive. Delicious on their own or with a delicate cheese, they take front and center on your taste buds."
3,"These are wheat thins, with some flavor added. The Flavor is very salty, and you can definitely taste the MSG that they added as a cheap way to spike the flavor. As far as i remember, you can't really taste the basil at all."
5,"love the interesting flavor<br /><br />hmm... now that i think of it, i think i used to buy chicken wraps that had a sundried tomato/basil paste<br />that combination is awesome!"
5,This is the only tea in my house. I love its peachy taste and the ginger is very subtle. I have a cup every evening to put a soothing touch on my day. I got the pack of of 6 so I would never run out! Haven't tried the other ones those are next but wanted to make sure I had enough of this one.
4,My friends and I have enjoyed this kind of tea at a resturant called P.F.Changs and I found it at a local store but much better prices at Amazon. I am enjoying it for icetea as well as hot tea. Very good tea. I split the order with a friend who also liked it and wanted some.
3,"It's Okay but I must warn that the title is misleading. It should just be called Peach Tea, as I don't taste ginger at all. That was why I purchased it in the first place, for the ginger infusion. Joke is on me!"
4,These teas are terrific. I love the Earl Grey with Lavender and the White Pear tea as well. I think the Ginger Peach may be my favorite though.
5,"This is my favorite tea - I don't normally drink black tea, but this is perfect on its own! I like to pair it with a decaf peach tea for an extra flavor boost."
5,Great aroma and fine taste. I am so happy with Amazon's subscribe and save price on this. This is our household's favorite. I wish I could find this in loose tea format.
3,Tea is okay but it's more of a peach flavor than ginger peach. I couldn't taste/smell the ginger at all.
5,"This is a wonderfully flavored tea. Not too sweet as to be overpowering peach, but enough to help mask the ginger."
5,"The first time I tasted this tea was about a year ago, and since then it has become my favorite. Never bitter, very consistent."
5,"The tea is fabulous!  However, I did request the decaf version and was sent the caffinated version.  I used it anyway.  Several of my friends also thought it was exceptional and have since purchased the tea."
5,"This is a distinctive, different and very enjoyable tea. Fragrant and highly flavorful: it's almost liqueurlike, without any alcoholic side effects of course. Good on its own or with the usual suspect additives (milk, sugar and/or lemon). Try it at work: you'll convert your fellow galley slaves."
2,"I had ordered this set thinking it was the decaf sweet ginger peach one served at PF Changes. I was wrong and instead got over 60 bags of strongly caffeinated tea. The shape is great for a teapot, but awkward for a single cup of tea."
4,"I ordered three packages of granola and expected all three to be equally tasty. They weren't. Since I cannot remember which one was not particularly good, I'm reluctant to re-order granola from this terrific company."
3,"They taste same as any other canned corn to me. Maybe I'm not taste sensitive enough, but can't understand why this is ""gourmet"". But 2 colored corns make dishes look more appealing, though!"
5,I am a raw vegan and find that the mxed sea salad is a delicious blend.  I usually eat them in a raw salad or as a soup blend in miso.
5,"This is a truly great coffee w/a strong chocolate aroma, but little to no chocolate flavor. Probably overlooked by most because it is Vietnamese. Just think about how long the French occupied Vietnam and you can only begin to understand how great this coffee is."
1,"Yuck! Awful and since I expected beans instead of ground coffee, I'm even less impressed. I have a very good quality coffee maker, but this stuff stinks."
5,"Personally did not use it, but send to people on my family and they seem to like it very much."
5,"Have Australian Shepherd,  Shelties, and a Minature Doberman and they all LOVE the Rise and Shine.  Unfotunately, the only retailer carrying this product is 50 miles away.  Thanks for stocking this item."
5,That is why he brought this down from the heavens for us mere mortals to taste.<br /><br />There's only 2 Cereals that the we've truly been blessed with. 1. Lucky Charms 2. Cinnamon Toast Crunch. I'd throw Fruitloops in there but that's a man made attempt at creating a God given cereal.
5,My kids love this cereal. They can probably live on this. I am trying not to give them too much of it due to its' high sugar content.
5,Once more Amazon was great. The product is good for kids even though it has a little bit more sugar than needed.
5,When you have kids that eat cereal day and night.  This is a great deal...The boxes came in perfect conditions.
5,Great Food! Great Price with subscribe and save saved 15% of the list price.  3 boxes go fast but they are good.
5,"I bought these for my boyfriend as a surprise present. I feel like it was a great buy and he loves it! The shipping was incredibly fast, I was not expecting him to get it so soon. Pleasantly surprised."
5,"What more can i say other than .. They're magically delicious ! .. Came fresh and fast , Great price"
5,Love that I could save gas money by not going to the grocery store to buy some food products! Thanks Amazon!
5,WOW! Not much to say. Its cereal just as if it is on the shelfs at stores but at a way cheaper price. I love these since I was a child and still eat them to this day. Got to love em'.
5,This cereal brings back memories of when I was a child. Still the same quality at a bargain price. My child loves it and so do I!
5,I used to visit Chipotle mexican restaurants just to douse my burrito with this delicious concoction. Then one day walking through the aisles of the local Safeway I happened upon the bottle on the shelf and my life hasn't been the same ever since.
5,I bought this for my roommate as a joke/housewarming gift. we were going through about 3 regular bottles a month. this solves that problem!!! its the same stuff plus a great convo starter and decoration. i recommend this to any tabasco fan
5,"I never really got into the original tabasco sauce, but the Tabasco chipotle sauce, yes, the best, great job.  For those of you who haven't tried it, you won't use anything else.  Thanks."
5,$44.39 a case? Are u kidding me? Just buy it from the East West web site for $28 a case.
5,"This sauce is worth the extra money it costs.  Tastes great on salmon, chicken and I even use a bit on my eggs in the morning."
5,"This is something I never want to be without for my dogs!<br />They are enjoyable for them, of course, but they also<br />aid in helping to keep their teeth & breath cleaner...<br />thank you."
5,My mother uses it when making the best twice baked sweet potatos:) It's also perfect on those pancakes or waffles!!!!!
5,I have my aunt ship this at Christmas time.  It is great on its own or as a creamy butter spread with cinnamon.  I certainly hope that Amazon gets it stocked quickly.  My whole family loves this stuff!
5,Kashi's brand oatmeal is THE perfect thing in the morning. I usually dislike  breakfast but this lightly sweetened and perfectly oaty one is great. I recommend it to everyone.
5,"I still think the price could be a little lower, but it is the best tasting instant oatmeal that my toddler loves."
5,"If you like black tea, this is it. No flavors added, no smokiness as you can find in Russian black teas."
5,"I have been fully pleased with ├çaykur teas for a while now including other flavors. The Alt'nbe' tastes great in my opinion. It's even good when brewed with a coffee maker, and becomes a very rich and bold flavor."
5,We love this tea.  Its the only tea my coffee drinking hubby likes.  We use a single mug type tea strainer since the tea is very fine ground.
5,Taste clean and natural without any aftertaste. I wish I have found this sooner. Has a sweet floral flavor yet remain strong. Yum
5,"For someone with a gluten problem this is the best spaghetti on the market, without a doubt."
5,I made the Notta Pasta Spaghetti tonight for the first time with a fresh fish and tomato sauce and it was wonderful. I actually prefer this pasta to wheat pasta. I do not have a gluten intolerance but will continue to buy Notta Pasta instead of wheat pasta as a matter of choice. Great stuff!
5,"This is the only brand I buy.  They make fettacine, spaghetti and linguine.  You can get their wonderful recipes online.<br /><br />Abby"
5,"This is my all-time favorite gluten-free pasta. I like that the noodles don't have a flavor that competes with the sauce (we make our own, and it is realy good!)"
5,It is very good tasting food. It is very addicting; my family and I can not get enough of it. We go through about 10 bags in about 3 days.
5,"these are outstanding products,..taste like real bread not like others that i have had that tasted like cardboard.. well worth the purchase.."
3,"This Switch Kiwi Berry drink comes is as great, easy to handle, streamlined candy.  However, it does delivery an intense, fruit, flavor.  Great when you really need a sweet fruit recovery from a hot summer day.  Otherwise, a bit overpowering. A nice treat though."
2,Was looking forward to this drink but was put off by its sweet soda-like taste.  Maybe it's an acquired taste? I'm not sure  but the high calories don't make me want to try.  Looking forward to a diet version.
4,"A little pricey for what you get , but the taste is phenomenal. No aftertaste , or bubbly annoyances , just a satisfying application to one's taste buds"
5,These are awesome. I liked the fruity soda combination. I enjoyed all the other flavors as well. I think they will be great for summer parties over ice. Very refreshing!
5,the perfect mixer for a summer vodka concoction or by itself for a sweet pick-me-up treat.  The sweetness isn't overpowering and the flavor it true to itself.  Perfect size for my kids to pick one up and have a sweet soda!
5,I really enjoyed the Switch Kiwi Berry can I received. It is full of flavor and is very good. If you enjoy energy drinks then I recommend this one.
4,"How much can you say about a drink? It tastes pretty good! It's got a nice flavor, sweet, but not overly so and there's a good amount of fizz. There's a lot of sugar for the amount of drink you have, and at only 8.3 fluid ounces, there just isn't much there. What's there is good though!"
2,"Way too heavy on carbonation. What flavors were there were too weak to detect. Sorry, but I won't be buying this one."
3,"A nice juice drink, but it just didn't grab me like other flavors did. I would probably not purchase it in the future, though I did not dislike it. Like I said, it just didn't grab me."
3,"You'll like it if you like sweet drinks.  Just a bit too sweet for me.  It has a strong flavor odor to it as well.  Doesn't really smell like strawberries or kiwi, but smells sweet."
4,"This flavor of this drink is the better of them. Really nice and sweet. Not overdone, not weak, just right. My only complaint with these drinks is that they are carbonated. I wish they weren't. But if I had to choose between this and the other... I would choose this flavor again."
5,"Chill a can of The Switch Kiwi Berry,<br />pour into pretty wine glass,<br />relax and enjoy.<br />Repeat...<br /><br />The Switch Kiwi Berry has an aesthetically pleasing color, tantalizing fruity taste, just enough carbonation, a pleasurable experience. -- Katharena Eiermann, 2009"
4,"This is a good drink, tastes like soda, but fruity.  I really liked it, nice alternative to soda."
5,"The Switch Kiwi Berry is really good.  The taste is different.  It has a nice sour taste, and also is healthier than soda due to the low sugar content."
5,This drink is a great alternative to soda. It has a little bit more sugar than soda but this has better ingredients than a regular soda can. It is a little pricey for a pack of 24 but it is better for you and it taste great.
3,"I was not overly impressed with this entry into the 'natural' soda sweepstakes. The flavor was OK, but it was achingly sweet. I enjoyed the small size, since it would be a better alternative to younger folks.<br /><br />But I would think twice because of the over-keening sweetnes."
4,I liked this flavor of theis carbonated fruit juice but I will admit that there are flavors I did like better.Also this product should be drunk very cold for maximum flavor.If you like carbonated fruit juice then this product is for you
4,This drink was pretty good to me. It has a light not too sweet taste to it and makes you want to drink more than one at a time. What was really good to me is it is light on the carbonation also. All these factors put together means i would try the drink again and recommend it to others.
5,"This is a pleasant tasting drink.<br />Sweet, fruity and carbonated. I like the fact that it's one hundred percent juice.<br />Again however, with the Switch drinks, the flavor wasn't really distinguishable.<br />It tastes great though and I really enjoyed it."
5,"The Kiwi Berry flavor has a tarty but sweet taste. Neither the strawberry nor kiwi is overpowering. Instead, I was treated to the best of both flavors! There was very little carbonation. My favorite Switch flavor!"
2,"I didn't care for this drink at all.  It's almost like eating a sweettart in liquid, carbonated form.  My husband and oldest daughter felt the same way, but my 13 year old liked it.  It is 100% juice though, which is nice to see in a carbonated beverage."
3,"The flavor combination of kiwi, and strawberry is quite tasty.  With no sugar added, this gourmet soda keeps just the right amount of sweetness about itself.  Each can is only 8.5 Fl Oz (245 mL) - so in my mind it is rather pricey."
2,"<span class=""tiny""> Length:: 2:06 Mins<br /><br /></span>-1 star for the price!<br />-2 stars for the yucky flavor!<br /><br /> enjoy the video! props to my officemate Brendan for filming."
3,You will like this drink if you're into sweet tasting drinks. The bulk of the juice is apple and grape but it does have a strawberry taste with LIGHT carbonation and it is all-natural. It's an all-natural strawberry flavored Fanta!
5,"The flavor was great, the ingredients healthy.  This was a nice, natural energy drink that I would recommend over any soda or Red Bull-type product.  If you're looking for a carbonated beverage that isn't loaded with high fructose corn syrup, this is the way to go.  Highly recommended!"
3,"While the sugar count is slightly higher than a can of coca-cola, this soda gets it sugar from 100% Fruit Juice, not from High Fructose Corn Syrup.  I wouldn't give this to my daughter every day but as an alternative to soda once in awhile I think it is a good choice!  Plus it tastes great!"
4,"Now a days when  you think of Soda most people think of unhealthy, bad for your body, stains your teeth, and the list can go on and on. Not true with the lastest soft drink craze, Switch. This carbonated soft drink beverage is the perfect blend of healthy and fun! Definitely one to try out!"
5,"This drink completely drew my taste buds into a hypnotic feeling of bliss.<br />The fruit in this drink tasted like it had been freshly picked from some exotic country, and blended to perfection with carbonation.  Delightful!"
4,I enjoyed this carbonated Kiwi Berry fruit juice.  The carbonation gave the drink a more complex taste than just plain juice.  It is also a healthy alternative to sodas with no nutritional value.
4,I like the sparking refreshing taste of Kiwi in combination with Strawberry but I probably would not sacrifice my thirst for the traditional diet free soda drinks that I got used to.
4,"Great change from artificially flavored soda, but it was almost sweet enough to be a concentrate. We mixed it up 50/50 with club soda and it was perfect!"
5,"This is a great tasting, no sugar, or other additives, alternative to soda pop. I love that it is carbonated juice only. We are used to Knudsen juice spritzers. This isn't quite as sweet as those. We love these."
4,"The switch is a nice change from soda pop, and a great alternative for children."
3,"tastes good, but a little on the sweet side.  may not be for everyone."
5,This drink had a really good flavor.  I not to sweet or too strong.  A really good refreshing beverage that i would buy again.
4,"Great idea, carbonating fruit juice. Wife & I enjoyed the watermelon strawberry version better, though; it didn't seem to have the aftertaste and slight heaviness of the kiwi berry. Nonetheless it was quite good."
4,"All three family members sampled this and found it to be refreshing, light and tasty. The can size is awesome, you can pop it in your purse and be on your way. The calorie count is huge for the size of the can however, and I wish it came in a 'light' version."
3,"Each of these Switch juice drinks seems to be about 50 percent sweeter than it needs to be. Imagine mixing Perrier, Kool-Aid and Mountain Dew together and you've got a good idea what to expect. OK, I know it's not that bad. But would somebody please tell my taste buds?"
5,Nice and sweet. Tastes like strawberry and kiwi. All natural ingredients.<br /><br />I recommend The Switch!
4,"The taste of this was like a pop but it was very refreshing to the mouth.  I liked it because it was healthier than a pop , had great taste and it was very refreshing."
3,"It tastes light and fizzy.  I liked the taste but would not 'switch' and buy this instead of my favorite juices/pop.  If someone handed it to me, I wouldn't refuse it."
3,"This drink is refreshing, but a little too sweet for me. I found that others in my household enjoyed it more than I did, so it might be more fair to give it a four star."
4,"This new refreshing drink has no sugar added, no corn syrup, no preservatives, no artificial colors and is gluten free !  It provides a convenient container of 8.3 ounces of 100 % tasty juice with plenty of Vitamin C.  If you want a nice afternoon pick-up, you'll enjoy this drink !"
5,"Great taste, solid flavor, sparlking. Good thirst quencher that is a great substitute for soda."
5,"Try it, it's great.  It has just a hint on carbonation and not enough to make me hiccup, which is what I do when the carbonation is too strong. The can is a little small for a meal but if you just want a sip or two it's great.  The flavor is the best but don't get the cherry."
5,"This little can holds big flavor.  Fruit juice, V-C and fizzy stuff, is a good way to describe it.<br /><br />My kids love it and their school's wellness program has switched over to this as an alternative to soda."
4,"I believe the label that says this soda is all-natural. But it has a sweet, candy-like taste. Not for everyone.<br /><br />I did enjoy this drink. I believe that the size (8.3 ounce) is too small for a sit-down meal. It is otherwise a good size. A drink this sweet, I would not like to fill up on."
4,"Nice refreshing beverage but with 120 cal a bit too sweet.  Good amount of carbonation, though, so very cold it would be great for a summer picnick."
5,"GREAT LITTLE DRINK,NICE FLAVOR. WILL PROBABLY ORDER MORE SOON . RECOMMENDED AS A HEALTHY ALTERNATIVE TO SODA POP."
3,"It is a good concept to carbonate juice.  The kids loved it and called it ""soda"".  It has a nice flavor but it is difficult to taste the individual fruit juices though."
5,I put this in the kids lunches for school.  They loved it as it made a nice change from straight fruit juice or UHT milk - it tasted like a soda to them but I loved that they were getting the nutrition of the fruit without the extra sugar.
4,"I tried the Kiwi Berry flavor. I really liked the taste. It was sweet but not too sweet. It had a lot of carbonation so it was bubbly.<br /><br />If you like fruit flavored soda, I think you would like this product."
4,"After the tasting of the ""Watermelon and Strawberry"" flavor I was pleasantly surprised at how good this one tasted. Imagine a carbonated juice that is 100% natural and is not overwhelming to the taste buds... this one is a real keeper! Light, Refreshing, and Great flavor keeps us coming for more!"
4,"I don't drink soda anymore and trying to be more health conscious. It has a great crisp taste like 7up, but the flavor or fruit. It almost reminds me of the carbonated fruity waters, but with more flavor. If you've ever had Jones Soda, that is the best way to describe it, but not as sweet."
4,"The Switch Kiwi Berry soda is an all natural soda. It's a little sweet for my taste. If you want to give yourself or your kids a soda treat, I'd certainly buy Switch instead of regular soda that is loaded with sugar and chemicals. Worth a try."
2,"I can't figure out why anyone would want to drink this stuff!? The can is 1/3 less in size than a regular can of soda, it's got more sugar and more calories and it doesn't taste very good. It's also a bit expensive for what your getting.......need I say more?......I think not!"
1,"I find this product to be too sweet and syrupy and consequently does not quench my thirst. The size is nice but that's the only thing I liked about it. This is a subjective review of course and other's may love this product, just not me."
5,"I tried both the Watermelon Strawberry and the Kiwi Berry drinks.  I found the taste to be light, not overly sweet, and quite refreshing.  With the 8.3 oz size there was no waste with leftover juice in a can going flat!  I would love to have this in a zero to very low calorie version, tho."
5,"Yes, you should buy these excellent fruit drinks because they taste G-RRRRREAT! (As long as price is not an object)<br />Tastes just like kiwi's and strawberries mixed in with carbonated water.<br />But the can says... 100% juice!"
5,This is a very fruity but the right amount of sweet tasting drink.<br />I love this flavor. I would definitely buy it again.
4,The fruit flavor was authentic but I found it a bit sweet.  It is what it says it is however; carbonated fruit juice.  It is a better alternative to soda if you like sweet carbonated drinks.
4,"tastes like a carbonated fruit juice that really close to soda, but not exactly.good stuff though!carbonation will still wreak havoc on your stomach though, so don't accept it as ""healthy"" just yet."
4,"Very crisp and refreshing.  if you want real juice but no caffeine and not quite the ridiculous sugar-zap of soda, this is the way to go.  It's spendy which detracts from the overall value, but if it every comes down a little, it really is delicious."
4,Light carbonation mixed with fruity blend made this a refreshing and flavorful drink.  The kiwi and berry flavors are good together.  This could be a good way to switch yourself or the kids off of soda and on to juice.
5,"So I let my girls drink this and tell me what they thought. They loved it, hand down. I liked it also and would like to grab more. The label says no artificial sugars and 100% juice. If thats true its great - it is very sweet tasting and very very flavorful. The carbonation adds a nice kick also."
5,"As a juice freak, I sample just about all of them. Any different fruit and taste is top for me. So I gave this a try, and it is among the best. So, next time you want a refreshing, tasty , and healthy drink, scoop up some SWITCH!"
2,"The Kiwi Berry drink may not have sugar addded, but it sure tastes sweet. Part of it may be the other fruit jucices mixed in (Apple, Grape, Raspberry, and Strawberry)with more Apple and Grape than Kiwi. For me it was too sweet and did not taste too much like Kiwi fruit."
4,"I like the taste of this drink.  It has a nice fruity taste, that doesn't leave an aftertaste.  I will probably order some."
1,Short on flavor and not as advertised. Says no sugar but doesn't admit to the sugar found in the concentrated juices. My teens felt it was just ok with the flavor. I did not like it at all. Is it better than drinking pop? Probably but does the high price warrant the small differences?
1,"As posted in the ""black cherry"" review, 33 grams of sugar is way too much for me but may be great for others who can handle high sugar content.  The kiwi is a refreshing taste but I could only drink a small amount because of the sugar.  Cute little can - much smaller than the typical soda size."
3,"This drink is nice and sweet with some carbonation but not as good as some of the competitors out there. BUT, it is made of real juice and that is a plus. My kids loved it!"
5,I love this drink & I don't have to feel guilty about drinking it!!!  It has NO SUGAR OR SWEETNERS!!<br />The taste is great!!  I even give it to my grandchildren. . .<br />The name speaks for itself. . . it time to SWITCH
1,I didn't like the taste of this product - couldn't finish it off because it was a little metallic tasting and had an aftertaste.
5,"This is a great soda that's not really soda. If you want natural kiwi and berry flavors, buy this item."
2,"This used to be a good product before they started watering it down, which is why I quit buying it."
5,"I figured, I'd, try a few, items, I, normally, purchase, at, the, grocery store. This, tasted, as, if, it, was, made, yesterday. High, quality item."
5,"My Mom is a great biscotti baker, she has traditionally relied on McCormick/Schiling extracts.  Since using the JR Mushrooms and Specialties extract her biscotti's tastes even better and aroma is unprecedented."
1,"The web information fails to mention the main ingredient is alcohol, with a small percentage as ""pure"" extract."
5,I first purchased this product at a store in California and I was thrilled to see it available on Amazon. It's to the point where I almost can't cook steaks with out it!  Excellent low cal product!
5,"Not a whole lot to say about peppercorns, but I'm more than satisfied with the price and service.  This was an Amazon add-on so it was a particularly good value, IMO."
5,"I ordered a pack of peppercorn to qualify for the super saver shipping. I got peppercorn. It's kinda hard to screw up. I am pleased with my peppercorn. I put it in a peppermill, and it gets ground into smaller pepper. Genius."
4,I got this as a gift for my boyfriend cuz he really likes carnivorous plants. It arrived in good health and did very well until I gave it to my boyfriend. However he did not follow the instructions on how to water it and it died... Just be sure you only give it distilled water and it will be fine
5,I have purchased four carnivorous plants from Joels. All have arrived quickly and healthy and are doing GREAT.This is a quality grower. You can buy from Joel with confidence.Highly recommend!!
5,"My son wanted a pitcher plant and after reading the reviews we decided to try this one. It arrived looking just like the one in the photo and now about six weeks later, it has about doubled the number of shoots growing from it. I wouldn't hesitate to order another plant from this dealer."
4,Lets hope I can keep it that way. I had a pitcher plant before and it died. I followed all the instructions but it never came back after winter.
5,"Crazy-great condition, was doing great until my sister accidently knocked it over while I was ""sunning"" it outside. Also, I think using filtered tap water was a bad idea because they're sensitive to salts. It's slowly recovering."
5,Arrived very quickly and in perfect shape. Instructions for care were very detailed. I am very pleased with my new plant.
5,"Just received 3 carnivorous plants- a sarracenia, sundew, and ping.  Very quick shipping, an abundance of potting material included, with all arriving healthy and in perfect shape.  Highly recommend getting carnivorous plants here."
5,"Absolute lifesaver. Needed these for a bridal bouquet and my wholesaler had stopped receiving them for the season. Joel was so accommodating, easy to communicate with and everything arrived on time and in perfect condition. Highly recommend."
5,Plant arrived packed well and very quickly.  It looks just as it does in the picture and appears to be very healthy.  I am very satified with this product.
5,"The plant was healthy and looked just like the one in the picture.  It came complete with the moss required to pot it, which I appreciated.  My two sons are thrilled with the plant, and having one is a great way to encourage a child's interest in carnivorous plants and science in general."
5,"This is absolutely wonderful coffee.  The beans, the flavor, the perfect blend.  I can enjoy this coffee at any time of the day or night!  Coffee Bean Direct hit a home run with this blend!  Kudos!"
4,"Great combination of coffee, chocolate and raspberry flavors.  Stays fresh in the bag for a long time.  A bit more astringent than I usually like, but still very good."
5,This is THE best peanut butter dessert I've ever had...a combination of creamy and crunchy in the center and with an outer shell of milk chocolate that cracks when you bite into it! Sooooo goood!!!
5,"Excellent product and arrived very quickly. I'm thrilled to be able to sit back and enjoy a steaming cup of ""memories"" from when I was in the Army and we made sure to stock up for the long winter."
5,Cannot get Cinnamon Dentyne where I live and it is the only gum I chew.  I usually stock up when I go to visit family in Canada so was thrilled to see I could get it at Amazon.
5,Smucker's is the best brand one can order for preserves.  The reason I ordered the Pineapple Preserves on line is that it is very hard to find in stores.  It has a great flavor and is quite different from other selections.
5,"Smuckers pineapple preserves are just dandy.  Thick, gooey, tropical!  Try them on pancakes with whipped creme for a very special breakfast treat."
5,"I cannot get over how much my shy kitty takes to kitty kaviar.  It has to be a staple in her diet.  She just adores, wants, obsesses the stuff."
5,I have been using the instant melon green tea for several years and truly enjoy my latte every morning. I have tried othwer brands and the are not nearly as good as the Island tea brand.
1,"This product replaced Pace's Mexican Four Cheese Salsa con Queso, which WAS the best queso dip out there.  This new product lacks the flavor of its predecessor had and the new consistency is gross.  I was very disappointed Pace/Campbells replaced a winning product with this ""dud""."
1,"Aweful, Especially compared to their old Four Cheese Queso, which our family loved. Why would they drop the old Four Cheese?"
5,"I bought these for my husband.  He really likes them.  He likes the other raviolis. But after trying this one, it is his new fav.  If it makes him smile it makes me smile."
1,"I used to say i'd never buy my groceries at a hardwhare store, but  chef boyardee is cheep there. .88/can. then they go on sale even cheaper."
1,"Everyone of the cans were severely dented and all of the dented sides were carefully placed so could not see them. The cans were shrink-wrapped and packed in plastic air bags, there was no damage to the box they arrived in, so they were dented when packed."
5,"tastes great!  awesome deal, and no dents.  packaging was perfect.  definitely not factory rejects.  all 12 cans were perfect. I will be re-ordering."
5,"Taste wise, it's as I expected for canned ravioli.  Ordered 2 cases and both cases arrived in perfect condition.  No dents and with an expiration date of Oct 2014.  Got each case for a little over $12 per case.  At a little over $1/can, you can't go wrong."
5,"I buy all of these different snack foods for my husband and when I saw these oversized ravioli with Italian sausage I couldn't leave it out.  He said it's very big, very bold and very tasty."
5,Definitely delicious! Nothing bad to say about a delicious $1 meal out of a can! Props to Chef Boyardee. They never let me down!
5,"What can ya say?<br />They're Chef Boyardee Ravioli.<br />They come in a pop-off lid can instead of the microwavable bowls (Larger portion, lower price)<br />Subscribe & Save gets an additional 15% off<br /><br />A STEAL"
5,"This is good. Lots of real Italian sausage, mild Italian sauce. I even count the tomato sauce as a vegetable."
5,"For the record, I am (cut and paste) the same info for a few of these canned goods cause it's all good and I am a single male that can cook really great meals but have not time to do so, so I don't.  Open the can, dump in a bowl, nuke it, eat it, clean the bowl, end of day."
5,"This beer brewed extremely fast for me and actually foamed over the top.  I think maybe the temperature in my house was to high (80F).  Either way, it ended up tasting just fantastic.  I am highly impressed with the ease of the cooper's beer to make and how great the always taste."
5,"wow...didn't think an extract brew would taste like that! I got this because it is easy and takes no time. That being true, comparitively to grain brew, this is not it's only draw. You wil not sacrifice taste...color...smell...or the joy of beer."
5,The recipient loved this gift. The minute they opened it they decided to have a party to taste the beer. Would give as a gift again!
1,I was disappointed with my order of 2 cans of Coopers LME. One can expired one month before I recieved it. The other can was newer but very dented and damaged. I will not be ordering cans of liquid malt extract from here again.
1,I received this product with an expiration date for last April. Didn't work well. The yeast didn't activate. I am very disappointed with this product.
5,"Being from the mitten state I like my vernors & often by it. I have to let it sit for a while before drinking it, or it makes me sneeze. Other than that it's great! I'll keep buying it because it's Made in Michigan."
4,"Received earlier than promised.<br /><br />Delicious coffee with full, smooth flavor. And this is from someone who loves good coffee and hates anything less.<br />The only gripe I have about my Dolce Brewer is they should offer jumbo packets that makes enough to fill my full size coffee cup..."
5,"I have only owned my Nescaf&eacute; Dolce Gusto machine for a little over a month and already I am ""addicted"" to the coffee drinks.<br />In my opinion the quality of this coffee is superior to regular pod brewers."
5,"If I just want a good cup of coffee, not anything fancy, dark Roast is the one I go for."
5,"Caffe' Grande Intenso is aptly named, if you like strong dark roast coffee this is it!  A full size American cup with the kick of Expresso, I love it, my wife, not so much. Price and delivery direct from Amazon can't be beat!"
3,"Must be honest to say that I enjoy the Dolce Gusto ""milky"" coffees so much, that I'm a little bias towards the plain ones.  However, as a regular coffee, this is a pretty good blend."
5,"Cafe Grande Intenso is our personal favorite dark roast blend for the Nescafe Dolce Gusto Piccolo, fast and simple way to enjoy great coffee, no loose coffee grounds mess with these capsules"
5,If you make this one on the creativa with the normal grande intenso option use a second capsule on esspresso and it's really strong yet not bitter.
5,"This coffee tastes great, a strong flavor without the bitterness found in other dark roasts!"
5,"What a great buy. Compared to the price in the store, this coffee was a steal and tastes great.  I drink it every morning. My parrot, who shouldn't be drinking coffee, screams for a sip. I am stocked up for a while. One thing in life, don't run out of coffee."
3,"I purchased this coffee as a replacement for Yuban dark roast - which is not available on Amazon, any more - and it is OK but not on par in quality with Yuban."
5,"My whole family loves these cheezies.  There is no replacement for this brand when you want a crispy, excellent tasting cheezie!"
5,"Hawkins Cheezies are far and away the best cheezie you can get.  I like Cheetos once in a while too, but don't let the Cheetos fan boys fool you. Cheetos can't hold a candle to Hawkins."
5,One of the many things I miss about Canada - Cheezies!  I'm so happy I can buy them from Amazon.  They are so good!  Much better than Cheeto's or cheezy puffs.
5,"These things are great, I love them. I have not found a cheese snack in the US that compares."
5,"By far the best snack food ever.  If you ever are in Canada you must load up on these and bring them home.  Price here at Amazon is a little rich.  Beware these can be very, very addictive."
5,"I load up whenever I go visit Canada.  And when I am not going I have my family send them to me.<br />Cheetos can never compare, they have no flavor at all compared to Cheezies.<br />Cheezies are the best, even my husband who is a die hard Cheetos fan is now converted once he tasted Cheezies."
5,Hawkins are unbelievable.  They are the best I have ever tasted.  The taste makes Cheetos look like amateurs.  I wish Amazon would offer them at a respectable price.
3,"Was dissapointed with them.  Being a Cheetos fan, I thought these would be a treat.  First couple tasted pretty good but all-in-all, I'll stay with good ole Cheetos."
1,This are hard and taste horrible - almost stale fresh out of the package.  They should be ashamed to compare these to Cheetos.  I ate 2 of these and throw the rest of the bag away!
1,"I don't taste cheese - I taste an unidentifiable chemical and a LOT of salt!  Normally I LOVE salty snacks, and especially cheesy ones, but the salt is overwhelming. YUCK! Do NOT believe the ""better than Cheetos"" hype.  My favorite snack is Cheetos, and I'm definitely going back."
1,Where is the nutrition information for this product? what may be low sugar to one's purpose may not be low enough for another...
5,He likes to see which character is on his fruit snack. Betty Crocker Fruit snacks are among the best.
5,"OK so I bought the Sam's Club Fruit Snacks thinking I could save some money.  Come on they are 5 and 2 they'll eat anything with sugar, right?  WRONG.  They LOVE the Scooby-Doo fruit snacks.  Now I just have to find poor kids that can eat the Sam's Club Fruit Snacks."
4,"I tasted this last week and thought it was excellent. The fact it has fiber is goodness. That said, I'll be going with the peach flavor because it also packs a bit of protein."
2,My son had a constipation problem when he was around 13 months.  He tried this at a family member's house and loved it.  It also helped with the constipation.  So I ordered a pack and he really did not seem interested.  Mango juice works great for constipation if your kids like the taste.
5,"I live out in the sticks so it's great that I could get sticky ric at all.  Excellent product, let it soak overnight for best results."
4,"I have no problems with this rice whatsoever, the only reason this review isn't 5 stars is because it took almost two weeks to get to me.  very tasty though!"
5,"I loved it and will continue buying it forever. It is one of my favorite foods. Love it, love it, love it!!!!"
4,Product is good and came in a timely matter. The price was way higher than at the Asian store. I found it for a 1/3rd of the price. So I can buy 3 5lb bags at the store compared to this price for the same amount.
4,Love the rice and it is very sticky! Steams nicely and tastes very good. Will buy again.
5,I've never made sticky rice before and was worried about not preparing it right.  I used my rice cooker and Voila...no problems.  It was absolutely delicious. Love the light sweetness taste.
5,"I like fluffy rice but my boyfriend loves sticky rice. Could find stick rice in the local market, so ordered this rice. Sticky rice takes more time because you have to soak it. Came out great and now my boyfriend can stick his rice to his vegetables in big balls and is very happy."
5,"Thai sticky rice is one of our favorite desserts with coconut and mangoes.  Mmmm.  I soak the rice overnight, and steam it using a steamer pot and basket lined with cheesecloth or other lint-free cloth (flour sack towel-type), with a lid over the top."
4,It's good to be able to find a quality product on-line when you do not have immediate source locally.
3,Dont know how to rate this. It shipped 2 days later than it said it would. Said I was suppose to get it by July 3. And I still havent gotten it. Im sure it will be good once I finally ever get it.
5,Great taste Like it better than the regular.  We use this product in the office break room.  Will order this creamer again.
5,"Not too dry, not too moist. Easily broken into smaller size without crumbling. Perfect for use as treat when training. Dog likes them just fine.  They will dry out some if left unsealed. We use old short pill bottle that holds maybe 10 at a time. Bag has built in ziplock."
5,"My 9-week-old standard poodle gets very excited at meal time. She gets 1/2 cup of this Natural Balance kibble mixed with a tablespoon of canned food, but when I feed her, you'd think I had just given her prime rib. I've never had a dog who got so excited about her kibble!"
3,"Organic coffee is actually good for you.  In moderation.  However, this one didn't set well with my finicky taste buds.  Ok for a trial.  Try Yuban Organic if you can find it.  It's probably just my strange tastes."
5,This coffee is wonderful!  I have tried many coffees and this is one of the best.
5,"I was a little bit concerned because some of the reviews for the other Cafe Altura Organic coffees are not very good, but I decided to try this one anyhow.  Glad I did.  This is a really great French roast - one of my favorites.  We will be buying this one again!"
5,"I've been drinking this coffee for the past month or so and it has been some of the best I've ever tasted in my life. This isn't acidic at all and on top of that, it's organic!"
5,I try to purchase organic as much as possible.<br />It makes perfect sence to consume organic coffee.<br />This coffee rates no. 1 on my list of coffee.<br />I have tried many and this one tops the list.<br />Prompt service and shipping.
3,Blah... that's all I can even come up with. There's better organic out there I'm sure.
4,Wanted to find a product that would satisfy my sweet tooth.  Not bad considering that it's a healthy form treat that is sugar free and gluten free.  Different flavors  and assorted types.  Wish it wasn't so expensive and a better deal at shipping.
4,"This is the best cat food for my feral cats! The 40 lb size is a great buy, and the cat food is good for them! you really can't beat the price for decent food for feeding a lot of cats!"
2,There's an old saying that a bargain is not a bargain if there is no use for the item. While the price of this made it seem a very attractive; it goes to waste since the cats do not eat it.
1,I bought this cat food at Tractor Supply. My cats hate this food. They won't eat it.<br />It is so hard my cat's have a hard time trying to eat it. My cats are very unhappy with this food. I would not buy again.
3,"This cat food is adequate and nothing more. It will feed your cat. My cat does not like it and I am stuck with a big bag. This is a bargain brand, and gets the job done."
5,"This is good cat food, and it came out even less expensive than Iams with the shipping included."
4,My cats have eaten this for the last year without incident.  Their most recent visit to the vet reaffirmed that my 2-year olds are doing fine on this.
5,"This cat food isn't the highest quality, but it is definitely not the worst. It's far better than any of the Purina cat chows available, all of which are offered at a similar price per pound. For the price, this is the best cat food on the market, and you can't beat free shipping!"
5,My 3 cats like the small kibble size and must enjoy the flavor as they pick aroun their old food mixed in to get to this one. I've noticed their fur seems shinier and softer.
5,I tried this out with I believe the six pound bag (or close to that size) and my cats loved it.  Upgraded to the 20lb bag and still very satisfied.  Gave my kitties meow mix in between purchases and they snubbed it.  Better keep stocked up on this!
5,"great bargain, cats love it, ad do well on it  and normally I have problems with them upchucking after eating,  they have not with this, yet.  the kibble is a bit large but I soak it in water anyhow, so it is just fine.  K Campbell"
5,"I got turned on to this product watching the Barefoot Contesa with Ina Garten on the Food Network.  Despite it's high price, this olive oil is flavorful and of the best quality I've seen in olive oil products.  I highly recommend this product by Olio Santo's out of California."
5,"The title says it all.  I'm very pleased with this olive oil.  I used to get the Fini brand when I could find it, but this is a more-than-adequate substitute."
2,Dunno where the alleged 6 Pack went. I received ONE 2lb box of biscuits.  Don't be misguided by false advertising.  On another IAMS order from another supplier received what I had ordered.
5,"This candy is so delicious! The combination of chewy licorice and creamy fruit/coconut is perfect. It is addictive, though, so pass' auf!"
5,Yummmm. Sat at Cafe's along Lago D'Como eating vanilla ice cream with this syrup on top in '01. I fell in love with the cherries and strong taste of cherry syrup....it's a taste sensation...watch out you could get addicted
5,"Very tasty and great to give to people. My family knows nothing aboout Japanese candy, and even they got excited when I ordered some. For some reason, some people hate green apple, but it is my favorite flavor!"
5,This delicious candy really tastes like green apple.  Full of flavor and the texture is almost like bubble gum.  A yummy treat.
5,"Hi-Chew is a favorite in our family.  You can buy directly from Japan if you have to have the wrapper in Japanese; otherwise this is the same great, chewy candy."
5,"These fabulous little red pearls are even better than Craisins!  Plump, juicy and perfect in banana bread.  The semi-tart cherry flavor has body and a definitive taste.  Will buy these again and again. Great surprise."
4,"this is a yummy, kind of tart dressing - great on salads."
4,Was what we were buying locally.  Always very good.  And now at better price
5,Our first use of Farro and it was delicious. Like a sweet nutty barley. The quality was excellent! We had read about this grain in several vintage Italian cookbooks.
5,Using French's Mustard during the summer time on barbecue hot dogs will make your summer more tasty with your food.
5,"I fell in love with these delightful candies when a friend brought them back from a trip to Germany. A perfect combination of chocolate, cream, and crispy wafer.  About three perfect bites!"
5,It is very strong and pure! you just need a little bit to get a great flavor. Helps with digestion but the smell is strong!!
4,I was a biscuit and gravy person before I found out that I was gluten intolerant.  This is the best biscuit mix I have found so far.
5,"delivered on time for v day, packaged very well with instructions.  very fresh and beautiful roses. great color and size."
5,My dog loves these!  She eats them like Tic-Tacs. Don't know if they actually make her hips feel better but her attitude is great.
4,This is a great meal choice when you simply do not have the time to cook. Microwaveable bowls saves time on having to do the dirty dishes. The only drawback I see are the bowls are a bit too small. Would like to see Chef Boyardee make bigger bowls.
5,I bought the Chef Boyardee Variety Pack for my son who is in college.  The variety pack is a welcome quick fix meal for him during finals and before he heads off to work or classes.
4,Just without the need for a can opener and stove to prepare it.  Peel it and nuke it.  Done.  Eat.
5,"This brought me back to elementary school days.  Smack, crack & eat.  yum.  One problem here in hot Florida - needs to be refrigerated to eat properly!"
5,My cousin brought a nostalgia box of candies from our childhood to a family reunion.  The box had everything I remembered except Bonomo's Turkish Taffy.  I finally found it.  It tastes just like I remembered it.
5,This is a great price.  The taffy is the best; absolutely delicious.  An amazing vanilla flavor which means I will eventually have them all.  They ship next day in some cases.  I LOVE THIS STUFF!!!
5,Taste is exactly as I remember it in the 50s and 60s. Hats off to the people who brought it back. Don't forget to brush your teeth!
1,This product was certainly not worth the money. The formula is not as it was when I was a kid. Even frozen this bar would not crack like it used to. Igt is soft and way too sweet.
5,Can't find this taffy anywhere else.  Thanks for reviving another childhood memory for me!  I loved this stuff as a kid and missed it all the years they didn't make it.
1,"The taffy was not good.  Seemed to be old, somewhat sponge like.  Wrote to the company and have been taken care of.  Appreciate the good customer service.  Thanks"
4,"I was so excited to find Bonomo's vanilla taffy again. It was my favorite candy 50 years ago. These were almost too fresh. I'm letting them ""cure"" for a while. Still delicious, though."
1,"THIS WAS THE WORST FOOD LET DOWN OF MY LIFE!@! THIS IS MADE FROM MODERN JUNK THAT THEY DECIDED TO CALL BONOMO TURKISH TAFFY BECAUSE THEY BOUGHT THE NAME. IF YOU WANT THE REAL THING, MY WIFE IS FROM OHIO AND WE GOT FRENCH CHEWS AND THEY ARE EXACT! EVEN THE POWDER COATING."
5,This is the 2nd royal blend style of rice I have tried and it is delicious. Has a lot of texture. My children love it as well.
5,"This is a really delicious combination. I use a rice steamer, and it works perfectly."
5,"This rice is just really really good.  I like to add some sliced mushrooms, a little celery salt, and some toasted sliced almonds and cook with with vegetable stock.  It's wonderful and very easy.  It takes a long time to cook though...."
5,"My rice cooker never turned out rice the way I liked it until I tried this rice. Comes out perfect, is healthy, and tastes great."
4,"This rice is very easy to make, and very good.  However, the directions call for 2 1/2 cups of water.  Use 2 cups - otherwise it becomes a little soggy."
4,"This was my second purchase of this product, my husband likes to eat healthy and loves this rice blend.<br />Will place another order soon, if you enjoy wild rice you will enjoy it, we can't find it in our local supermarkets any more, so I order here."
5,This rice has a nice taste and the whole family loves it. I would recommend to anyone who likes rice.
5,"My local store discontinued this selection of Royal Blend rice. Very healthy, makes a tasty side dish cooked with chicken broth, mushrooms, peppers, etc.  Four will last us a good while as I also use other selections (still available locally), but just put three in the freezer."
5,"Ordered rice for my wife, I got the wrong blend but she likes it anyway."
5,This is my favorite rice product and could not find it anywhwere locally after my grocery store stopped carrying it. Thanks Amzon for all your GREAT variety in the products you carry.
1,"I bought this extract to use in a pumpkin beer, but I would have ruined the batch. This stuff is gross!"
5,"Very reasonable price for an outstanding product. Checked<br />many other retailers locally and online. I can honestly say without a doubt, that I received the best value for the 20 pack coconut bars!"
5,"these bars are very filling and very tasty!  I originally found them at Marshalls and was thrilled to find them in bulk here on amazon.com.  They're great for on the go days, and they really are filling."
5,"I bought a 5-bar box from Home Goods, of all things. I had never had one before. Vegetarian and Gluten Free and it tastes as good as some candy bars to me. Higher fat content than I'd like (Total Fat 14g, Sat. Fat 12g) but calories are only 246. I will definitely eat these often, just not everyday."
5,"These are great, the perfect mix of coconut and sweet.  My wife dislikes coconut, but the Oskri bars are making her a convert."
5,"These coconut bars ares so delicious, soft and moist. Fantastic product and very good for you. I love these for breakfast along with my protein shake (-;"
5,"These bars are delicious and healthy.  I enjoy eating them year round.  However, they do not keep well in the heat, so order only in the cooler months unless temperature regulated storage and shipping is available."
4,"These bars are great, this was my second order and the second box seems to be more stale.  The first box contained bars that were so fresh and soft and this second box contains bars that are not as white, soft or fresh.  They have a later expiration date but the products are not as fresh."
5,My 3 children love them. I love them. They are delish with dark chocolate covered almonds. Coconut has such great health benefits. A great way to take advantage of the benefits. My kids think they are candy bars.
5,"If you know of people that have regularity problems; have them try a coconut bar a day. Has made a difference in everyone so far. We have them in house always. We like the almond, pineapple, and mango.Great fiber scource apparently. I highly recommend them!"
4,"Really tasty, similar to a Mounds Bar or Almond Joy but without the nuts or chocolate, so I think it is really tasty.  There are 230+ calories for one bar and not a lot of protein (1.3 grams)so keep that in mind when you decide to eat one. Good Luck..."
4,Great bars for someone looking for a natural energy bar. No fake sugars in these bars! Great to throw in a suitcase or backpack when traveling.
5,"These are so good, chewy and just the perfect amount of sweetness. I try to follow the Paleo Diet as close as I can and consider these a minimal cheat. Kind of like a Mounds bar without the chocolate . . . and sugar!"
5,"If you love coconut, you will love these bars.  I feel like they taste like coconut macaroons without the chocolate.  I absolutely love them.  They have no artificial ingredients in them and they taste phenomenal!!!"
1,I am disappointed in these-- they taste greasy and I can't return them!<br /><br />They have 11 gm of fat and 9 gm of saturated fat!
1,"these chips were way overpriced for what you get.  i bought them for a special recipe, but in retrospect could have used andes candies and saved a bundle."
5,"I bought it for my mom. She first time tried pepper stuffed with feta cheese long time ago as a gift from Europe. Now I can find it for her from Amazon, very happy. Thank you."
5,These are so delicious!!! The flavor is extraordinary and totally make your salad a winner every time!!!! I highly recommend them to anyone who loves salads and olives a great combo!!
5,best i ever had. can't live without it now. can't wake up tomorrow and have another bowl. i've started adding fruit.
5,I just had one of these bars today and I got to tell you it was good. Kind of like an Almond Joy candy bar w/o the almonds but awesome good. I am planning to buy some of these bars along with some of their other products.You will not be dissatisfied.
3,"These bars are all natural and taste so good. And if your on a Weight Watchers diet, these bars are worth 5 points. The only down side is that arrive in the mail melted. I wish the seller would pack these in ice so they arrive in tact but that might be a dumb idea."
1,This product is old. the chocolate crumbles and it looks old. Maybe not stored properly? I could not return item as it is a food item and could not conveniently see how to get a refund. We have had this product fresh and it was wonderful. This was not wonderful by any means
1,I would like to tell this company that the whole box of bars had melted and then it was so crumbly to eat it was a mess I don't want to spend the money to send them back it's so expensive but wish they would send me another box that was not melted and falling apart. What do you do about that?
5,"I have been buying these bars (without chocolate) for years and have recently found them with the chocolate.  Our family of six loves them.  They are a great bar to hold you over and give you extended fuel, made with great ingredients to boot.  I highly recommend you try a box!"
5,"i used to buy these at sam's club, they don't carry them anymore, now i have to buy them online, need i say more."
5,"I love this seasoning.  It is great to rim a glass that is filled with a yummy Mango margarita!  And of course, on fruit and veggies of all types.  Love the sweet, tangy and savory aspect of this product. Yay and thumbs up on this seasoning!"
5,"I use this on veggies, meat, and about everything. It is especially good on veggies and chicken. Would be great on fish also, but I have not tried it. My wife makes a chicken in white sauce with this seasoning that is out of this world. I have used it on beef and pork and it is great!"
5,"We use it on everything; fish, meat, salads, vegetables!  All our friends and family love it!  I gave it all away and need some more!"
5,"I have really fallen for flavored coffees and I consider these to be some of the best-- so much so that I'm on the regular shipment list now.  I'm sure I drink too much of this but I love the flavors.  Try it, I'm sure you'll like it."
3,"One packet is only good for 6 cups, not a full pot as the directions state. If you put in any more water, the coffe is too weak."
5,"since this has caffeine, i normally take this with me to work to share with my co-workers.  we all like it very much."
5,This was a very good product at a very good price. Can't find this flavor at every grocery store and it is good to know I can get it quickly on line.  Thanks for offering this product.
5,"I love Crystal Light. It has helped me to shed 45 pounds over an 11 month period, as the taste is so good I stopped drinking Sodas and sweet drinks as I had done for so long. And the price was very affordable to boot."
4,"This is a good value and nice mix of flavors. The lemonade, pink lemonade and cherry pom are great flavors, but strawberry is way too strong. You can use half a packet and get just as good of flavor with almost all of these."
4,"I purchased this tub to take to work, as I like to drink my water with a little flavor.  I enjoy the flavor variety and couldn't find this tub pack anywhere else. The price seemed fairly reasonable for what I got."
4,Great value.  I drop several of these in my purse or travel bags and have great tasting water when I want more than just water and my Dr. approves!!!
5,"THIS IS ANOTHER CRYSTAL LIGHT PRODUCT I AM ENJOYING. IT'S ALSO ALMOST GONE. I'M WORKING ON THE LAST TUB IN THE CASE. I'LL BE BACK FOR MORE. IT TOO, IS ANOTHER AMAZON VERIFIED PURCHASE."
5,"I gave up cystal ligh tten years ago, the taste was so bad. This is so good! the packages makesmall amts, but oh wow, in the blender with ice! I am hooked, wish amazon had the quart size."
5,This sampler pack is very convenient. We've purchased twice now and have enjoyed having a variety of Crystal Light. My husband's favorite is the lemonade and mine is the wild strawberry. The only request I'd make - I'd love to see a variety pack that includes a decaf tea :)
4,"I like the crystal light on the go variety pack, 44ct packets per tub, good price. Just right for a serving of 20oz or more if you like it a little more diluted. I perfer it this way myself."
1,I can't believe that I got 5 whole pounds of this sour and old-tasting coffee.I might as well have bought a store brand of coffee!
5,"We have giant breed dogs who are allergic to corn, wheat, and soy.  This food is perfect and even better that I can now buy it on-line instead of going to specialty dog food stores around town."
5,"Honestly, it's good food. My dog eats 1/4 of a can with each meal (mixed with kibble) and he loves it. He's a 3-year-old male Ridgeback, and he looks great. He's healthy, has a nice coat, and eats well."
5,"I first had this tea in a restaurant, immediately I tasted the natural sweetness of this tea. It was not a bitter tea,nor was it too sweet. It was like the perfect cup of tea."
5,I've never tasted a creamer I've enjoyed as much as the Coffee-Mate Vanilla Caramel Creamer. It makes every cup of coffee I drink seem like a special treat. It doesn't take a whole lot of this creamer to get a whole lot of flavor. I love it!
5,This is the only coffee creamer that I will drink in my coffee. I use about one can every two weeks or so. I love it.
4,Not much to say- good stuff.  Amazon's grocery concept is great and I look forward to ordering more.  Now if only they offered Coffee-mate's Vanilla Chai Spice creamer.  That is some amazingly delicious powder right there.  Try it if you haven't yet!
5,"I have never been able to drink black coffee so have always had to add a sweetener. Now all I have to add is my Coffee-Mate Vanilla Caramel Creamer. It makes my morning coffee smooth, creamy and just the right sweetness. Can't live without it!"
5,I normally drink my coffee black; but I discovered this combination at a station store.  This Coffee-mate flavor works great with Torani sugar-free caramel syrup to satisfy this coffee drinker's sweet-tooth with coffee.
5,"We have trouble finding this at the supermarket and it's a bit cheaper theu Amazon.com. Plus, of course it's convenient."
5,The product arrived on time and is very good. I will order more in the future.
5,"these are lower in fat and calories than chips and seem to satisfy better than regular chips.  Try them, you'll like em"
5,"Great price for 240 pieces in total. It's sweet, chewy, fat gum. Great for blowing bubbles with and giving to kids, though loses it's flavor fairly quickly."
3,"I followed the recipe exactly. After freezing them, I have to admit, I used a butter knife to try to cut it and I BROKE the KNIFE!  Ha!  Nonetheless, they were yummy!"
5,"These brownies are delicious, period.  I didn't even follow the instructions (forgetting to whip the eggs before I added them) and they turned out wonderful. If only all gluten free products tasted this great!"
5,I was so surprised how wonderful these brownies taste. They are definitely superior to the standard wheat version. I also cut and freeze them and they are still great. It is nice to know gluten-free can beat mainstream mixes on taste.
5,"This product is great.  I thought I would never be able to eat<br /><br />a great tasting Brownie again, boy was I wrong.  Taste just the<br /><br />real thing!"
5,"These brownies were so incredibly good and moist that even if you didn't know they were gluten-free you were gobbling them up. They taste just like ""regular"" brownies."
5,"These are so good, most people don't even know they are gluten-free.  Very rich and chocolatey.  My daughter loves them!"
5,"The best gluten free brownie mix I have found.  Makes soft, chewy brownies.  The entire family loves them, even my teenager.  I made them and sent them to my celiac and non-celiac kids in the service.  Noone could tell the difference from the regular ones I use to make."
4,This product has a great taste.  I had to cook it an additional 5 minutes over what is called for.  Perhaps it's more humid here in Florida than in other parts of the country.  I really enjoyed this product though..........
1,"Kids thought it was just ""okay"", but I did not like it at all.  Odd taste.  Love their white cake/cookie mix.  That's fabulous."
5,"These are absolutely my favorite brownies. I enjoy a rich chocolate taste, so if you prefer a watered down milk chocolate effect, keep on looking. It is important to not overbake them so that they are still fudgy in the middle. They taste better than any other mix I have ever tried."
5,"This product tastes great.  The only problem I have it is that my son, who is not gluten intolerant, eats most of the brownies before I get a chance to."
5,You can't tell this from the wheat brands. Mix makes a wonderful moist brownie. I sometimes add nuts. These are wonderful. Can be made ahead and frozen for a fast treat later or for lunches. Really wonderful Products.<br /><br />The whole family really love these.
5,My husband and I loved these brownies!  I never would have believed they were wheat free if I hadn't made them myself.
5,I tried Pamela's brownie mix first and found the brownies to be tasteless and chalky. NOT THE GLUTEN FREE PANTRY BROWNIES! Everyone - even the non GFers LOVE these brownies. I serve them on holidays and people can't tell the difference.
5,My husband who doesn't have to eat gluten free even loves these brownies.  He is picky and he prefers this over Pamela's.  Our 2 kids and myself have to eat gluten free and this is our favorite store bought mix for brownies.  It is very good with some vanilla ice cream.
5,This is a great product. The price is really good compared to the off the shelf in the store price. It tastes like regular brownies.
5,This mix is very good and you cant beat it warm with ice cream!<br /><br />These were very tasty and enjoyed by ALL!
3,I have tried several gluten-free brownie mixes.  Pamela's brownie mix is a lot better than this one.  I found this to be a little bitter.
5,"This is, without a doubt, the best gluten free brownie product available.  For some reason, I'm having trouble finding GF Pantry products in my area so am grateful to be able to have a case shipped.  I highly recommend this product. Even my non GF friends think they are the best."
3,"These were the BEST brownies and then the company was sold. Cheaper ingredients make for lesser brownies. I am ticked off that we celiacs, etc are paying BIG $$ for a product that is now being mass-produced and with lower quality ingredients. Shame on you. They are still good..not great."
5,I didn't miss gluten with these.  If you are looking for ooey gooey brownies these are the ones.  Excellent - will be buying again.
5,"These are the BEST gluten free brownies ever! I have tried many gluten free items and some taste really bad, but not these!  I love them!"
5,I'm just starting g-free; I was expecting the food to taste weird/different. Well these are better than wheat brownies. I'd serve these to company in a second - and they'd just think they're really good brownies. Very highly recommended.
5,These gluten free brownies are so good (especially with dark chocolate frosting) that even my friends and family who eat wheat request that I bring<br />them to all functions!
5,These brownies are AMAZING!  Better than most regular brownies I've ever had!  My cousin made them for me when I went to a party at her house.  Everyone was eating them and commenting on how good they were before they knew they were Gluten Free.<br />Try them...you'll like them!
5,"I almost never follow directions completely, and with this mix I used half the butter called for and substituted the remainder with a natural peanut butter. Also I added some chopped pecans as well. It's a favorite in my house."
5,Yummy--you' never know they are gluten-free. My son asks me to send these to him in his college care package. The best.
5,"This mix makes the best brownies, you can not even tell they are gluten free. My husband would not even try them when I said they were gluten free. I put a bite in his month and then he proceeded to eat 2 more brownies."
5,"I baked them for the first time today, and my whole family loves them.  I will definitely be making these alot."
5,These GF brownies are the best out there!  You could fool any non-GF person...they are just that good!  Totally in love.
5,"I do not have food allergies, however, a friend does & I purchased these for her.  I made a box for my family first to try them out, and was very impressed. The brownies had great flavor, & were incredibly moist.  I am definitely looking forward to making them again!"
5,"Absolutely delicious!  Compare them with any other mix, gluten-free or not, and these are the very best, hands down."
4,"My entire family, even those who aren't on the gluten-free diet, love these brownies. Each box only makes about an 8"" x 8"" pan, so they go really fast."
5,"I can make some really good brownies from scratch but if you want to save time, you can't find better brownies in a box than this. Chewy, rich and moist with a crunchy crust - people who don't have to eat gluten free keep asking for them."
5,These are by far the best Gluten Free brownies I've had. As a previous reviewer stated... 'if only all GF free food was this good'!!
5,"I ordered this for a co-worker and she absolutely LOVES the brownies. She said as soon as she takes them out the oven she eats them, they don't have a chance to go in the freezer like recommended."
5,"The Brownie Mix is a great base for cheesecake, creamcheese, cool whip stuff, etc. The brownies are great, the whole family loves them, not just those who need a gluten-free diet.  MAKES A GREAT GIFT!!!!!"
5,These brownies turn out much like their gluten containing counterpart.  My 6 yr. old son isn't able to decipher a difference.  I would highly recommend.
5,This is a really good mix.  They really are as good as the wheat brownies.
5,I baked up a pan and could not keep the non gluten frees out of the pan! I actually got to freeze a couple of squares and they were just as wonderful as out of the pan.  Quite impressed with the taste.
5,"Quick, easy, order and shipping. Wonderful product for those of us that need gluten free foods. Even my friends and family love these brownies. Those I haven't told don't know the difference. Easy to add lots of nuts and other things. YUM!"
5,These are just about the most sinfully delish brownies I have ever had..I made them with applesauce substitution and no one noticed they were fat free.....gluten free pantry makes the best mixes
5,These SOOO taste like the real thing!! They were so good I couldn't keep my non-celiac boyfriend out of them. Will but them again and again...
5,"Whether you need to eat Gluten-free or not, these are great brownies.  Moist and full of flavor.  We took some to my kindergartner's graduation and the dissapeared quickly."
5,Delicious fudgy brownies.  We tried the oil-instead-of butter option.  It was very good.  I added a tablespoon of leftover coffee to the batter and toasted walnuts.  My non-celiac husband requests more brownies!  I love a mix the whole family likes and we all can eat!
5,"These are very delicious and taste even better than gluten brownies.  I would definitely freeze before cutting, as suggested on the box."
5,"Finally a gluten free brownie mix that makes ""real"" brownies.  These come out moist and delicious!  My father-in-law eats half the pan by himself when I make them and he doesn't follow a gluten free diet.  I highly recommend these!"
5,Everyone who has tried these say they are to die for.  Best brownies they ever had.
5,These brownies are a pretty good substitution to regular brownies.  They're nice & chocolate-y!  I've served them to some friends who aren't on a gluten-free diet & they say they wouldn't have known the difference if I didn't tell them.  I recommend them!
5,This is one of the best gluten-free things I've tried -<br />I'm just sad that it's currently out of stock - bring it back!
5,"These brownies are moist and flavorful.  In fact, they are so good that my son and his friends ate the whole pan before they were cool.  No-one knew that they were gluten-free!"
5,"No one ever notices a difference between these brownies and those made with wheat flour. They are moist, chocolatey, and delicious."
5,"I LOVE these.  I make them, cut, wrap and them and freeze them.  Zap in the microwave and you will have the best brownie ever!!!"
5,Enjoy gluten-free brownies that taste just like regular ones.  Amazon can't even keep these in stock because they sell so quickly!
5,"I have tried these and this is a very good mix, I add more chocolate chips and they were very chewy and moist."
5,These are wonderful gluten free brownies.  I have brought these to social gatherings and people have raved about these not knowing that they were gluten free.  We have tried other brands of brownie mix and they just don't compare with these!
5,"If you like chewy, gooey brownies - these are absolutely wonderful.  My whole family agrees that this is the best mix I've tried - GF or wheat-based.  I'm going to try the muffin & scone mix next!  Thanks :)"
5,"This is the best brownie mix we've found. Too bad Amazon can't keep them in stock. --Or maybe it's a good thing, since I go way over my RDA of sugar and fat whenever we bake a batch. Great to take along on ski trips or long hikes."
2,"This mat is worthless. It is tiny and doesn't stay put so the cat still gets litter every where. Like others said the mat is uncomfortable and the cat just jumps over it. So instead of having litter right in front of the box, she tracks it all over the room. Don't buy!"
2,"Cute, inexpensive litter mat.  However, the side curled up and will not flatten down, plus it will not stay in place on our Linoleum floor."
5,Keeps litter off the floor and is easily cleaned when compared to other type of mats.
2,Needs to be at least twice the size it is to be effective. When the cats did manage to step on it after leaving the box it did a good job of collecting litter that I could dump back into the litter box.
5,"My kitty is a little messy so I needed one of these. All the local pet supply stores do not carry these any more. I was happy I found this seller on Amazon.com. Mpw my rugs can continue to be saved.  Product is as advertized. Very durable, I even wash it in the washing machine on cold water. : )"
5,"Catches litter well for the first couple days, then it must be vaccuumed, but that is very easy to do."
4,This is a perfect mat for whenever your cats leave their litter box.  It keeps the litter contained to one area instead of being tracked around the box.
3,"Works very well, but I found the same product at walmart for 5 bucks, quality good, price not so much"
1,"This little mat has little points that stick out of it.  My cat does not like to step on it and has begun to try and jump out of his box, causing litter to be spread everywhere.  Do yourself and your cat a favor and do not buy this."
2,I have older mats that have a ribbed surface and work great. These have small stiff points and actually hurt to lean on or kneel on. I can imagine that they hurt my cats paws ad that is why they tend to jump over them when exiting the littler box.
3,"The mat is OK since it does not cost much.  However, I did NOT want blue.  It was supposed to be Silver.  It does not match my room.  Maybe some people don't mind that but I was a little upset when I opened the package and it was blue. I probably would not have bought it."
1,Very poor quality for the price.  There was no flavor to the crabmeat; way over processed.  Was very surprised how easily the crabmeat lumps practically disintegrated into flakes when preparing crabcakes. Learned my lesson - pay a bit more at the grocery store for quality jumbo lump crab meat.
1,"I bought these because I could not find them in any store and had always had them growing up. The price was very high, and the product was stale. Not worth the extra effort to get them."
5,Yummy!!!  These are not sold in any stores in Mississippi!  My wife loves them!  These are great!!
5,This is the best pancake mix we've ever tried.  The whole family loves it.  It's certainly worth the extra $$ over the regular grocery store brands.
5,My got the first round of these as a gift and I was elated to find them on Amazon. They are wonderful!
1,Got this same 4.4 lb bag at PetSmart for $6. Not a good price Amazon! Our dog loves it though.
1,"I ordered this as it is the food I always use and pay $52 for the large bag, didn't realize I was getting the small 4.4 lb bag.  This is not a deal.  It is higher than I pay at the pet store!"
5,I adopted both my girls from shelters and they were eating regular old dog food. Their coats were dull...but  didn't realize how dull until they started eating the AvoDerm. This stuff is amazing. They love it and their coats are so soft and bright.
1,"At first glance I thought what a great deal, then I read some of the other reviews and looked a little closer.  This claims that the regular list price is $51 for a 4 pound bag?<br /><br />GIVE ME A BREAK!  Seriously, Amazon????"
5,vavoderm great dog food buy this for my bulldogs met a rep from this company at petsmart he told me about the product gave me a few coupons tried it out would recommend highly.
5,"Slips easily into bag & is a great snack on-the-run.  But be aware, it contains two servings & plan accordingly.  Love the ""Auto Ship"" & it gets cheaper the longer you stay with it!  Good deal!"
3,there were grinds floating in my coffee every time I used one of these pods.  Did not seem to have that with other brands
5,AWESOME!!!!! 80 cups about 62 cents a cup!!!! Will order again. very quick delivery. Great quality of coffee. Not to strong but full bodied.
5,"Very smooth coffee, no bitter aftertaste, this is my favorite of all the K-cups. Shipment arrived quickly and was well packaged. Would definitely buy again."
5,This is by far the best coffee we have tried so far and we have had at least ten different coffees
5,Newman's Special Blend if by far my favorite k-cup selection. I enjoy the bold taste as I am also an espresso drinker.
5,"Of all the K-cups I have tried....this is the very best.  Never bitter and always strong enough for the good bold flavor to come thru. I've tried others that were listed as Bold, but they lacked depth and had a bitterness to them. SO,  for me it's Newman special blend all the way!"
5,Picture and Description DO NOT AGREE which is it?<br /><br />I am looking for Newman's Own Organinc Extra bold<br />second generation (same as picture)<br /><br />But the Description states Medium Roast.<br />Are they both the same or is the Picture and Description two DIFFERENT coffees?
2,I have ordered this blend several times & liked it.<br />This shipment was bitter. Maybe it was just a bad batch or maybe old.
5,Newman's own K-cups are the best i have tasted in about a year and a half of owning a Keurig. They brew strong but not bitter and don't  have the plastic/chemical taste of some k-cup blends. Great product.
5,"Wow, I tried this coffee and it was love at first taste for me !..lol..  It is rich, flavorable and strong, but not too strong.  It is the best coffe I have tasted in a long time. I use a hazlenut creamer and both flavors are great together.  Try this one. It is delicious !"
4,"This organic Keurig coffee, tastes pretty good and the price is pretty good too. The bulk purchase is necessary to get a better price. So be sure you have room to store this many k cups before you buy."
5,I love this coffee. I like a strong coffee and this is just right for me. I will order this again.
5,"Been drinking coffee in resturants too long, forgot what a good cup of coffee was like.<br />I have liked all the Green Mountain Coffee blends."
5,Delicious coffee that came quickly and conveniently to my office.  All of the cups were intact and I saved money.
4,"I bought this because of the ""medium roast"" but noticed after I got it that it's actually ""extra bold."" It is dark and intense, but not bitter."
5,"This is my favorite ""plain"" coffee for my Keurig, I really prefer all the different flavored ones. I got it super fast with no mistakes! :)"
5,This coffee is great; not too strong and not too light. It's a great way to begin or finish the day.
5,We have tried many kinds of coffee and keep coming back to Newman's Own.  I love ordering from Amazon!  Coffee right to your door!  Can't beat that!
5,"Great coffee any time of day, bold but not bitter. Great flavor. One of the best of Keurig K Kups"
5,"I got these at the suggestion of a friend.  Glad I did!  I use the medium amount of water on my Keurig, but someone who doesn't want a really dark coffee would enjoy it even using more water.  I've already gotten more of these!"
4,"This was the first time I ordered K Cups from Amazon, arrived quickly and I really liked the Medium roast Organic Blend By Newman, I liked the Decaf also and will drink it but only if I do not have Timothy's decaf I liked it better. jgibson"
5,"We have had our Kourig coffee maker for several years now. My wife likes to try different flavors (right now German Chocolate is her choice) and I will occasionally have a cup of decaf at night. But Newman's has always been my favorite. It is just a great tasting, bold cup of coffee."
5,This is some of the very best coffee I have ever tasted.  It's strong enough without a bitter aftertaste and the Decaf is just as good!  Way to go Newman's Own!
5,Everything was wonderful!  arrived quickly and everything was just fine!  ...what a world!  I really enjoy this coffee and it taste good too.
5,"Newman's Own Extra-bold is about the only K-cup that gives us the nice bold taste we like.  And, I like the fact that Paul Newman's product profits go to support camps for kids!"
4,"This one is really tasty, well blended, flavorful; all in all a great choice. Just a little too pricey for my blood, so I've moved to the coffee people brand. However, I don't think anyone will be disappointed in the cup of coffee these k cups make."
5,Great Coffee! Great Price! Great Vendor! My wife loves this coffee and the convenient pack for the Kuerig makes it easy to use and enjoy!
3,"I have yet to find a favorite coffee for Keurig Brewers.  Seems none of them are strong and flavorful enough.  This is good/okay, but I am still left wishing for a better option."
5,"If you are looking for a good flavored coffee, not too strong yet not too weak, this is it.  Great price on Amazon and well worth the money for all of you coffee lovers."
5,"From the first cup, I was impressed with the full flavor and aroma. This is a consistent coffee that always presents a good cup of coffee.. The fair trade feature is welcome as well..."
5,"I love Keurig coffee.  I can't always get the flavors I want in the store, so I shop Amazon.com.  The coffee is always fresh.  I am going to order more as soon as I finish this review.  You can always count on Keurig and Amazon."
5,This is one of my favorite bold coffees.  It is bold yet smooth and so far it has been very consistent.  I know some of the other coffees I've had there are some good and some bad shipments but this one hasn't disappointed me yet.
5,"This is by far my favorite K-cup.I like my coffee strong, and this does the trick! It has a very smooth flavor with no bitter after taste. 5 Stars!"
5,"I've tried several others but, because of its good reviews, I ordered Newman's (and also because I like all other Newman's).  It's as bold as advertised."
5,"We've found that 3 of the bold coffees in a large blender with milk, ice and a dab of peanut butter make a to-die-for frozen latte drink--and it's much cheaper than Starbucks. I may, however, have to switch to automatic coffee delivery because we use so many k-cups. Love 'em..."
5,"I have tried many different types of these coffee's and Newman's Own is by far superior. Strong, mellow, smooth and consistant."
1,"I bought this coffee because of Mr. Newman's charity. Boy, was that a misguided decision. The coffee is bitter, but the worst attribute is its muddy, sludgy mouth feel--which is the hallmark of poor quality beans. I just threw away about $35 worth...words to the wise."
5,NEWMAN'S OWN SPECIAL BLEND IS A GREAT CUP OF COFFEE. AND I REALLY LIKE THE WAY THE PROFITS ARE DISTRIBUTED TO CHARITY. GREAT COFFEE... GREAT PERSON WHO GAVE BACK... GREAT PURCHASE.
5,The coffee is strong and not bitter.  Also it is priced right.  I believe some of the revenue from this product goes to help the needy.
2,"i like a darker roast i guess. Its ok, prob would not buy again. i brew it on the middle selection on the keurig, not the full cup."
1,"To be honest, although I've always enjoyed anything with Paul Newman's name on it and have always reordered things, this time I would not. I really like coffee. This reminded me of instant."
1,I buy most everything from Amazon BUT not coffee K cups.[...] has this product and all K cups for $13.99 per 24 and free shipping and they ship air UPS.
1,The 80 count pack is incorrectly advertised as costing .01 per count...That would make the package cost 80 cents...not close to 50 dollars
1,I am still waiting for my order. It has been over a month and still nothing has come. I have other orders i made weeks after that have come.
1,"I've had my Keurig for about two years.  I drink one cup every morning.  Every time I run out of a type of coffee, I buy a box of something different.  This is the first box I have actually thrown away. I would recommend just about any other coffee out there for the Keurig."
5,"I have tried many of the K-cup coffees. The Newman's extra bold is one of the best. Absolutely no bitterness. Strong, flavorful and mellow all the way. You will love it. (Unless you're a fan of weak coffee)."
5,"We've tried many of the brands & flavors out there for the Keurig System K-cups.  This is the one that we absolutely MUST keep on hand.  It's our favorite coffee to wake up with in the morning.  Tastes wonderful, full-bodied and strong enough without being bitter.  It does it for us!"
4,"I tried a sample at BJs, and really enjoyed it.  When I want something stonger and bolder than our usual selection, I grab a Newman's Special Blend."
5,"Great product, great taste, can't be beat EXCEPT THE PRICE: it was $10.00 cheaper today at Sam's Club, including tax. Enough said."
5,This one is my very favorite of all the coffees and believe me I have tried them all.  I also have most in case others want different.<br />I have ordered this brand a couple of times from Amazon and also from Costco.
5,Some of the Keurig coffees seem to have a slightly bitter aftertaste. This one does not. It's got good flavor and seems strong enough you can brew the large size cup without it getting watered down.
5,"Truly the best I've tried, and I've tried many!  If you like strong coffee but are turned off by a bitter aftertaste, try this coffee; it's strong, flavorful, smooth...  practically perfect.  I just love the smell of this as it brews!"
5,"I just recived the keurig for Christmas and already I am a huge fan of how easy it is to make a quick cup of coffee. I really love the extra bold as it has a very rich,yet smooth mild flavor all at the same time this is one of my favorites so far."
5,"When I want a treat that won't break the bank, this is it. Twenty-four mugs of perfect coffee delivered to my door."
5,This is my favorite coffee.  I use it when I really want to enjoy my coffee.
1,"Love these kcups. Box said ""80"" but contained only 35. Please send me the missing 45 kcups Newmans Own Special."
3,This is great coffee and I have been ordering it.  You can get a much better deal on this at Sam's Club.  $36 for 80 cups.
3,"I like my coffee strong, and Newman's Own Special Blend is that, however, I'm not crazy about the slight bitter taste. Smooth and strong would be better, so maybe next time I'll look for something along those lines...."
5,"I drink Newman's own every morning, it is such good coffee.  I also like that I can enjoy a good cup of coffee and at the same time contribute to charities that help children in need.  This is a win-win situation."
5,"Simply put....I love this coffee!!! It's my favorite!!! Hard to find sometimes, so I make sure I have extra on hand!!! It has a nice rich, bold taste! If you like the taste of coffee, you won't be disappointed!!!"
5,"I love good coffee and had tried several different k-cup flavors. They were okay but not great. Then I tried this one. Wow, rich, full bodied flavor that you can really savor and enjoy!"
4,Good flavor and bold accents.  Very good but just doesn't<br />Grab me. I tend to rprefer very bold and strong coffee.
5,"This is the best K-cup coffee that I have tried so far and I end up ordering this repeatedly. If you like smooth tasting, fairly-strong coffee, get this!"
5,"I shoula bought it at Costco for much less and next time I will.  Everything else, the product, the delivery, etc was top rated as usual."
4,"This is a bold tasting coffee ( I drink it black) so if you like a French roast you will like this one, and the price is right."
4,This is my everyday coffee choice...a good all around crowd pleaser.  Green mountain Sumatra would be my back-up-for-a-change-of-pace second choice...nice to have both on hand!
5,What can I say except the coffee is not too strong and not too weak. No Bitterness. Overall a pleasant indulgence. Strong enough to stand up to plain or flavored creamers. Have tried a wide variety of brands now and this is one of my favorites. Another favorite is Sumatran Reserve.
5,"Newmans own is the best coffee around for the price.  My keurig is breaking me because the cups are so expensive, newmans is as good as any coffee out there and the price is better than the rest."
5,Excellent coffee. Good flavor and the 80 count is the best value for you money. Definitely recommend it if you're not a fan of weak coffee
4,"A good strong coffee, just enough to get you moving and Organic, that is always a plus.  Also very good on ice."
5,This coffee is excellent! Strong enough without bitterness.  Cost at Sams here in Texas is 38.00 so it much cheaper
5,"Newman's is really the best, however, I buy the cheaper brand nowadays. But if I could afford it I would always purchase Newman's Own coffee."
5,"Robust flavor, perfect for that first cup in the morning, and rich enough flavor for a larger mug. My favorite coffee to start the day."
5,I received the coffee on time as promised.  Paul Newman's coffee is fantastic! It has a very rich and robust flavor. I will buy it from now on!
5,"This K-cup makes a nice rich cup of coffee. I never use it for my morning jolt, but it's quick, convenient and tasty for the third or fourth cup of the day."
5,I'm very picky when it comes to my coffee.  I like mine strong with a good flavor.  This has become my only coffee and I've tried plenty.
5,Great price and delicious coffee. Fits the needs of all our family members.  This is one of our family's favorite coffees.
5,This is really good coffee for that morning take-off or the afternoon booster.  This features a nice mellow but rich roasted coffee that is hard to beat.  This is one of our favorites around the office and our family enjoys it at home as well.  Recommended.  RJB.
5,I like strong coffee.  My husband doesn't.  I use this with 8 oz.  He uses it with 12oz.  We both like the taste.
5,Newmans makes really good coffee. This seems to be bold smooth but not overpowering. I would recommend anyone to at least try this. Seems like it is one of those coffees that is down the middle of the road.
4,I have been a fan of most of Newman's products.  This one I would consider average.  Maybe I was expecting too much from a medium roast.  It is worth a try and I would purchase again.  Then I'll rotate my daily ingestion with some other blends so as not to get bored.
4,"This is a great blend.  Smooth medium in strength, color and flavor.  Has a very nice flavor that isnt too strong or too weak.  Paul would be proud of this blend."
5,This is my favorite K-cup coffee.  It is very bold and work on any cup size.  We use about 3 K-cups each day so the 80 pack lasts for quite a while.
5,"Yummy!  Great ""everyday"" coffee.  Newman products in general are wonderful for you and the earth.  This k-cup and Jet Fuel k-cups are enough for me!"
5,I normally drink the donut shop k cup. I've tried pretty much every k cup that can be found in stores. My mom pretty much forced me to check this out and Im glad she did! The taste is strong but not bitter. This has become my go to k cup when I need a coffee pick me up in the morning.
5,Coffee is very good. We have ordered it a couple times already and enjoy the taste and ease of use with the K-Cups
5,this is by far the best coffee i have tried yet for my keurig and also one of the better prices.  thank you
5,"Newman's Own Special Blend is a wonderfully bold coffee with a very rich flavor. A rich coffee aroma proceeds the bold, full, lasting floavor and with no bitter or dry after taste. Great."
5,"We love the Newman's Special Blend roast from Green Mountain.  Not too bold, but very rich flavor.  Nice middle of the road roast.  Highly recommend it."
5,"this is hands down my favorite kcup option out there.  not too mild, not too bold, a nice solid body to this coffee.  cheaper here than you can find at the store, and has arrived without issue everytime i order another box."
5,This makes for a great cup of coffee!  It's the perferct brew strength for me and a nice flavor that has a little bite to it.
5,"Have tried may K-Cups this one is the best. It is a strong brew, so if you prefer something more mild, this one might not be for you."
5,I have been a bit disappointed with the K-Cup coffees in general - just not strong enough or so strong they are bitter. Not this - I have found my coffee of choice
5,"Great taste, best price around. Fast delivery-will order on continuing basis. Read reviews where people thought this was bitter....I don't get it - they must like brown water not coffee."
5,I can't have caffine and this is a great alternative for me.  Great price here on Amazon compared to shopping locally.
5,"Yogi Teas are the highest quality--organic, earth-friendly, and flavorful. I prefer them to any other brand. The calming tea is slightly spicy and relaxing; the packaging is good for the environment. I love reading the exercises and philosophical messages on the box. Yogi Tea is the bomb!"
5,This is one tea that actually works to relax and ease tensions. I am an insomniac and can be awake until...but this helps me to drift off into a decent sleep.
5,"Excellent tea for the money. Love the taste and it's all organic. Makes excellent ice tea as well. Try their other flavors too, they are just as good."
5,I have been drinking this tea for several years. It is great when you feel Stressed. Within a few hours of drinking it makes me feel in a relaxed and peaceful state of mind. I highly recommend this tea.
5,I really like the flavor of the Calming Tea. It has a hint of sweetness and it's very mild. I didn't like the Bedtime tea. It has a heavy flavor of licorice and I didn't like it.
5,Calms VERY WELL.  Tastes great with honey but that's a personal choice.  Best stuff!  Can't wait to try their other teas!
2,I bought this tea at Stop and Shop and it clearly has warnings on it but I didn't expect it to cause like a panic attack or something uncomfortable like my heart to beat loudly as it was audible. I don't fancy the flavor of this tea.  Yogi makes a sampler with this one in it.
5,"It is the best hot chocolate I have ever tasted, the cinnamon is what makes it good"
5,"When it came to hot chocolate my beverage used to be swiss miss.  But after one cold morning of moving a hot tub I was rewarded with Abuelita.  This hot cocoa has tastes of cinnamon and other spices.  I like to add a bit of cayenne or chili powder to it, and it is just delicious."
1,I found this product disappointing. It did not dissolve quickly and left a gritty residue. It is very high in sugar - almost 70 grams per tab and has saturated fat listed as one of the ingredients.
5,"This is NOT hot chocolate in the classic sense. This is a hot, chocolate beverage not to be wasted on young children or adults lacking taste buds. You have to be someone that really ENJOYS flavors, textures, etc. to get the difference or you might as well stir up some swiss miss."
5,"I have been making hot chocolate w Abuelita for years. I have found that if I heat a tablet(in its paper) in the microwave, i can spoon in a softer mostly melted mix that does not require a blender or diminish the flavor. You may want to start at about 30 secs and warm more as needed."
1,"I got this a few months ago with high hopes but it was barely OK, kind of grainy, did not dissolve in milk."
1,"Sorry to all you champurrado fans, this is not the real deal, but an artificial version, and WAY too sweet. Please compare to others 'hecho en Mexico', and get yourself a 'molinillo' while you're at it! ps: I use almond milk to make mine!"
3,I bought this one for the picture on the front. I thought it might reinforce my threats to send my naughty children to grammas if they don't behave.
5,"WHY DO THEY ALWAYS PUT SOMETHING ON THE MARKET, TEASE YOU FOR A COUPLE OF MONTHS<br />AND POOF ITS GONE. THIS IS THE BEST TASTING PRODUCT FOR PEPSI."
5,"Sierra Mist Diet Cranberry Splash is the best tasting soda to be released.  I've enjoyed it for several weeks now, but can't find it anywhere in the St. Louis market presently."
4,"I have used this seasoning in chicken soup for several years and it adds just the right bit<br />of flavor to the soup.  No other brand works as well.  It is OK on baked chicken, etc but<br />try it in soup and I am sure you will agree"
5,"This extract is excellent, and it shipped really fast.  It's great in blueberry muffins, and works well as a fragrance.  I would also recommend it rather than tasty puff for a delicate flavour in your tobacco."
5,"The lavender flavor is not found everywhere, and works well in tea or coffee.<br />I like to add true vanilla extract as a base flavor."
5,i love the taste of lavender but if you use to much it can be soapy tasting and thats just really bad..
5,"This is a nice ground coffee and the price is very reasonable.  The grind is finer than what is normal for auto-drip makers, which is good because I can use less so it goes much further, making it even more economical.  I have purchased it on more than one occasion and would definitely buy again."
5,Great for people with asthma! I like the taste and best of all the results. Being able to breathe freely...<br />Releives the congested feeling better than my inhaler.<br />Although you should let the tea steep for the recommended 10 to 15 minutes.<br /><br />Yogi Teas Breathe Deep Tea 16 Bags
5,This is the best this that i have ever used for my Bronchitis and the other breathing problems that me daughter and I have.  I highly reccommend this.
5,Good price when you order 12 boxes.  Came on time.  I like this when I have chest congestion.
5,"I don't even really like tea much but this tea is amazing. I love it. Flavorful and even therapeutic, it's a tea I crave during colder months & am bummed when I run out."
5,"This is a VERY good tasting tea and has helped me more than once with that ""heavy"" feeling of congestion.  It's one of many herbals that I keep in our home."
5,"I've used this product for years, and find it helpful for mild breathing problems."
5,This tea is fantastic.  The main flavor is licorice - with other herbal undertones and it is my favorite tea of all.  I had to buy the six pack because I run through a single pack so fast.
4,"With that said, it is a tasty combination of herbs that will open up your lungs a bit. It tastes minty/sweet which is soothing, but theres no tea. Check the ingredients."
5,This mix is so good and so versatile that you can make multiple types of drinks.  It is great replacing the water with ice cubes and blending.  The frozen drinks this make is fantastic.  I would never use anything else
5,"Man... this stuff is excellent,but for some reason it has increased in price by 50%!! what the h*** is up with that?I used to buy it right from the manufacturer,but found it on Amazon even cheaper..but now Amazon's price is even higher!Guess I'll go back to drinking beer."
5,I ordered Bartenders Whiskey Sour Mix about 6 months ago for $26.00. I see it's now $39.00! WT----! Are you out of your mind? Could you reply or is it going to cost me?
4,"This bone is very good for a large dog. My rottie/mastiff loves them.<br /><br />But be careful the Amazon web page says ""pack of 5"" for 5.99 or 6.99 per bone and I had an order screwed up and they sent me one bone which is in no way near cost effective. Either buy five bones or none at all!!"
5,"My mini schnauzer loves her G.I Bone 3"". It is just the right size to put in her mouth without worrying about choking. She was able to get the filler out within 3 minutes. The bone has lasted several months. Also, this bone does not splinter."
5,dogs thought these were quite a treat. and having to very large dogs I was pleased by how long they lasted.
4,"My dogs are bone lovers.  These are a little messy but my dogs love them.  Very good choice for the avid bone chewer.  To insure freshness, I did freeze the unused bones for future use."
5,"I wrote to Oskri asking if the soy lechitin was organic, or at least non-gmo, and they replied saying ""Our Mini Coconut Milk Chocolate bars are certified organic"" - They even sent me the ""MOSA Organic Certificate"" to prove it.  So enjoy knowing they're organic!"
5,"Everyone I've given these to enjoys these very much.  I prefer the dark chocolate ones myself, but I made a mistake and ordered the milk chocolate.<br /><br />I cannot eat them as I am allergic to milk, but my husband, guests, and co-workers are enjoying these healthy alternatives to candy bars."
5,Its delicious but not too sweet . Its double delight the coconut with milk chocolate its a treat. My friends love the taste.
5,These little coconut bars are the perfect size.  We needed a gluten free snack that would be a good treat and this is it for us!
5,"These are a great mini snack and treat, really it reminds me of a better tasting and healthier mounds bar without the almond.<br /><br />Gluten free as well"
5,If you love coconut you will love these!  I eat too many at a time is the only problem with this product!  Enjoy!
5,"I just love this product, have ordered many times.<br /><br />Thank you,<br /><br />Darell White"
5,"We feed Solid Gold food, to our dog, on a rotating basis.  For SOME dumb reason, our local pet store doesn't carry the Sun Dancer.  SO, we were glad to find it on Amazon.  We think the Solid Gold company makes one of the best dog foods on the market, today.  Oh, yes.. dog loves it, too."
5,More energy and feel better since I started using this product.  I am not a big breakfast person so this fills in nicely as a quick and nutritional way to get going in the morning.
4,What better way to tell your mom you love her by reminding her of her age? This bundle comes with most of the candies from a decade long past. The amount of candy is generous and fun and fairly priced. Bring back old memories with this fun gift.
5,You can buy this at the pet store for about 2.19 a can . on the web here this is a rip. Sorry
5,"I have used Breeders Choice, Avoderm for many years with excellent results,i.e. shiney coat,no digestion problems ect. It's all natural and low protein for large breeds like the Bernese Mountain Dog. Its pricey<br />though."
2,This coffee was extremely weak and did not taste well. I do not recommend wasting your money on it.
5,"We cannot get enough of Little Duck Organic Snacks. Our little one loves the blueberry. We love the fact that they are totally healthy for baby, and are a fun treat to sneak in a serving of fruit. Not only does baby love them, but mommy sneaks one in every now and again also. Great Product!!"
5,Purchased these for my neice and she loves them four big thumbs and two little ones up and a big ol' smile of approval. These are a great treat for any child (even the picky ones)
5,"Not only are they organic, but they are the perfect snack for little ones! My 17-month old loves these, especially the blueberries which are SOOOOOO good for you---he doesn't like fresh ones, but freeze-dried ones are great!!! We LOVE Little Duck Organics."
5,"My son and I love these. They are so good. My toddler loves to snack so I am always trying to find healthy snacks for him to eat. He loves them. They are great for on the go eating too. Try them, you wont be disappointed."
5,"Of course taste is always subjective, but I have a really touchy stomach and Ginger Altoids nearly never fail to alleviate the queasiness. If you don't like strong, slightly burning tastes, stay away. If you do... you will love 'em!"
5,"I have done alot of research on dog food, and I would state this is one of the best out there. Have been feeding it to my dog for about a year now and best of all it is made right here in the U.S.A. :)"
5,This is my favorite Starbucks coffee...nice and mild and flavorful. I do not like heavy or darks roasts...this one hits the spot..
5,"Delicious Marzipan. Niederegger makes the best marzipan. The assortment is lovely and very tasty. Although the portions are small, they are dense with flavor and richness, and are quite satisfying."
5,Received the marzipan variety box promptly and in perfect condition. Candy was fresh and I hope I can make it last more than a few days.
5,"This is the best green tea I have ever tried. It is subtle, yet has a nice aftertaste that is both refreshing and relaxing"
5,"The tea is absolutely delicious. It's a bit expensive, but if you like tea a lot then this is a very good purchase to make! It's my new favorite tea =)"
5,"I love this stuff, hot w/ touch of honey and milk.  Or chilled w/ ice and touch of honey too.  Lovely flavor to say the least.  I am a fan and am happy to find product.  I would certainly suggest product to my friends who like fine teas."
5,Love Harney & Sons teas and once again they exceeded my expectations with this deliciously sweet vanilla decaf tea! Love the tin also! High quality teas and so worth the splurge!
5,"This mild tea is great any time of day, however, it really hits the spot after dinner as a substitute for dessert.  It's light and has a warm vanilla taste.  What makes it even better is it's decaffeinated.  I like giving these pretty tins as hostess gifts."
4,This is awesome tea and I purchased it as a gift for my aunt who loves this flavor. The price is what you'd expect to pay at Whole Foods or any other specialty store.
3,"It smells good, tastes like black tea, and it is decaffeinated.  I didn't really taste the creamy sweet flavor of vanilla.  In other words, the tea tastes like normal black tea if not for the vanilla aroma.  I think I'll go back to green tea based tea."
5,The rice cakes were exactly the same I have been buying for years. What else can I say?  I could not have been more satisfied. I could not ask for any better.
5,"If you love the taste of caramel and the crisp crunch of a thin cookie that doesn't fill you up, there's no better alternative. I can eat this all day!"
1,the product was very good. why i gave it 1 star was the poor packaging and all the broken cookies.
1,"After confirming that the receipt of ONE BAG was not an error, I was able to get a partial credit."
2,"My baby likes it but I think it's too much sugar. It's made from concentrate, so it tastes artificial. Try fruitables instead. It has vegetable and fruit juices, less sugar, and tastes much better. Good price on Amazon."
4,"This Celtic Sea Salt is delicious!  Recommended by our acupuncturist, we knew it was better than table salt.  It really wakes up our food flavor and we know we are getting the minerals our bodies need.  I would recommend this to anyone who is concerned about too much salt intake."
5,I have tried several dried apple brands available in bulk online and at warehouse stores and so far these are the best.  I prefer slightly soft dried apples.  Other brands have been too crunchy or filled with sulfide preservatives.
5,"Buy it now, please. These are just great, with perfect flavor and texture. I keep them in the refer where they are even more refreshing. Try them with different things: in salads, with crudite, with good dark chocolate, with your tea in the morning, as we do. A+++"
5,I was very pleased with Cool Capp Double Mocha Iced Coffee Mix. I felt it tasted like the iced coffee I get at Gloria Jeans when I am at the mall.  I also like the Big Train Iced Coffee mixes.  I have saved so much money making my own iced coffee at home.
4,These wafers very good and tasty. But where is expiration date on the packaging?! Why a manufacturer does not consider it necessary to specify it? Why only lot number?
5,This stuff is amazing-it not only tastes exactly like sugar it looks like sugar. This is the only substitute sugar my husband has not detected. We have had it in our sugar bowl for five months and he still thinks it is sugar!
4,"Good substitute for sugar, I like it much better than stevia, which to me has an awful after-taste.<br />I did notice though that the Erythritol isn't quite as sweet as sugar which can make it just a little expensive."
5,Erythritol leaves NO aftertaste in my muffins or pies.  I've tried other sugar-substitues but nothing beats Erythritol.  Everyone who tastes items baked with this sweetener wants to know what I used.
3,"Not a very cost effective sweetener, takes too much to do the job.  I believe that truvia (a combination of erythritol and stevia extract) is much more likable and costs less to use.  We didn't mind the taste as some others did, but were glad we only bought one pound."
5,I HATE ALL FORMS OF DIET SUGARS!<br />THEY ALL HAVE AN AWFUL CHEMICAL TASTE WHICH IS ALWAYS TOO SWEET<br />i FOUND THIS ERYTHRITOL I WAS SOOO HAPPY TO HAVE SOMETHING THAT TASTED GOOD IN BOTH TEA AND COFFEE WITH NONE OF THE GUILT OF REGULAR SUGAR!<br />TRY IT I THINK YOU WILL LOVE IT!
5,I am on a diet were I can't use sugar; but i like sugar in my tea it takes a little more than sugar to sweeten it but i can say i now can enjoy my tea again..
3,"It's a decent product if you can't handle/tollerate Xylitol and some of the side effects people experience. Erythritol, IMO, is not as sweet as Xylitol and is more expensive. I gave it a try, but will stick with my first choice."
5,"its a good sweetner i mixed it with one pound of stevia, half an half works good. alot cheaper, real good deal, thank you<br /><br />  larry"
5,This product is easy to use for all baking and it tastes just like sugar!
3,"This product is not very sweet.  I also use Agava nectar and find that sweeter.  I was looking for something to take the place of granular sugar.  Don't think this is it right now.  I'll stick with the agava nectar.  Trying to get away from nutra sweet, sweetn low and splenda."
3,"The product is advertised as ""100 Pure Erythritol Crystalline Powder.""  The emphasis should be on the crystalline, not the powder; the texture is like granulated sugar, not powdered sugar, and this can make a difference when cooking."
5,"Although it has less sweetness than sugar, erythritol is far superior to Splenda and all the sugar alcohols (xylitol, maltitol, etc). It has no weird aftertaste, doesn't give a headache or gastric upset. Shipping was quick from Amazon and the product is maybe even better than I expected."
2,"I bought this expecting the ""powdered"" form as it specified and ended up paying for a product I cannot use. The two, granulated(which this IS) and powdered(which it clearly is NOT) are NOT interchangeable within recipes. I felt like I was tricked into buying the wrong product!"
5,"Super fast delivery, fantastic product but it is granulated not in powder form as described. Blending it  dry for few minutes will pulverize it and  make it much more soluble when baking with."
5,"This sweetener is quite good. Pricier than traditional sugar and substitutes, but given it's extremely low glycemic index and lack of aftertaste it is well worth it!"
5,this is the first time i have used this product; it was delicious kids loved it & kept its flavor after baking.  came fast  thanks
5,I have ordered these for several years for my husband as a special Christmas gift and they are wonderful. He looks forward to getting them every year. Fruit is plump and moist and chocolate is delicious.
4,"these almost disappeared before i had a chance to get a taste! Everyone loved, even teens visiting who don't eat a gluten free diet...teen age son asked ""are these really gluten free, they're good!"""
5,These brownies were easy to make and tasted great!  It's hard to tell they are gluten-free because they don't taste like it.  And I've never seen them offered so cheap as on Amazon.  I highly recommend them.
5,This mix is easy to make and tastes delicious.  It is moist and chewy.  It satisfies those that eat gluten as well!  My second favorite brownie mix is by Authentic Foods and all the others I have tried and would not make again - they went in the trash can.
5,My daughter is a celiac and cannot have any gluten.  This is an easy to use mix that taste great!  Especially warm with a scoop of ice cream on top!
5,"I picked these up because my wife is trying (sort of) to eat gluten-free.  She loves these brownies, and I have to admit that they are pretty good.  Maybe not quite as good as ""real"" brownies, but still pretty good."
5,"A friend recently got me hooked on these gummy frogs. I was curious about the flavor so I e-mailed Haribo directly! They did reply... The green gummy is apple, and the white marshmallow is passion fruit. The price here is great too!"
5,"The top of the frogs have a slight lime taste and are like big gummi bears. The white bottom is a foamy sugar similar to marshmallow. The combination has a nice feel to it when you're eating them. They're also great for sticking to your friend's forehead, just lick the frog's white belly."
5,"I buy these for my husband every year for Valentine's day... you would think that they could last for a long time, but usually by the end of March he's finished the entire bag!!! I'm not big on gummies, but I have to admit they are delicious! :)"
5,"These were great, they were not hard like some bulk candy and quite enjoyable, my whole family is enjoying these cute little frogs"
5,these are the best things in the world.  my family and i love love love them.
4,"I'm not sure what Paul J. Carlson ""Dilettante"" received, but the candies I received were soft, had a pleasant, mild taste of apple and definitely looked like a frog you'd see sitting on in/by a pond.<br /><br />No complaints here."
5,"I have these on Subscribe & Save and they do not come often enough.  I ate these when I was a kid living in Germany and they are still as good as I remember them being.  I have ordered several bags and they have always been consistently good, I have never received a mediocre product."
5,Our family loves these gummy frogs! They are so fresh and soft when you open the bag. They don't even have time to go stale...we finish them off long before then. And the price is fabulous! We have automatic delivery every 2 months (though my kids wish it was more often). Highly recommended!
5,"I ordered this HUGE bag of gummy frogs for the little man's birthday party as they fit my theme.  Tons of compliments on them, and very reasonably priced (compared to shopping locally, which I really do try to do).  No one believed these were an Amazon.com purchase, they were so fresh and tasty!"
4,great value and haven't gone bad after sitting in a sealed jar for over a month.<br /><br />great snack and are fine in a ziplock
5,"I was worried after reading reviews that these would come to me stale. Fortunately, that wasn't the case. These arrived fresh and very tasty."
5,"Seriously the best candy ever!  And to make it even better, now you can get them in a 5 lb. bag!!  Gave the huge head sized bag to my wife as a stocking stuffer for Christmas.  ""Best gift ever!"" was her response."
2,"While these were so cute to look at, when I tasted them and had other people give them a try, the overwhelming response was YUK."
5,"My whole family enjoys these tasty little candies.  I'm not sure how to describe the flavor, but it is really addictive.  These are my favorite of the Haribo candies that I've tried.  Purchasing the five-pound bag is a big saving over individual bags."
5,Used these for a frog themed baby shower and they were a big hit.  Tasted great and arrived fresh.
5,I LOVE MY FROG GUMMY CANDY...I even shared it with the grand kids (even though I DON'T normally share with anyone).
5,"I can't find these tasty green apple frogs very often, but now I can just order them from Amazon.  I love these - no fat and real taste!"
5,most awesome addictive candy i have had in a long time.you will wish you never tried them!
5,"Once again a winner! These Haribo Frogs are my favorite! The large bag is a little harder because toward the end the frogs started getting a little tough. But, I solved that by re-bagging them all myself as soon as I opened the next one. Delicious!"
5,my son thought it was awesome but i think it was okay .. but i would definitely order again since my son really love it
5,1 tea bag good for 32 oz pitcher. Great fruity clean taste. I love all of the Mighty Leaf Teas. The silk tea bags are so much nicer then the regular tea bags. Pricey but worth it.
5,"I love Cafe Francais. I was very excited to find it on Amazon for such a great price compared to store pricing. Also, quite often it is not in stock. Cafe Francais is the only flavor I choose to drink as all others are too sweet or not to my taste."
4,"The coffee is great, no complaints.  However, contrary to reviews about the price, the Target store I shop at sells these everyday for 3.29 and sometimes less when they are on sale.  Do the math."
5,"Love this selection of the International Coffee's most of all. Delicious, invigorating, makes you want to have another cup right away."
5,I had garlic prawns for lunch and had to go to a meeting afterwards. My girlfriend offered me some Eatwhatever and I have been hooked ever since. This stuff is amazing. Completely gets rid of that really smelly breath that even brushing your teeth can't fix. I am now addicted.
3,It is OK.  No need to spend money on expensive mints!  It is better to brush one's teeth or chew a Big Red Cinnamon gum.
4,"Cant tell if product works. Mint that you ""suck"" last about 30 seconds. Its inconclusive for me in the way of a review."
5,"All natural and taste delicious. Great snack food or add to a dish.Taste great in wild rice, salads, yogurt."
5,"Absolutely delicious.  Exactly as advertised.  Comes in sturdy, resealable bags.  Last a long time in your pantry."
1,This was my own fault for not reading the small print but just to save someone else my fate - these are the smallest of boxes not the movie-size boxes! I can get this product in the movie-size for $1.00 locally. This small box cost me almost doouble that. Lesson learned.
5,During the time I lived in England I became aware of this product and was pleasantly surprised when I found it on Amazon. I continue to purchase and consume Ribena when a fresh light refreshing drink is needed after a hard day at the office.
5,"I could eat it with a spoon, it's so good.<br /><br />Being partial to hazel nut chocolates. I love this delicious spread on toast.I put it on a bun and it's just like a pastry and a more natural one , free of chemicals.<br /><br />Highly recommended, you'll love it if you haven't tied it yet."
5,it is an excellent spread.  nutella and peanut butter sandwiches rule.
5,"This stuff is literally the reason I am overweight! It is so incredibly delicious I cannot even begin to describe it.<br /><br />Try it, you will not regret it!"
5,This is a really good spread! The blended nutty flavor really hits the spot. I don't just spread it on my slices of bread but made cake rolls with it! making it tasted yummier!
5,...not something you want to eat every day unless you have a robust metabolism (low-cal this stuff is NOT!) but if you allow yourself an occasional splurge this is just AWESOME.  I can't believe I never tried it until now.
5,"I bought this to send to my boyfriend, who loves Nutella, and will eat it with pretty much anything, including garlic bread, no joke. He claims that it is good.<br /><br />Apparently, this is a monstrous size. I'm sure he's almost done with it by now."
4,"I have tasted the succulent product of Nutella for the first time in my life. I would say that the consistency, balance of sugary content, and flavor are quite exceptional.<br /><br />(Would rate 9/10 if it were an option)<br />Would consume again."
5,Perfect for crepes! It's not a peanut butter taste- it's actually hazelnut which is more delicious. We put on bread for breakfast.
5,"Having never had Nutella, the scandal over its advertising made me curious, so I went ahead and bought a sample size. It has a unique taste and it is very good. I'm going to now buy a full size and put it on my morning wheat toast. So take that you haters !"
5,"My daughter loves this. This goes very well with bread, crepe or any sort of breakfast items. It is buttery smooth, and has a rich chocolate flavor. Be warned - It is addictive."
5,"Love the product, but it came in a container that read ""...part of a multipack; not to be sold separetely,"" and the inside seal didn't seem sealed when I opened the lid (came off very easily, when I opened for the first time).  But product is apparently perfectly fine.  Dangerously delicious :)"
5,I eat Nutella almost every morning. I love and my kids love it. It seems to go well with most things. YUMMY!
5,"It was a smooth transaction. Easy ordering, fast delivery, yummy breakfast birthday biscuits!! YaY! I will be ordering another jar very very soon."
5,"Received this purchased boxed of 5lbs of candy within just a few days or ordering it on-line.<br />The price was exceptional compared to THE VERMONT STORE.<br />They had the very same candy, but, sold for much more and it was just 2.5lbs NOT 5lbs."
5,"Thank You for all the info on the product.I was looking all over the place trying to find a place that had Blackberry Sangria, Amazon was the only one who carried it. It makes a great drink Thanks again."
5,Used this to make blackberry sangria that taste exactly like Carrabba's served. Absolutely delicious. All my girlfriends love it. Great for tailgating. Nice because the recipe is on the bottle for a pitcher or just a glass.
5,"This is one of our favorite weeknight meals.  It is so simple to prepare, you can throw all ingredients in one pot (I don't like doing dishes), and most importantly, it's delicious and makes a healthy meal."
5,I find a cup of the Colombia coffee to be very distinctive and full bodied. This blend is one of my favorites from Community Coffee with its fresh aroma spreading around my home in the morning.
1,"Like the other reviewer said, this pepper doesn't have much kick - if any at all.  I had a feeling something may have been off - or in this case, nonexistent - and that certainly is the heat.<br /><br />Don't waste your money on this stuff!"
4,"Was well worth the money but was super cheap, it arrived super fast and the quality of the flakes is the same as if I went to the grocery store. I would definitely recommend it"
5,"i am a hot chocolate addict, and this is the best one I have come across. It has a rich flavor with a hint of spices in it. It's really great."
2,"There is way to much surgar in this hot chocolate it's like having sugar flavored chocolate, I am going to have to buy some pure powedered chocolate and mix it in the bag, other then that I would say it would taste good if it was not so sweet."
5,I first tried this product after visiting the Chocolate exhibit in Chicago six years ago and it reminded me of a tasty coffee I had in Canc&uacute;n in the late 1990s.  It makes a great cup of hot chocolate and I occasionally enjoy mixing some with coffee to make a mocha.
5,"This is a great treat for the Fall and Winter months hunting, camping or just snuggling up to watch a movie. The cinnamon is not too overpowering with the chocolate and has a rich cocoa flavor. My wife drinks it as an alternative to coffee so she can sleep at night."
5,"Ok it makes a Great Cup o' Chocolate! But I really use it in my baking of Brownier, Cookies, etc. Such a good addition to any scratch baking project."
5,This makes an excellent hot chocolate.  I also make my own gourmet hot chocolate mix and I use a bit of this to kick up some of the mix.
5,"Tried this while I was visiting in PA. All natural ingredients, while the flavor is exceptional!  Try this one, you'll never drink any other!"
2,"Unfortunately, I was disappointed with this chocolate--too heavily spiced and too sweet; not enough of that velvety, smooth pure chocolate that I prefer. I have 4 tins that I will give away to friends and family.  I'll be back and will let you know how they like it."
5,"A wonderful taste surprise that has spoiled me for all other hot chocolate drinks there ever were.<br />MOCAFE Azteca D'oro 1519 Mexican Spiced Ground Chocolate is a rich, creamy, spice surprise that is not your mama's hot chocolate. If you are a hot chocolate drinker don't miss this."
5,"I purchased this product because of the reviews I read and I'm so glad I did.  I love it.  If your looking for a good hot chocolate this is it.  Sweet, spicy chocolate...very good."
5,This is the best drinking chocolate I have had on the market.  The spices are perfectly combined for an authentic Mexican taste. The seller delivered 100% as promised.<br />Thank you.
5,"I've been using the MOCAFE Azteca for years.  Sweet and a bit of spice.  Mixes easily.  And you can get by with half the suggested amount.  Nothing warms you up faster on a cold, winter day."
5,"i love this spicy chocolate. it's perfect for anytime. the best way to make it, is to heat your milk on the stove and add the chocolate as it is warming. i also add some whipped cream to my cup with a sprinkle of chili powder on the top. love to curl up and just relax with a warm cup."
5,"This stuff is good!!  That's all I have to say.  Rich chocolate, sweet but not overpowering, with a taste of cinnamon and almonds.  Great combination."
3,This is the 3rd brand of Mexican Spiced hot cocoa that I've ordered.  This by far is the poorest in tasting.  The other 2 were far superior in flavor.
5,"...but you'd better like sweet. This is not for those who want dark or semi-sweet chocolate. For those of us who like sweet, this is decadent . It is worth the $! Go for it!!!"
5,this is the best mix i have found.  i have been buying it for the last four years and plan on buying it as long as it is for sale.
5,I had 6 sample packets 1.25 oz. My oldest daughter 12 yrs loved it with whole or 2% milk. Have used some mixed with my morning coffee. Best Hot Cocoa mix I've tried.
5,So chocolaty and spiced just right! I decided to try this brand after reading all the wonderful reviews. I'd never had spiced hot chocolate before - just the plain store-bought instant kind. WOW! The flavor of this just blew me away! Best cup of hot chocolate I've ever tasted!! I'm hooked!!
5,First found this hot chocolate on the Museum of Natural History of all places. There's a great blend of sweetness and spice. It's so yummy!
5,I really like to put this on top of the coffee before brewing.  Yummy!
5,This is a fabulous drink that our entire family enjoys ! It has just the right combination of spices and chocolate.
5,This is the best spiced cocoa I've ever used. I love to put it in my coffee every morning!
5,This hot mexican spiced ground chocolate is a great defroster for the winter blast weather.  I love sipping this hot chocolate while watching the snow flakes falling.
5,"I first got this in Ridgeway, CO., driving 40 minutes each way to get a mocha made with this<br />mix. Then the woman who was making my coffee during my stay let me know it was just a<br />mix. I couldn't believe it, but it's true, a very delicious mix you can do right at home."
1,"I love hot chocolate, but I found this mix repulsive. There wasn't a strong chocolate flavor and the other flavor notes where far too sweet.  I had to throw it away. I will never purchase this again."
4,I rather enjoy mexican hot chocolate and am used to getting the thicker ground Ibarra style version.  The ingredients are quality and it makes a good drink appreciated by guests but unfortunately is not exactly what I wanted.
5,"I found this product in a coffee shop in Chincoteague, VA  And was blown away by it's taste.  Energizing, but not too over the top.  And I received it quickly."
4,I could eat this right out of the jar.  I am using it to replace the natural oily peanut butter I use in my smoothies.  It is alot less messy and tastes delicious.  Even my husband is surprised. Luv it!
5,I have been buying PB2 by the case!  My family has decided to lose weight and NOT give up peanut butter.  This product is all natural and DELICIOUS!
5,"This is the best peanut butter substitute I have ever had, and the chocolate version is perfect for low calorie desserts :o)"
5,I love this stuff!  I put it in a chocolate protein mix and voila! Chocolate peanut butter shake!  I also is great with a banana thrown in.
5,"Pb2 is really good, true peanut taste without the fat and calories.  My husband who is pb obsessive, even had to admit it was very good.  I will definately buy again."
5,This tastes better than peanut better. It is healthier. It is so much EASIER and CLEANER to handle. I will purchase this from now on.
5,"Excellent product! I use it to make smoothies & peanut sauce for my Asian inspired dishes! I highly recommend this as a healthy alternative to regular peanut butter. The only downfall, it's a bit pricey. However, well worth it."
5,I have always wanted peanut butter to have alot less calories. I LOVE peanut butter and this tastes GREAT and I'm helping my weight loss at the same time. I  think this is super and anyone wanting to try this you should.
5,"I use PB2 as an additive to morning shakes.  Specifically, I used it with Shakeology, but it would work with any protein powder on the market.  It's powdered peanut butter.  It's GREAT on ice cream and even good to have on a teaspoon."
5,This is really hard to get to the right consistency for use as a spread. But for cooking! WOW! Thai peanut sauce with a fraction of the fat and calories! I don't really bake but I could see a lot of uses there. Tastes just like roasted peanuts. Will buy again.
5,"Always looking for ways to cut fat & calories. This does that and kept the original flavor. Grandchildren, loved it too."
5,Tastes exactly like regular fatty creamy peanut butter!!! You would never guess its powder!  All the flavor and barely any calories!! I LOVE IT!!!!
5,This is really good. I am on weight watchers and I can have 2 tablespoons for only 1 point vs 5 points of regular peanut butter. I saw this on Dr. Oz's show and ordered it that day.
5,"The product itself was delicious, I could have done a little better by shopping around prices but overall happy w purchase."
4,"I was concerned that this would be pasty tasting, but it really good & mixes up well---great for camping. The kids like it."
3,"I found the taste to be satisfactory, especially for the reduction in calories.  I didn't mix it right the first time I had to end up making double, which I ate of course.  Ultimately, I decided that I really like crunchy peanut butter the best.  However, my belly will welcome the PB2 just fine."
5,"It really does taste good!  I don't like to measure anything... So if you put in too much water, you can just add more peanut powder to make it thicker.  Though, if you don't like the creamy kind of peanut butter and only like the chunky kind, this might not be for you."
4,Used this product for baking. Finally could make great tasting peanut butter recipes with out all the fat & calories.
5,i LOVE peanut butter but my waistline does not ; )<br />when i heard about this i ordered a bunch immediately.  it is really good and i don't think i'll go back to regular pb ever!!  will be buying again and again
5,I love the product. It really taste awesome on toast. I am thrilled it is all natural. I brought some to school and had all the teachers try this for lunch in the teachers room. It was a huge hit.
4,I was skeptical but this product is all its cracked up to be. Tastes great and works well in use.<br /><br />I have it four stars because 8 bucks for 6.5 ounces is expensive
5,"If you love peanut butter but hate the fat and sugar, then this product is for you. It is fantastic in smoothies and shakes--has a real peanut butter taste. At 45 calories a serving, I have it almost every day with my Shakeology! I will always keep this in the house."
5,My daughter loves this peanut butter.  It is low in fat and although it isn't exactly like peanut butter it is a great substitute.
5,"This product is awesome! I decided to buy from Amazon instead of the manufacturer because I wanted to try one jar before buying 4. It is a really good PB Substitute. It doesn't have the exact same texture as peanut butter, but it is almost like a whipped peanut butter. It is delicious!"
4,"I made peanut ""butter"" out of this flour and it was surprisingly good!  You need to put salt and/or sweetner on it, but that is to one's taste.  Personally, I like it just plain.  You can't beat the lower calories, lower fat, and price."
5,"I like to make a smoothie of this, a cup of cold brewed coffee, protein powder, a spoonful of Nesquik and lots of ice.  A banana too, if I'm feeling adventurous!"
5,"I am on Weight Watchers and I love peanut butter.  Now, I can have more of it without feeling guilty because there is virtually no fat in this product.  Tastes better than the regular stuff too.  Amazing!"
5,"PB2 is great. Not only is this peanut butter very low fat and low in calories, it tastes great. For folks who crave peanut butter but are trying to watch their weight, this is an awesome product."
5,I add this to cookies & cream whey protein or chocolate or with banana to vanilla whey and make a great tasting drinkable drink.  Only drawback is the price and availability at a store near where I live.
5,The taste is great and allows me to eat peanut butter even when dieting. Can get cheaper from PB2 website though.
5,This is the best price I've found for PB2 and it's eligible for free shipping and handling.<br />It tastes better than another powdered peanut butter product that I've tried.
5,"I really like this stuff.  I have been adding a tablespoon or two of this stuff to different stir-fry dishes, salad dressings, and to protein shakes.  It adds a very nice, fresh, peanut taste to anything and is better for you then regular peanut butter."
5,This peanut butter taste great! very easy to mix and has excellent consistency! I can eat peanut butter gult free with this product
5,"PB2 is the best diet ""friendly"" food I have ever ate. I am a true to my heart peanut butter nut to say the least. This tastes so great!!!"
4,"I don't think this tastes more than OK when you mix it with water to a paste, as the package suggests. But it is good for baking, in my oatmeal porridge and with cottage cheese and jam."
5,I've been eating better for a year and lost 70lbs.  I was looking for new ideas and found this.  I have used so far in my morning protein shake...just a 1/2 to 1 teaspoon is plenty.  Really great flavor.  I will buy this again.
5,"I was able to find this at my on base commissary for three dollars and eighty-nine cents, much cheaper than amazon is asking.<br /><br />We all love it, has a very natural roasted peanut taste to it and my kids love mixing it."
5,"This is the most wonderful thing for those of us who LOVE peanut butter, but are also watching our waistlines.  I think this tastes every bit as good as other peanut butters that are so much higher in fat and calories.  I'd recommend it to anyone!"
4,"I used this in homemade protein bars and it worked great. Good flavor, longer shelf life, and healthier than regular peanut butter. A nice addition to the cupboard."
5,"Can't go wrong with this product. I have no complaints. It helps with the peanut butter cravings perfectly. I can mix it into shakes, yogurt, whatever!"
1,"The product was expired for a year before I received it. It was unusable, and I had to throw it away."
5,This powdered peanut butter is yum.  I like to add it to my morning low fat/cal shake. I would definitely order again!
5,"Ran across PB2 while researching recipes for the new trend SMOOTHIES! Gives you that PB taste without the added fat, so you can add more ingredients. My favorite is PB2,frozen strawberries, almond milk and a lot of spinach!(can't even taste the spinach..but Oh so healthy!"
5,I am a peanut butter addict and I absolutely love using this in my daily protein shakes. Flavor is delicious and it is more than half the calories and fat. What more can you ask for?! Awesome healthier alternative. I have not tried it in a sandwhich yet though.
5,"I added this to my <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B005WLY4L8"">Sun Warrior Warrior Blend Raw Plant-Based Complete Protein Powder ~ Vanilla ~ 2.2 lbs Bag</a> protein shake, and it is amazing!  Has *almost* a Reeses Peanut Butter cup taste.  Highly recommended!"
5,"This product is perfect for shakes!! I drink it every morning. Sometimes when I crave something sweet I will make a shake with protein, almond milk and two big spoon fulls of PB2. I Love it."
5,I added two tablespoons of it to my chocolate protein and vanilla soy milk with a few slices of bananna.  It was delicious.  Tasted just like my smoothies with regular peanut butter. It cut out 160 calories and 14.8 grams of fat.
4,"This comes in powdered form that you mix with water to the consistancy that you like.  It is by far the best low cal/low fat peanut butter product.  I've tried them all, and although it's not as good as full fat/full cal peanut butter - it's pretty good."
5,Strange pricing on Amazon when you can get 4 for $15.96 at the company's site that makes this (Bell Plantation).
3,"Consider buying this from Bell Plantations it's much cheaper, about $3.99 a jar.  Amazon is riping people off with this product, shame on them!"
5,"FAN-TAS-TIC ON LIGHT ICE CREAM!!!!!!!!<br />TASTES JUST LIKE PEANUT BUTTER, NOW I CAN EAT MY ICE CREAM WITHOUT ADDING 32 GRAMS OF PEANUT BUTTER FAT!!!"
4,Adds a great low calorie peanut butter flavor to smoothies.  Mix with jam and a fabulous peanut butter sandwich.  So many options ... so little time
5,"This is great to add to shakes without adding too many calories and fat. Good flaver, tastes great and so easy to use!"
5,"Added 2 T spoons in my smoothie plus a frozen banana, it was great.  You can also add water or oil and make your own peanut butter.  Great on bread or crackers. Love peanut butter and by using this I miss alot of calories.<br />Plus this vendor was fast on delivery."
5,Excellent product. Tastes great even if you don't mix it with water. Great way to eat peanut butter. Price is really the biggest issue with the product.
5,I mix 2 tablespoons a day and smear it on rye toast!.....YUM....just like when I was a kid but this time without all the fat and calories!
5,This is the best product ever. I used to put regular peanut butter in my chocolate shakes and it would stick to the blender jar. Just add a tablespoon of this powder in the jar and blend away. It is fantastic.
5,I'm on Weight Watchers and saw this product being used in many diet recipes.  It is fabulous and only 2 WW points + per 2 T.  Frozen banana mashed with PB2 is like ice cream.  Can't wait to try more recipes!
3,"Not good on sandwiches or oatmeal. Good for cooling with.  Don't know if I would buy it again, bit it certainly was interesting."
4,"This powder is delicious. I use it in protein smoothies, protein bars, and sprinkled over fruit. Used as an ingredient, I find it much less messy than regular PB. My only complaint is that, if used in a recipe...the jar doesn't last as long as originally anticipated (due to the powdered nature)."
4,"I would say it doesn't taste 100% like regular peanut butter, but its definitely a great substitute! Can't wait to try it in recipes. I tried another reviewer's tip to add a little jelly for a classic PB&J spread - it was amazing!"
4,"Nothing beats real peanut butter's taste but this product is novel, adds peanutty taste to my smoothy and has far less fat and calories which is why I bought it. Very good. I'll buy more and would recommend it."
5,"This powdered peanut butter delivers the taste but not the calories.  With half the calories of regular peanut butter, indulgence is no longer a big deal.  Love this product."
4,I really enjoyed this peanut butter powder and need to buy some more as I am out.  I use it for my Herbalife shakes.
5,"So good! Purchased this because I love peanut butter but not the amount of calories in it. This is perfect to add to my smoothies, such an intense peanut butter flavor. I will defiantly order again, so yummy!"
5,"I first learned of PB2 from a Weight Watchers forum. Everyone was raving, so I thought I'd try it. I am so glad I did! While not as sweet or smooth as ""normal"" peanut butter, the essential flavor is there. I highly recommend PB2 to anyone ""on the fence"" about ordering it...you'll be glad you did!"
5,"This is an amazing product. PB2 tastes so good I didn't miss the fat. It is easy to mix. I used it blended into recipes and use it on toast or fruit.<br />A must in any healthy, dieters cupboard!"
5,Never expected powdered peanut butter to be this good.  My favorite thing to use it on is my vanilla ice cream.  It's only 1pp a serving on the Weight Watchers diet.  Great Product!
4,"Tastes like peanuts, but still lacks something with the fat removed.  Tastes like peanuts, but still lacks something with the fat removed."
5,Currently having trouble with the consistency its still runny but I am sure I will figure it out! Found some good recipes on pinterest
4,"The only problem with the product is the size for its cost, increase the size of the container.  It is great for shakes and protien mixes."
5,Love Love Love this stuff! Perfect in protein shakes! If you are in love with peanut butter but not the calories this is the product for you. I love to add a scoop in my protein shakes.  It makes the shake creamy and taste JUST LIKE a big scoop of peanut butter.
5,not much more to say after all these reviews....just throwing in my 2cents. It rocks....buy it. :) You won't be sorry.....and your dogs will love it too!!!!
5,"I really love this product!  It taste so good without all the fat and heart burn.  I like to mix it with strawberry jelly, equal parts and spread on my toast.  It has only 1.5 g of fat while peanut butter has 17g/ serving.  It is a guilty pleasure with little fat and calories."
4,I eat this daily. It isn't very sweet so I add a little Splenda when I mix it up. It tastes great on an english muffin.
5,"Great discovery!!  Super easy to mix up.  Tastes great as a good old peanut butter and jelly sandwich, with apples, celery, and crackers.  Highly recommended for those of you who want peanut butter minus the fat.  All the taste of regular peanut butter is there and the texture is very comparable."
5,I love this product. It is nice to get to enjoy all the great parts about peanut butter with none of the bad nutritional elements. I like to enjoy peanut butter but I don't want all the extra calories. Flavors are great.
5,I was excited to mix this right away.  Reviews are saying smoothies and such but there is no limit to what you can cook with this amazing powdered product.  I feel as though the home cook has just been given a token!  A secret ingredient in one's pantry.  Begin by adding it to indian dishes.
5,"PB2 is great.  A serving, 2 T of powder, is 1 point on Weight Watcher's Points Plus system.  Mixed with a tablespoon of water it makes something like peanut butter.  But even better is adding it to soups or smoothies for that peanut taste."
5,Product is awesome. This is an amazing alternatize to peanut butter and so much helthier. I am saving so many calories!
5,"My best friend introduced me to this product some time ago. I really love that I can sprinkle it on anything or even bake with it, sans all the guilt of regular PB. In fact, this is the only PB I can keep in my house!"
5,I've been hearing about this product on Hungry Girl.  I love peanut butter but not all that fat that goes along with it.  This stuff is amazing....so creamy and peanutty. I also like the portion control of just mixing the amount I need.  I gave one of the jars to my Mom and she loves it too.
4,Use this powdered peanut butter in smoothies.  Easy way to use for this purpose.  No messy clean up.  Saw the Hungry Girl use it and decided to give it a try.
5,I heard about this from a friend to help save points on Weight Watchers...I bought it and LOVE it. Really great taste and easy to make and take with you anywhere.
5,I love the product I use it over my Frozen Yocurt for a lower cal. desert.  Also have made chocolate candie with no cal. with some and cocoa  Very Yummy
5,"I was a bit skeptical about this powdered peanut butter. When I tried it I was pleasantly surprised by it! You mix 2T of powder with 1T of water to make a paste. The texture is about the same as the texture of a natural peanut butter, and the flavor is less fatty but with a stronger peanut flavor."
5,"Love this stuff, tastes 90% like real peanut butter , but with 25% of the fat and calories. I'm using in peanut butter and jelly, protein shakes , etc"
5,"low fat, low carb, low sugar, full taste! I love this product and recommend it to others on a healthy diet plan."
5,Gotta love the peanut butter with out all the calories and fat! Its perfect for use as peanut butter alone or in a healthy protein shake!
5,This is the first time I have ever written a review.  This stuff is AMAZING.  Truly! Try it.. you will LOVE it!
4,"I use this in my protein shake, with chocolate protein powder, almond milk, and SF banana syrup.  It helps keep the calories reasonable, with the protein and flavor high.  The first time I bought the small/regular size jar, and the next time the larger bag. I will keep buying this."
5,I mix this with water to make a peanut butter paste for morning toast when I am dieting.  It is great!!
5,"Great taste and excellent for mixing in with chocolate protein, shakeology etc. for a reese cup style shake. I will definitely buy again."
5,"Needed something to add to my protein shakes (vanilla) besides strawberries.  I have heard about this product but was hesitant on if it actually ""tastes"" like peanut butter.......UNBELIEVABLE taste!! Tastes EXACTLY like peanut butter!  Buy it.  You won't regret it."
4,The is a great product if you are on Weight Watchers.  Two tablespoons is only 1 point value.  Regular peanut butter is 5 points.  It still tastes exactly like the peanut butter you would buy in the store.
5,Just add water and Shazaam it's Peanut Butter = the stuff tastes great.  WOWZER ON A BANANA!  Peanut Butter without the fat  -  Who would have ever thought?
5,"This is by far the best choice for a low fat option for peanut butter. The idea of a powdered PB seems odd at first, but once reconstituted with water, it actually has creamy texture. Tastewise, I prefer this over any other natural PB on the market."
3,It's a good tasting peanut butter when mixed by a 1:1 ratio with water (sometimes added a bit of Truvia to make it sweeter) but didn't provide nearly as many servings as it says it will. i probably only got 9 out of it.
3,"The pricing is way off.  The description says that it is a savings over the $14.95 retail price, but that is the price of 4 jars at Bell Plantation's website, not just one like on Amazon.  I will be buying this somewhere else."
5,"i'm watching my calorie intake - and after reading all the reviews, i had to try this.<br />its truly amazing.<br />my favorite is to add 1 tbs. to about 1/2 cup vanilla fat free yogurt for breakfast. SO good!"
5,"I love PB2 - I add it to chocolate protein smoothies to make a Chocolate Peanut Butter treat, or I make it and eat it alone to feel like I'm getting true PB.  However, on the Bell Plantation site, the jars are only $3.99. Surely Amazon must have a misprint??"
3,"I was anxious to try this lower calorie version of one of my favorite foods. Overall, texture is fine, but taste is bland and seems to lack depth of real peanut butter. I would use this in recipes, but was sad to say it wasn't my favorite and I would eat regular peanut butter instead."
1,"I usually never give bad reviews to products but this is so bad. I have peanut butter daily, I love it so much. I got this to mix into smoothies but it is far too salty to use that way. It taste nothing like peanut butter. It is just gross."
1,"Just had this to make a PB&J and I was really just eating a jelly sandwich. I guess it would be ok to mix into a smoothie (maybe), but I didn't think it had any flavor at all."
1,"I'd heard how great this product was, but after trying it, I've found it is NASTY!! If you love peanut butter and I do, this is NO substitute. Yuck!"
5,"Wasn't sure if I would like this product but it's very good. Taste good, consistency is great. Very glad I tried it, I will order more."
5,"This product tastes just like regular peanut butter. It is great on protein shakes for an extra boost of protein. I highly recommend this product. It is, however, extremely overpriced on Amazon. Found this for 3.29 at a local store. Good luck!"
2,"I had heard quite a bit about the PB2, and being a lover of peanut butter, I thought I would try it. But, it just didn't do the trick. Taste was not what I like, though the consistency was OK. I prefer Better'n Peanut Butter."
1,"Unfortunately, most of the flavor in peanut butter is in the oil (fat).  Here they remove that and then tell you to put in water to replace it.<br /><br />You won't end up with peanut butter; you end up with thin, slightly peanut-flavored 'stuff'.  Buy it but don't expect anything else."
5,"Package with a reasonable size, great conditions, quick shipment. Package with a reasonable size, great conditions, quick shipment. Package with a reasonable size, great conditions, quick shipment."
2,This tasted so odd. All I can say is it tasted like aspartame. Gave me an awful headache. And the Chocolate was Worse! Dont waste your money.
1,Do not buy this if you think this will substitute your current uses of PB. I love PB found nothing this mixes with well or betters the taste. I Iove Amazon but ask these 5* ratings be investigated and following up that my review remains published.
1,someone gave me the jar of PB2.  I thought it was awful...yuck.  thank goodness I didn't actually pay money for it.  It was nasty!!
5,"Anyone who doesn't like this product is probably a fat slob. This is an amazing substitute for the extremely fat and calorie dense original. After trying this, I don't think I'll ever eat traditional peanut butter ever again!"
3,"This product really deserves 4 or 5 stars for the product itself.  However, as others have noted, Amazon has WAY overpriced it.  The manufacturer has its own website where it is much, much cheaper."
5,"I love PB2.  It mixes easily, and you can vary the consistency to your liking.  I liked mixing in extra water to make it like a pudding.  I bought a whole case, but the problem is that I liked it too much - I could eat a jar in about 3-4 days!"
5,"After reading the reviews (and trying the walden farms calorie free kind...gross!) I didn't have very high expectations for PB2. I was very happy to find that it was much better than I thought! I am a peanut butter addict, so it won't replace the good stuff... but it really is an awesome product."
5,"For those of us who need to watch their weight but who adore peanut butter, PB2 is a fantastic substitute for the real thing that allows for good taste and low calories, too. Way to go!"
5,"I am always looking to keep my calorie/protein/fat ratios within check to get the most nutritional bang for the buck. This is by far one of the top 5 finds for my smoothie arsenal. With 45 calories per 2tbsp, 5 g protein and 3g net carbs, 1.5g fat (no sat fat) ... This is a no brainer!"
4,This is available at nearly every gas station gift store throughout Georgia for $3.99.  I buy it at Plantation House gas station.  Plenty of others sell it too.
5,Fantastic.  I love the taste of peanut butter but not all of the fat and calories.  I can use this and have that great taste and not feel guilty.  I have recommended it to lots of folks.  Thanks..
5,"I use this PB in my oatmeal, on a pancake, on a sandwich, etc.  The taste is fantastic.  I will definitely be ordering more!"
2,"I did not think PB2 tasted like true peanut butter, then I figure out why, it has sugar added. I guess for people who like sugar added to peanut butter will like it, but I do not like it. I don't get it take out 85% of the fat and add sugar. Why?? Hopefully waiting for them to take out the sugar."
5,"This price is nearly 3 times more than any other site you can find it on.  5 stars is for the product, I would rate the seller at a price gouging 1 star."
5,"Add a few tablespoons to pancake batter with a few drops of banana extract and you have found manna from Heaven. If you're counting calories, dip apples in the PB2 - yummy! Add enough to taste for hot chocolate beverage. Elvis would have loved it!"
5,"After watching a lady who lost a great deal of weight demonstrate it on Dr. Oz, I decided to try it.  I have now ordered it a couple of times, because it replaces the peanut butter I love without the fat and calories.  I use it in shakes with greek yogurt and fruit all the time.  Love it."
4,I use this in my protein shakes all of the time! I didn't care for the taste eating it like real peanut butter but it is amazing in my shakes - I just bought the bigger size.  This jar is very small. I gave it 4 stars only because the jar is small for the price.
5,"I love this product. Packed with protein, low fat and great for us diet-ers, this product rocks.  The best thing? It can be used for camping, travel, emergencies (such as earthquakes, tornandos, etc.), and weight-watching ... I HIGHLY recommend this delicious product!"
3,"PB2 turned out to be a pretty good alternative to peanut butter. Although its definitely not as sweet it still tastes good on PB and jelly sandwiches and overall I thought it was pretty good. Its no Jiff, but if you are trying to cut back on calories it's a great substitute."
5,I like to mix it with muscle milk for an after workout recovery snack. Even just using water it comes out great but I like to use almond breeze vanilla for a better taste.
4,Just mixed this with water to create a paste to put on celery.  Very good substitute for regular peanut butter!  Love getting a nutty taste without all those fat calories!
5,"It arrived very fast.  And it is an awsome product, it goes well with anything I put it in!  I esspecially like it in coffee drinks.  Eating by the spoonful does require a little mixing cup, but I can make it think or runny and I like that."
5,This stuff is AMAZING!!!! Best thing ever! It tastes great and is very low calories and fat! I will continue to buy this stuff.
5,"I was very skeptical about trying this product, but it is delicious! Even when mixed properly, the texture is not quite like commercial peanut butter.  To me, however, the flavor is almost identical to natural peanut butter."
5,Tastes like real peanut butter - just make sure to use a little more water than what the directions say.  It's great if you're on WW!!!!!!  LOVE IT LOVE IT LOVE IT!!!!!
5,I am a Weight Watchers member and I love peanut butter.  This product allows me to enjoy one of my favorite flavors.  It is nutty marvelous on an apple.
5,I love this product.  It tastes just like peanut butter.  So easy to make.  Very low in calories and fat.  Definitely would buy again.
5,This is awesome stuff. I'm a weight watcher and this is an excellent subsitute for creamy peanut butter. You can do anything with it. It has an awesome fresh peanut taste. Makes a great apple dip and really good peanut smoothie without all the fat and calories. Will for sure buy again.
1,"Bought this under the influence of many positive reviews.  I'm sorry to say that I found this produce upalatable, unacceptable.  It manages to be both insipid and bitter, leaves a nasty aftertaste, and has none of the mouthfeel of peanut butter. I'm returning it right away."
5,Love this stuff.... i use it for my afternoon snack .. on a slice of ezekial sprouted grain bread and sliced bananas.. 2 tbsp powder is plentiful for a sandwich and at only 45 calories.. vs 200 calories!
5,"I never thought anything could pull me away from my Jif, but this stuff actually tastes good. Okay, it's maybe not quite as good as the big J, but for 85% less fat and calories it is well worth the slight difference."
5,These whole nutmeg are of excellent quality and have a full flavor.  Good buy!
5,"Nuts are packaged in air tight bag to keep them fesh away from oxygen and moisture. Makes great powder when I grind them in my hand grinder, much more aromatic and tasty than pre-ground nutmeg."
1,This product had live insect larva inside the nuts.  The nuts broke to pieces when squeezed with the fingers.  I do not recommend this product.  I have filed a claim for my refund as Frontier has not returned my messages.
5,Nuts are large and fragrant. They won't last too long as I use about one a week. Convenient way to shop as I live in the middle of nowhere.  Make sure you have plenty on hand for home made eggnog this holiday season.
5,This is of LOT of quality nutmeg. The bag is approx 9.5in x 11in and packed with whole nuggets 3/4 long in size end to end. A great buy!
5,"I looove freshly ground nutmeg!  This stuff looks and smells great, I haven't used it yet as I'm trying to rotate stock but I'm sure it's good by the look and smell :)"
5,"When cooking or baking, the freshness of your ingredients makes a huge difference in the flavor.  This product delivers that freshness."
5,These are very high quality.  I am addicted and now put fresh ground nutmeg on almost everything.  Very happy with purchase.
5,"I've wanted to buy whole nutmeg ever since I saw Rachel Ray using it.  I never even knew nutmeg came like this!  After seeing it at our bulk health store for $27per pound, I decided I was not going to be grinding fresh nutmeg;-) Amazon to the rescue.  Same product- half the cost.  Happy consumer!"
3,Grapes are very sweet.  Adding more Grape Juice Concentrate to sweeten the juice is overdoing it.  I wished Kedem would stop making a good product bad.
5,"These are actually very tasty little gummies and my little boy loves them. Make's a great treat. Quite a few fit into the package and they are decently sized as well. The gummi center is actually solid though, in case of any misunderstanding."
5,BEST WILD MOUNTAIN BLACKBERRY JAM I HAVE BEEN ABLE TO BUY. THHESE ARE THE TRUE SEEDLESS BLACKBERRIES
5,"Our dogs both LOVE this dog food and have been eating it since I discovered it.  I mix it into their canned food, and they eat it dry too!"
4,"Helped to relieve my dogs allergy symptoms! The bad odor is gone, and he loves this food better than any other! The only down side is previously, he was eating grain free, now he is putting weight on with this food! I am stepping up the exercise and feeding a bit less!"
5,my 3 dogs love it. Prior to using my spaniels had chronic ear infections. No more ear infections and healthier skin too. Highly recommend
5,I bought this in the hopes of extending my culinary skills to include Mochi. It is actually quite easy to make with this flour. I was pleased that the containing bags were sealed properly and not dumping the flour all over the shipping box. Always a great thing.
5,A nice accompainment to an Indian dinner is this chutney stirred into yogurt.  Have used this brand for 20 years.  It is excellent.
5,"A good rich, malty, bready assam that can stand up to milk & sugar.  As usual don't over steep an Assam.  Wonderful value for fair trade organic!"
3,"As others have mentioned, the taste is pretty bland. But it's cheap and if you put twice as much tea in it tastes almost as strong as fancier, more expensive brands. Almost."
5,After having only 2 previous Assam teas I can say this is without a doubt the best one I have tried yet. The price was the deciding factor when I purchased this and I am not displeased. I would recommend this product without hesitation.
5,"Ever since I discovered tea the way the British drink it in the late '70s, I've been searching for a good black tea that, with a bit of milk, would produce that same rich, smooth cup of tea.  This is it!  I love it, as do the many friends I've served it to.  I highly recommend it!"
5,Just received and made last night.  Very good tasting.<br />This 16oz bag is a lot of tea - more than I thought. Glad I have though.<br />Nice packaging -- but will put in tins because of the amount to keep it fresh longer.
3,"I decided to try this tea based on the description and reviews, but found it weak, with little flavor. For reference, I like my tea very strong and normally buy the Davidsonas English breakfast tea."
1,"I was sadly disappointed in this brand of Assam tea. Once properly brewed, the tea was weak. When I brewed another pot, I added more tea, in the hopes of making it drinkable.  The second pot was weak, and bitter."
4,"It is hard to get Assam tea in the store, let alone organic Assam.<br />I was pleased at how fast this one arrived and how nicely it is<br />packaged."
3,Perhaps just this batch... not a flavorful tea.  A milquetoast quality.  I like a robust tea so this may be my own misunderstanding of how this blend is supposed to taste.  I'm glad I tried it.
2,"Assam is my favorite type of tea, but I was not happy with this particular brand. It is much weaker than other assam teas I've tried, and seems to have no flavor no matter how strongly I brew it."
5,"As a tea junky, the quality of the product and the shipping/handling were great. I enjoy the tea and would buy more from them for sure."
5,"I use it to make large batches of chai for my wife who drinks it like crack.  Anyhow, she loves it, tastes good to me, i am no tea expert."
1,"Quote ""Assam tea is known for its body, briskness, malty flavor, and strong, bright color.""<br /><br />This offering is pretty abysmal, it is lacking in every department, maybe it was mislabeled. I am not sure what I am going to do with it!!"
5,I love this tea. Full bodied and malty. The packaging has a ziploc top to keep it fresh. Very nice tea for a heavy tea drinker.
1,STAY AWAY!!!!  You have been warned.  This is the most foul tasting rubber you wil ever try.  I am sorry I was forced to give it 1 star.
5,the pack did not last long!  they have none of the strange texture or flavour of most gluten free snacks. not as OVER THE TOP AMAZINGLY DELICIOUS as the ginger ones but still fab. they aren't cheap but they are worth every singe cent. we shall certainly be ordering more of these.
4,The cookies were good. Its good that they are gluten free and taste good because that's hard to do. Thank you.
5,"My son LOVES these cookies! they are the first yummy soft gluten free cookie we have found. You would never know they were gluten free, they taste that good!!"
5,I LOVE WOW! I just tried the snickerdoodle cookies and they are great! They also make really good chocolate chip chookies and brownies. I can't wait to try all their sweets!!!
5,This cookies are very good. I think there actually better then some regular cookies. I highly recommended them for people that are gluten free. There great.
5,"Snackmasters manufactures great turkey jerky. From what I've read this company was the original creator of the turkey jerky, so I decided to try and I have not been disappointed.  The turkey jerky is full of flavor and also very healthy!"
5,I just finished an 8 pack I ordered and just wanted to say this is the best jerky on the market. It has great flavor and it's very healthy. I definitely recommend!!
2,"I love SnackMasters' turkey jerky, so I naturally decided to try natural turkey jerky.  This turkey jerky is the same (or better) quality as the regular variety, but too dry.  I would recomend <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000EZMRRA"">SnackMasters Turkey Jerky, Teriyaki</a>, instead"
5,This is the best jerky I've ever eaten and makes a great snack for travel.
5,"This jerky is fantastic.  I'm somewhat of a jerky fanatic, and I've tried many kinds of jerky.  This one is awesome and you wouldn't know it was Turkey if you ate it and no one told you.  Highly recommended..."
5,"Our girls love the food, It's easy to order and have shipped to the house at a reasonable price. T"
5,My dogs dont like all of the weruva canned food but they love this.  Even finicky eaters cant resist it.
5,"I had been looking for individual packets to carry with me in my purse ,as when you eat out or travel ,you don't have to be with out. The price was great."
5,"I love this tea.  I've researched the health benefits and it's one of the healthiest things you can drink... Google it.  I like that it's caffeine free, and with a little honey, it's a treat any time of day. I'll be buying more when I run out."
5,"This is, by far, my favorite high-antioxidant decaf tea. The flavor is subtle but perfect. You can steep forever and the tea does not become bitter. It's delicious. Since getting this tea, I have not even considered trying another flavor of decaf."
5,"The Cherry Ripes arrived in perfect condition, very fresh and at rapid speed.<br />Couldn't ask for anything more!"
5,Good dog food. I always get this food for my Puggle. He is a smaller breed so he likes the small bits. Best you can buy on the market.
5,These beans were really very good.  Added a ham slice while cooking and came out great.  Each time I've made the soup it's be consistently yummy!
4,These are amazing chips but they just cost too much for the little amount that you get. They come from England so I suppose they have a way to travel. Hey just bring them to the states and I would be most happy!
5,"The Brit's have out done us. The flavor is supreme,they satisfy my hunger for steak and onions...<br />Get them while you can...  Their other flavors are great tooo"
5,"These are the best flavor chips, my daughter and I love these, taste like real bacon. Also they arrived quickly especially considering they shipped from england to california usa. I just ordered more. I ordered from Olieshop UK."
5,I had a bag of these during a trip to London. I was looking for Walker's Frazzles but this was the only bacon-flavored chips I could find at the Tesco. The taste is very similar to Frazzles if not better. It tastes just like bacon! Even suitable for vegetarians.
5,"This chips kind of reminded me of bacon bits. The six small bags were the perfect size and there's no MSG. They were a little expensive, but considering they came from the UK it's understandable. Half the price was in the shipping. They are well worth the indulgence once in awhile."
5,"If you like salt and vinegar crisps (chips), but would prefer the vinegar to lighter, you should love these.  Salty and slightly tangy and yummy!"
5,"I loved the chips they were AWESOME!!! but that's just me. It arrived Earlyer than expected in the mail so that was even better, no crushed chips yay!"
4,The crisps are awesome. Give me English crisps over american chips any day! I recommend them to everyone. The smoky bacon are my favorite but the cheddar bacon are almost as good.
1,Item came promptly however the crisps were 3 months past their freshness date. Was told I would get replacements.  Still waiting.
4,"Bought these the other day while I was in Canada, they are delish! If they were available here in the states I would buy them."
5,I had these wonderful chips in Ireland a few years ago on vacation and was sad that I could not find them in America.  Now that I have I will be in so much trouble ordering them all the time.  I love these chips!!!
5,I got into a routine of eating oatmeal every morning for breakfast about four months ago. These are a great purchase given the price and home delivery. The subscribe and save option is amazing!
5,"love the oat meal cooking in cool water add spices eat, will buy again add ripe banana good needs no sugar"
5,Better to add what you want rather than buy the flavored which has a lot of salt. I can even bring these to work. It really holds you!
5,This is the best sized portion oatmeal available today for use when I am backing packing.  I like that they add no other sugars to the product so I can do that myself. Great Camping Food!!
4,I wanted packets of oatmeal so I could store these at work rather than a huge tub for breakfast and this is perfect. It gives a reasonable serving per packet especially when I'm on a diet and I can flavor it however I like.
1,"Very light for the price. I buy usually at Sam's and they carry nice big packs and cost something about same.<br />Don't spend your money for that, especially with ""special promotion""= ""special suction""."
5,"this is a great tea. if you are familiar w/ the tea that Aveda used to make, you will be pleasantly surprised at this VERY similar and cheap product. needs no sweetner (and i am a tea w/ sugar person) and is caffeine free tea too. it is D-LISH!"
5,"This tea is simply amazing!  It definitely has a very exotic flavor and has a very very good taste and especially the after taste is the best!  When you drink the tea, you can feel the sensations of the licorice and mint and it taste incredible!  A must drink!"
4,"Yogi Tea has introduced a winner in Egyptian Licorice Mint.  It's the perfect after dinner herbal tea.  It doesn't have a strong licorice or mint flavor, but instead a delightful synthesis.  I feel like it's easy on my tummy and doesn't need food to complement it.  What more could you ask for?"
5,"I can't find this tea in any store, so every few months I get another order of it on Amazon.  Just delicious, sweet tasting tea.  Whenever I make a cup for someone to try, they are shocked at how sweet it is, and with no sugar added!  I love love love it."
4,Another delightful tea from Yogi Tea with rich sweet flavor.  Use two bags and enjoy a great dessert without sugar for the low carb lifestyle.
5,"i actually like it, it has very strong flavor of mint.<br /><br />you just can't drink it too often :) but it happens with every product with strong flavor."
5,This is one of my favorites-  I carry it and lemon ginger when I travel.  It's good for quieting the stomach and the aroma is refreshing especially when sitting on a plane.
5,"I never write reviews but this tea is worth taking the time to write about.  I'm an avid coffee drinker, trying to kick the coffee habit and tried this tea.  Wow! I love it!  The big plus is you don't need to use any sweetner as it is naturally sweet!  Is my new favorite drink, hot or cold!!!!"
5,"I really enjoy the Yogi Licorice tea and was really wondering how mint & licorice would work.  So, I finally ordered and am so pleasantly surprised.  This is delicious and I will be replacing the straight licorice with the licorice mint in future.  So nice to curl up with."
5,"This tea has one of the cleanest, most refreshing flavors I have ever tasted. Licorice and mint is a winning combination anyway. This is a great way to cleanse your system, detox and purify yourself, all at once."
5,Love this tea and drink it daily. It is a great tea with a great taste. It sooths the stomach and aids digestion.
5,"This tea is awesome, and also way cheaper from amazon than from the official website. All my friends that try it are hooked."
3,I love the licorice tea so I thought I would love this too.  But the mint is too strong and you don't really get the licorice flavor.  I'll stick to the Egyptian Licorice instead.
5,"I love this tea.  It is my favorite ever.  I first bought a box when vacationing on Maui, then couln't find it at any of my local stores when we got home, so had to order it online.  I would no doubt drink this tea exclusively if not for the reviewer who thinks it almost killed him!"
5,"I love this tea,it is so sweet it tastes as if it has sugar or some sweetner added. My favorite evening drink."
5,I love the texture of this salt - I use it in place of kosher salt for finishing food because it looks great and has a wonderfully irregular texture. Perfect for sprinkling on salted caramels or other sweet salty goodies.
5,"I've tried dozens of brands and types of sea salt - Maldon's salt flakes are, without a doubt, the best I've found so far.  Constant rave reviews from all who try it.  The Maldon folks are almost fanatical about delivery and packaging - never a problem in 4 orders."
5,Maldon salt is the best for seasoning proteins before saute or grilling.  It makes a really good finishing salt as well.
5,"What a bargain.  I usually buy pricier salts, but after using this one, that may never happen again.  I share boxes with my family, and they love."
5,I make flavored salts as gifts and the crunchy texture of these salts is perfect. My friends love them. They sound as good as they taste when you use your fingers to sprinkle on food.
4,Product is exactly as described in it's literature. Nice flaky salt with a gentle flavor.
4,"This salt is good for putting on top of focaccia.  It looks good and has a nice crunch without getting a ""rock"" in your mouth."
5,One of the best in the world.  First tried this salt in Scotland and have been buying it ever since.  Worth the price.
5,"The first time we had Maldon salt was actually at a local Ice Cream shop, my husband fell in love and now uses it regularly as his primary finishing salt. Great Flavor and mouth feel. Completes just about any dish."
5,I use this salt and don't tell people that I'm using it.  It makes me look like I'm a chef!I only use it as a finishing salt though<br /><br />Ron
5,"Save yourself the trip to Williams Sonoma and save some $$, too.  I have used Maldon Salt for years.<br />Good product for cooking.  I won't use any other."
3,The pork chops from Omaha Steaks were very tasty but at the same time exceptionally dry. Pork is usually dry meat but these were to the extreme. Possibly shipping them frozen and keeping them frozen was partly the problem.
5,These are a healthy and easy to digest chew for a snack in the evening for my Cairn Terrier.
5,I'm giving this treat to my dogs for 3 years and they love it!  Very healthy and made in USA!<br />Very fast shipping too!
5,"This is the only digestable chew treat that our 7 lb. Yorkie can tolerate. In addition to being healthy and flavorful, these sweet potato sticks are gentle on his stomach and help to keep his teeth clean. Great value."
5,My Maltese loves these treats and has never had any adverse reaction to them.  It's hard to find natural products so I was very pleased when I located this one.
5,"Good value, excellent treats that dogs love. Especially good for dogs that may have allergies because they are made of sweet potatoes with nothing else added. Dogs love them because they are crunchy (and most likely a bit sweet)."
5,Keeps teething puppies busy and happy while chewing on a natural non messy product! We love it! Our older dog is also happy with the large sweet potato chew by sam's yams.
1,I thought I would change up my dogs food from Newmans organic to this product but it was terrible my dog refused and when i put cooked chicken in it and the dog at it the dog had massive diarreha. I threw it away.
5,It was delivered very quickly. I bought this because it is grain free - my dog however didn't care for it - I think the kibble is rather small and doesn't have the aroma that other salmon based foods do.  We are donating the remainder to the animal rescue group
5,"My dog went for it from the start. I was using the same brand but a lower quality food and my dog still likes both, but I'm switching to the Instinct line for quality"
5,My two papillons absolutely love Instinct dry dog food.  Grain free and high in protein and all natural ingredients.  How can you go wrong?<br /><br />I rotate my dogs among the different varieties.
5,"The Nestle Crunch seems to get picked out from the bag as a favorite. However, since I love Butterfinger Baby Ruth candy bars, that's ok with me. A winner in the office."
5,"Ordered this for my mom's trick or treaters , I am sure they will enjoy it and the parents will have fun their sugared up kids ."
3,The gift looks much cheaper when it arrives in the mail. The picture listed on Amazon makes the basket look very classy. It is still a nice gift for someone that needs sugar-free snack items. I just think that you might be able to find a better bargain somewhere else.
2,"I WAS SOMEWHAT DISAPPOINTED WITH THESE APPLE CHIPS.  I HAVE PURCHASED SENECA APPLE CHIPS IN THE PAST--I REALLY LOVED THEM. I THOUGHT THESE WOULD BE SIMILAR, BUT THEY ARE RATHER TASTELESS, THE CHIPS ARE TOO BIG, & THEY HAVE A MUSHY CONSISTENCY.  I WOULD NOT BUY THEM AGAIN."
4,"I like it better letting this power powder tingle directly on my tongue.<br />Only take in small doses though. Pleasantly sour, but too much of it unmixed at once will cause coughing and choking.<br />Excellent source of C & B12 vitamins."
5,"I use anchovies often in Caesar salad, seafood pastas, etc and got tired of repackaging the unused filets, forgetting them in the fridge, etc. I find I get the same flavor from this paste with the convenience of just screwing the cap back on until the next time."
5,"This is a good product.<br />As it becomes increasingly difficult to find anchovy paste in store, this is a convenient way to shop.<br />Amazon is G-R-E-A-T !"
5,"I love giving these kits as gifts to my friends and clients. It's a great housewarming or hostess gift. Plus you support a great organization that employs and trains people with disabilities. It's a win-win! <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B007O0KABS"">Prairie Spices Gift Set</a>"
4,Before you pot your plant take the amount of soil you need and put it in the oven at 350 degrees for an hour. This will take care of any gnats or larva that are currently in the soil. I have used this method and have remained gnat free.
1,"I've been using this for the past few years, but this year, I've not only found the bugs, but I actually have a WEED that grew and punctured through the bag!  I kept wondering where all the weeds were coming from in my planter boxes, and now I know!"
1,Don't buy this soil; it's full of flying black bugs. Check the Internet with a search for Miracle Grow organic potting soil and bugs and you'll find I'm far from alone. Disgusting.
5,"I ordered three bags of this potting mix, and there was not a gnat to be found!  Just finished repotting plants and am totally pleased<br />with Miracle-Gro - super value and top quality."
2,"I transplanted a ficus to a larger pot (no gnats previously), and soon after our bathroom was infested with gnats.  I like the response I get from my plants outdoors with MiracleGro's potting mix, but I will never use this again for indoor plants."
1,Don't the sellers read these reviews and say something to the manufacturer. It is a terrible that Amazon can sell this product to the public.
5,I have used this brand potting mix now for 3 seasons and had no problems at all. It is the only potting mix I use now and I've seen no signs of any form  of bug. I do get it in the bigger bags but I'm not sure that would make a difference.
1,"I bought 4 bags of this stuff and repotted everything in my house. Within a week I had gnats all over my house.  I have tried everything and cant get rid of them! Terrible, use a different organic product."
5,"This is the only brand of potting soil that I trust. My family has been gardening with it for years. I find that it works great. However, I only by mine at Walmart, where it is cheaper."
5,I write this in 2011.  I bought many bags of Miracle Grow soil at Home Depot.<br /><br />It sure works great for me.  Potted plants flourish in it.  No problems whatsoever
2,"Like many others have said, Gnats! It would be a fine product except for that. Used some insecticidal soap, so far so good. Caveat emptor!"
4,"I read the reviews, and being a novice gardener (was one of my chores as a kid, a very long time ago!), I bought -- but no gnats!  I wouldn't know a gnat if I met one, but I encountered nothing moving, and my plants are still in good shape."
5,Miracle grow potting soil<br />I am pleased with the product. It arrived in a very timely manner as described. I could not be happier with my purchase.
1,"Poor product.<br /><br />What was I thinking, looking for mail-order seafood at Amazon.<br /><br />Buy locally!"
5,I enjoy the ginger taste of this candy.  And it really helps settle my stomach.  I had originally bought it in a store but found it at Amazon at a much better price.
4,These wafers very good and tasty. But where is expiration date on the packaging?! Why a manufacturer does not consider it necessary to specify it? Why only lot number?
5,"Our family loves these chips, they are light, not too greasy, and the seaweed taste is fantastic. My wife is from Japan so she turned us on to these chips."
5,"I don't usually like chocolate cake but, this has a real chocolate flavor. As I expected, General Mills cake mixes didn't let me down."
5,Packaging was excellent.  Candy arrived in perfect condition.  So very fresh....I have never eaten a kit kat this crisp and fresh.  In my time I have eaten my fair share of kit kat candy.  So I have to say this was a very pleasant transaction.
5,am ordering theses again..love the mixture so something for everyones liking. the variety is the awesome plus here. order yours today.
5,"I love kit kat. And I am very happy to have white kit kat in this set. However, I hope that Kit Kat in the US will have as many flavors as those in Japan."
4,"How ""D"" ma fren. I'z setten here figurin what to do with the other 3 bags I gots with this odor. Already gave the kids nex-door Dia-Beet-is. Jus kidden a course. 8 all that came ta me and luved every bite. Good lil suckers...try them urself. I knows u'll be back fur more. Yahoo pardner."
5,3/10/11<br /><br />  Delicious variety of chocolate candy!<br /><br />  Will definately buy again!<br /><br />  Seller is A++++++++++!<br /><br />  esantana32
4,"It was a nice package very awesome collection (regular,dark and white)<br /><br />But my little concert about the very mini mini size"
3,"These treats are VERY large, even after breaking into the three pieces that are scored.  Too large for small dogs (maltese, pomeranians) .  They can be cut into even smaller pieces but it is not real convenient to do so.  Dogs do love them however.  Would be great if smaller sizes were available."
5,I had to have these Sprinkles!<br />It's a rare color to find & I love it!<br />Looks beautiful on Cakes!
2,These sprinkles do not taste good at all. Especially if you eat what you decorate right after you decorate it. Not that impressed
3,"sparkles are ok - but melt into the frosting and don't show up as nicely as they should, container was 1/3 empty. Packaged nicely, shipped on time, just was disappointed iwth the product itself."
1,This gum is crumbly and the lackluster flavor fades faster than any gum I've ever chewed. It's gone in around 10 seconds.
5,this came super fast and well packed and I really like the product on the cakes that I made....It looked great!
1,I used to buy Gerber baby foods and was thrilled when they started carrying organic foods. Then I discovered that they add gelatin! Why? It is disgusting and has absolutely no nutritional value.  I will not be buying Gerber products again. Earth's Best is actually organic.
1,"Do not buy product contain gelatin. Gelatin in baby food ??? Why gerber ???, Do not buy if you follow vegetarian or kosher/Halal regime."
3,My twins love this!! BUT Walmart sells them for $1/ for a 2pack!  Worth going there to save the extra $!
5,"My twins recently got a little picky on the baby food... We tried this one, and they both love it.  They are now 10 mos old.<br /><br />My twins love it!"
5,It tastes fine and the baby loves it. has DHA and is organic - which is important when having berries (but redundant when it comes to bananas)
5,"I was thrilled to find this veggie combo with DHA, great price! Perfect packaging for easy storage if he doesn't finish it in one sitting."
5,This 2nd foods is delicious and nutrient. My Babe swallows it quickly and wants the next one at once. I think it is because all of my family like the taste of cheese.
5,My 18m old loves this for his morning breakfast. This is one of the few flavors he will eat. We give him 1x baby food breakfast & 1x yogurt every day.
5,My daughter loves this food! I tried it and its good!Added bonus is the DHA.
2,"I wouldn't say my twins are picky eater, but they wouldn't eat this one.  They eat just about every Gerber's organics."
5,"Ok, sounds crazy i know but i heard about this baby food diet and figured whats there to loose. The food tastes good, and im sure your baby will like it too hahaha!"
5,My baby will not eat peas or green beas but he LOVES this - go figure.<br /><br />Don't rely on bogus 1 star reviews that criticize the fact that it contains fish oil which it clearly states on the packaging!!!!
5,"What else is there to say? They arrived promptly, perhaps more on time than expected. Expiration date was not like NEXT DAY so they were good to go!"
1,I liked these tubs for a few months and then realized that they contain fish oil and gelatin. Why put these products in a VEGETARION seeming food? Beware! I'm going to review all of Gerber's products carefully now. Totally dissapointed with Gerber.
5,"This tea might not taste delicious but has an ok flavor, the effects it has on my body are wonderful; it helps with acid reflux and it works wonders when i feel nauseated."
1,"This detox tea tastes so bad that I had to force it down! I thought that it would be a good thing to do a natural detox, but I could hardly get through one box, and had to gulp it down quickly to try to not taste or smell it. It also stained my teeth! I would NEVER take this tea again!"
5,These salts are just terrific.  They add marvelous depth and flavor to your food.  So much better than the salts you can buy in the grocery store.  I heartily recommend all of them.
5,Very good and taste homemade.  Large Brownies and individually wrapped.  Quick delivery too.
5,"This seasoning has awesome flavor. There is no need to add anything else, except for maybe some garlic. Very authentic Jamaican curry."
5,"The best Jamaican Curry powder there is to my taste. I like to get this non-hot version and then control the spiciness with the addition of fresh scotch bonnet peppers. Outstanding curry powder, I love it!"
5,"My elderly Papillon, Beau, has had skin allergy/itch problems for the past few years.  Maybe it's age or maybe it's the Pinnacle Trout & Sweet Potato, but he's no longer scratching himself raw.  Thank goodness!  The ingredients in this food seem really good and it's the only food I give him."
2,A German Shepherd breeder recommended this food for my itchy GSD.  No way.. he HATES this food.  It smells like cat food actually.  I have a case and a half left.. guess I'll donate it to the shelter.  Shame as it is expensive.. they won't eat the dry kibble in the trout formula either.
5,This food is excellent for labradors. I use this for my puppies first food through adult. Price is a value and can't beat free shipping! Will order again.
5,I ordered this food on Tues. and received the very next day from the supplier.  Thank you for great expeditious customer service.
5,"Recommended by our vet, and our dogs love this food. Usually mix it with some canned food / sardines / veggies / yogurt.<br /><br />So happy this is available via Amazon Prime. At a reasonable price point as well. Please, Amazon - keep this in stock! Not available in my area otherwise. THANKS!!!!"
5,this is the only dog food my highly allergic golden retriever can eat without getting hotspots!!!
2,"If you have a dog, you probably know the distinctive ""dog fart"" odor.  This food, for some reason, multiplied that for one of my two dogs.  It really turned our house into a constant dog gas zone.  Wow.  It's supposed to be a pretty good dry dog food, but beware of the possibility of DOG GAS."
4,"Del Monte is a good brand.  I've read that we are going to experience a shortage of corn, and I use it in soups and stews, so I wanted to have enough on hand at a reasonable price.  This will help with my grocery bill the coming winter.<br />When I guy in bulk, I always purchase through Amazon."
4,"Good for K-Cup coffee.  My husband told me to order 4 boxes, so I did.  Didn't realize until we got it that I'd ordered 4 boxes of 4 boxes.  Oops!  I wasn't a coffee drinker before this, but now I'm obligated to help him get through my purchasing error."
5,My husband loves chocolate and Lindor Truffles are his absolute favorite!! He loves the rich smooth chocolate with the creamy filling and the variety of flavors. This order was a Christmas gift and they arrived right on time and in perfect condition. We will definately order again.
5,Other than frying this oil has many uses my favorite use is making Italian dressing. This is a Super Food why are we not growing this amazing plant in the US? [...]
4,Great probuct to use in a lotion bar. Does have its own smell that you need to be careful about with other scents.
1,"My wife, just today, bought a 12 oz pkg of this at our grocery story for $8.50. The cost here seems like price-gauging."
5,"this is one of my favorite coffees try it you'll agree i love the whole bean coffee so fresh and tasty , no need for any creamer , nor sugar"
5,"Seriously, this stuff is AWESOME! I literally could eat this by the spoonful straight out of the container!! Best thing since Reese cups!"
5,"I love this peanut butter.  It tastes incredible!  I wouldn't say that I feel like I'm eating a dessert.  To me, it's not THAT sweet.  The sweetness of the chocolate is more subtle, but delicious nonetheless.  I also don't use jelly with this, nor do my children feel like they need jelly with it."
5,I live this product. Finely ground and I can use it knowing I am using a whole grain flour that will not cause a reaction to my gluten intolerance.
5,Nice robust flavor.  Tastes very good with cream and sugar or black.  I will continue to buy it.
5,I am just beginning to enjoy loose teas and this was a great introduction. A very good deal.
4,"A very good English Breakfast tea--tastes great, even with milk.  The only down-side is that the leaves are small and they slip through the holes in my teapots."
5,"Loose tea is so much better than tea bags.  I have two cups every morning, and sometimes want more.  Even the second cup doesn't get bitter or harsh.  Of course you have to drink it with no sugar or cream."
4,This is my favorite kind of tea.  I use the loose tea in my Kurig.  It works great and the six small cans are easy to use and to store.
5,"I have had better teas, but they were more than twice the cost of this one. This is my second purchase and I am very happy of the quality at the price I paid. I will be buying this item again in the future."
5,Excelent quality one of the best tea. The pack of 6 of one kind should migrate a different flavors.
4,"Rated by America's Test Kitchen as the best tea for iced tea, Twinings English Breakfast tea is perfect for a hot cuppa or for a batch of fresh iced tea. Amazon has the best price I could find for this product, and I have been buying it online from them for several years."
4,"Orange Pekoe tea is delicious, fragrant and taste friendly.  It seems to be disappearing off of grocery shelves in favor of the mixed blends, of which I am NOT a fan.  I recommend this taste to all tea drinkers who desire quit balance and taste!"
2,The product itself was inedible and mostly crumbs. It even smelled bad. The star is there because of the packing material. My cats LOVED the packing material. Played in it for days. I'd almost buy the product again for that packing material.
1,"These cookies had a horrible taste, nothing like the sesame cookies we get in New Jersey. Too many flavors competing with the anise. Yuck."
5,These crackers are amazing.  I absolutely love them.  Anyone who trys them will never buy another cracker.  The quality is outstanding.  I am Italian and these crackers taste just like the crostini that my mother used to make when we lived in Italy.
1,"Yes, I tasted them - they taste like chemicals but I guess that's what you should expect from a joint supplement.  My Shih tzu & Pekingese would not eat them."
2,"My pug is, perhaps, too spoiled when it comes to treats. I ordered the chicken and the beef and gave her the chicken first. She turned her nose away. I chopped it and added gravy. She ate the gravy. So I cannot attest to the effectiveness of the product."
4,They made my home smell like a restaurant because they are so potent. I deducted a star though because only 3 out 4 of my dogs like them.
5,I BOUGHT THESE FOR MY SMALL DOG WHO WAS HAVEING JOINT PROBLEMS WITHIN A FEW WEEKS SHE IS NOW DOING GREAT NO MORE LIMPING GREAT PRICE AS WELL. IF YOUR LOOKING FOR A JOINT SUPPLIMENT THIS IS A GOOD CHOICE.
5,"My dog LOVES these treats whatever flavor they may be.  These are her favorites and very healthy too. <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000H0ZJHW"">Zuke's Chicken-Flavored Mini Naturals Dog Treats, 16 Ounces</a>"
1,My dog refused to eat any of these.  I had to give them away.  Beware if your dog is picky.
5,A treat for my dogs that is actually good for them. Also at much better price than I had found previously at my local retailers....Great product at a huge savings - what could be better!
4,"Having a golden retriever with allergies, I have tried so many products.  Zukes does not set off the allergies and gives my girl what she needs now that she is getting older.  She moves better now."
5,These are healthy treats plus they will help my Service dog when she gets older. Seeing how she do's alot of work for me.
5,"Liked Zuke's Hip Action Natural Dog Treats, roasted chicken. My dogs liked this and considered it as a treat. They seem to run about a bit better too."
5,"My boys hips are getting worse with old age, so every little bit helps.  My dog loves these, and i like that it is made in the USA."
5,"My 5 month old german shepherd/rotty loves it. Its kind of like licorice, easy to break apart but does not fall apart. Too bad it was gone in less than a week, lol"
5,I was not sure if I was giving my lab the treat to make me feel better or if it would really work. She is running more on our walks and has an easier time getting up from her naps!!<br />Great product plus she loves the taste
5,"Mz Sparkle loves these and I was working out of town and couldn't find a place that carries them.  It was so easy just to order them from Amazon...I had gotten the Prime membership for kinda the same reasons...new city and difficulty finding my ""go to"" purchases.  Sparkle was delighted."
5,"My bestfriend deserves good treats that are also good for her, so I chose these.  They really do make a big difference to her activity level!"
5,My dogs love these! It's a great treat to give your dog just to make them happy. These are great for the price when you can get free shipping.
5,My dogs love Zuke's Hip Action Treats.<br /><br />I don't know if you realized it or not but the individual bags you were selling were cheaper than the three pack.
5,SO glad that I found something that is healthy and yummy for my puppy. She gobbles them up whenever I give them to her.
5,"My dog Goldie loves these treats, and they are supposed to be good for her.I will continue to try and give her healthy treats, because I love her."
5,Zuke's is the best and my dog loves to eat them up............<br />Zuke's is the best and my dog loves to eat them up............
5,my 11 year old lab can once again run and play ball with my freinds. she  loves them. it like a wonder treat!!
5,Love their products! Love the idea behind them and the fact they help animals with cancer!  Zukes for president please!
5,"I gave my  14 year old terrier these treats and really believe that these have helped him to feel better. He has lately been playing with his ball, (he self plays and had not been doing this for years) happy to watch him on long walks. He is very happy to keep walking. He is doing very well"
5,These are just great overall treats that my dog loves. Easy to break apart to make them last longer. My cats like them too.
5,The vet recommended glucosamine/chondroitin for the terriers to help with arthritis and knee problems. I can really tell the difference in my 11-year old dog. They love the flavor of these bites which have a strong meaty smell.
5,My dog loves these treats and they really have helped her arthritis. I have reordered! I have tried some items from the local pet stores but nothing she likes as well and that works as well too!
5,"Helps the dogs as they age and keeps their joints working. It must also taste good, as they practically inhale it!"
5,My two Chihuahuas absolutely love these treats. They get one at bedtime and follow me around until I give it to them. These are great healthy moist treats for a good price. Would highly recommend.
5,Our older dog has arthritis in his right hip.  These had good recommendations so I purchased for him.  He loves them!  Our retriever is younger but I've given them to him also just as a preventative.
5,"These treats are good for dogs, all natural and yummy! My black lab loved them and went through one a day! Hopefully they helped with her hips!"
5,"My dogs love these treats!  They get one after they take their medicine, and there's no problem at all getting them to swallow their pills as long as I have the jar of Zuke's out when I call them over."
5,"I was first introduced to Zuke's at the Health Expo in Anaheim.  They were kind enough to give me samples to take home to my dog.  Firstly, she loves them and she's picky.  Secondly, it seems to help her Arthritis."
5,"My dog really loves these treats - and he's very picky.  He is 11 years old and was previously having problems with his knees.  Since we have been giving him these, it seems he feels better!"
5,"I have a finicky basenji and he loves these treats. My dogs are also getting up in years but their joints and bones remain strong. I don't know if these treats contribute to that, but I've been giving them to them for a long time, so maybe so."
5,"my dog loves them and I think they help her, even though we do have her on medicine for her hips. You can also break them in half if you don't want to give the full treat all the time."
5,"I have been giving these treats to my dogs for the past 3 years or so. Never upset their stomachs and every time I say a word with ""tion"" on the end they get so excited.<br />Great products, great ingredients and above all a very trustworthy company!"
5,These treats are great! My dogs love them and they are natural and healthy. You can't beat that. : )
5,My lab loves anything Zukes. He will do almost anything for a piece.  I'm happy knowing it contains glucosamine because he is still young large breed and walks up and down stairs. It also smells good and is easy to break apart for training.
5,The vet recommended we give our dog Dr Zuke's Hip Action and it was difficult to find in this area so we were pleased to locate it on Amazon.  Our dog loves the taste of the moist chicken flavored squares.
3,My dogs love these treats but to tell you the truth I can't tell if they are helping their arthritis or not.
5,"My dog loves these treats -- they're perfect because they're small enough, so I can give her lots without feeling like I'm giving her something bad!"
5,I should say...my dogs love these! I like the ingredients as far as dog treats go. They are nice and soft and chewy. Make great treats!
5,My dog loves the treats and she is actually less stiff after a hard day of playing!  A great treat for helping our pets to be healthier!
5,the dog likes it and doing well with it. takes 2 per day. standard poodle is 11 years old.
5,My 12 yr old cat has soft tissue problems with her hips and upper rear legs and Hip Action has made a world of difference with her mobility.<br /><br />I highly recommend this product.
5,The first bite was kind of hard to bite down but MY GOSH they were good! Both my kids 2 and 5 loved them!!
4,"Good product for the price. Can be used in curries, chutneys and as a condiment. No comlplains. Happy with the product."
5,I really enjoy this blend of oatmeal and other grains.  It is a delicious way to start the day.  The fruit is very good-tastes fresh.
4,A perfect quick breakfast meal you can keep in your desk or pack in a bag on a trip. I loved the combination of oats and barley and it was the perfect amount of sweetness.
3,"I bought this product because of the convenience to take anywhere. Price is great, but the taste was pretty bland. I was definitely full after eating this, but the taste wasn't what I expected. Try for yourself!"
2,"This oatmeal was very bland tasting.  I could taste a little vanilla flavor, but not the fruit.  Still I suppose I can buy some minced peach fruit cups, and mix one in.  It was easy to prepare and pretty filling.  I just expected a lot more flavor."
2,"arrived on time, all that is well, but did not taste good! i mean it's quick, microwaveable, etc., but the taste was off and i couldn't even finish the pack of 6."
1,"While some of their other varieties are ok, this one tastes rancid. Also, with any of them, if you reheat the 2nd portion in the container, the plastic coating on the interior crumbles off right into the remaining 'oatmeal' (it is only partially oatmeal!)"
2,"Was a good product in theory but the oatmeal was flavorless, the fruits were ok, and it contained hard chunks that would not soften even after reheating it for an extra 1 minute.<br /><br />Seriously not worth buying but i do recommend the black bean soup. It kicks ass."
5,"Very delicious. The combo of oatmeal and barley is a nice change. It's warm and filling-- the amount is more than enough to fill you up. The peach and raspberry make it flavorful, yet it's not too sweet like most instant oatmeal products out there. It's just right."
5,"Taste really good, and good for you!<br /><br />of the three oatmeals offered by McDougall's line, this one is my favorite"
5,"This stuff is great. The fruit is tasty, the oats are tasty, it cooks quickly and evenly, and if you're not really a vegan I recommend topping it off with a bit of milk or half-and-half. AWESOME."
5,I absolutely love this oatmeal. Bought it originally when I had a baby for convenience purposes only...and now it has become one of my staples!!
5,"This oatmeal is yummy, you can taste the peach and raspberry flavors, no need to add any milk or sugar...it has a nice sweet taste that dosn't overpower...great to take to work when you don't have time for breakfast...just add water and microwave."
5,This is a wonderful breakfast.  It taste like grandmother made it.  Both this and the cranberry are wonderful whether they are healthy or not.
1,Didn't not like this at all. Didn't taste good and we hated it so much that we threw all of them in the trash. I don't recommend at all. I rather stick with the old fashion oatmeal. It comes out just right.
5,This is a vital ingredient in my BBQ sauce. Great flavor and consistency at a good value. Thank you for a great deal on some wonderful product.
5,"This is my pre-workout, afternoon pick me up every day drink, love it!  Dont' know about burning any actual calories but it's a great energy drink with no jitters."
4,Celsius drinks are low carbonated and that is important to me.  My very favorites are the orange and the wildberry.  Thay do not burn calories.  They burn calories if you exercise and eat right.  I think that is quite funny but also misleading if you don't read the fine print.
5,"I drink Celsius every a.m. Before I workout.  It tastes great and I feel great, never jittery like other drinks make me feel.  Thanks for the awesome price and the autoship!  I always have some on hand."
5,Celsius sparkling orange has a light carbonation and light orange taste which I love!<br />It is like an energy/metabolism booster drink combined with vitamins and minerals. I drink one every day.<br />Amazons subscription plan is the most cost effective way to buy!
3,"I thoroughly enjoy the Celsius Energy drinks.  My problem is with my last two shipments.  Both times, cans have been mangled and this last time to the point that one of the cans had opened.  You really need to reconsider your packaging or I will reconsider my future orders."
5,Way better than Red Bull and healthier too! Cannot stop drinking this stuff! Gets me going in the morning and keeps me going in the afternoon! Carbonated orange is the way to go!
4,"This product gives a great energy boost w/ no crashing, no calories. It's not the best tasting but if you drink diet, you will have no problem w/ the taste."
5,"I have been drinking orange celcius for a few years and i really love the flavor, helps give me the energy I need to get my day off to a good start"
5,This is the best tasting energy drink out there. not all syrupy like 99% of whats out there. gives you good energy without the gitters and it isnt loaded with artificials
4,"the orange flavor is pretty good and is carbonated, and its 1/3 the price of what i pay for it at the gym i go to."
4,I was pleased to find this product on Amazon.  It was sent to me with no shipping charges. I had trouble finding it in the local stores. It was also recommended to me by a personal trainer.  It is supposed to burn 100 calories.
5,great taste and a great way to start the day . I drink one when i get up and one more with lunch.
4,"Addictively-smelling spice, but way overpriced for the amount you get. Use it in any dishes, including non-Bengali preparations, or sniff it. ;-)"
4,"timely delivery, as advertised. good for candy, I used it for jello jigglers."
5,"The product is wonderful. However, the package contents were all bent and dinged when it arrived. I suspect the lack of expertise and lack of air-packets in packaging. One can was almost bent to a point of puncture."
5,Nice taste. I got it as a gift and the it was a big hit. Would certainly buy it again.
5,"this stuff is great, very creamy. I use it for my hair deep conditioner mix along with honey, olive oil and conditioner and it feels amazing."
5,"Excellent product and quickly shipped. I use this oil for cooking eggs, steaks, fish, you name it. Avocado oil is a great alternative."
5,"I use this oil for dipping breads and for making salad dressing. It has a very nice flavor, it tastes like avocados but is not overpowering."
5,"Avocado oil has a high flash point and can be used where Canola oil is called for.  It does give food a yummy flavor and, as olive oil, is rich in monounsaturated fatty acids and low in saturated fat.  Our family loves it!"
5,This oil has a very light flavor. I love it on my salad more than olive oil. I use it in the frying pan for cooking and it has a high heat point. Great price and now I'm hooked on this healthy avacado oil.
5,"I can't believe I used olive oil for so long!  This is so much better for cooking meats or veggies in a pan.  It has a wonderfully high smoke point, and a light flavor that allows the rest of the ingredients to shine through.  Adding this one to my kitchen for good!"
5,"my  whole family love it, even my six-years old twins like the salad prepared with it! healthy and yummy."
5,"You can fry, saute, and make wonderful salad dressing. Very creamy taste and a must for your well stocked kitchen."
5,"This avocado oil is one of the most multitaskful useful products ive ever used... Great for skin, hair, and cooking. A must-have product!"
5,"Really high heating point, all the goodness of olive oil, but lighter flavor.  Makes a lovely mayonnaise, salad dressings, etc.  Plus, well, the container is damned attractive.  It looks so nice sitting on the kit hen counter."
5,"I love this oil and use it mainly for cooking or doing my hair regimen.  I have to order it from Amazon because I cannot find it in my hometown Greenville, MS."
5,"The Avocado oil is delishious. I use it or Baking Biscuits and Bread, Dipping and as a sallad dressing. With the high smoke point, its good for frying. It makes good fryed Eggs. The BIG PLUS IS THE HEALTH BENEFITS.<br />  cjc"
2,"didnt really like this oil, i know its good for your health, but didnt like the taste when added to food, or when i made a dressing for salad.  smoked up the house, when i cooked some fish in a pan with it, even on medium heat."
5,"Love, love this stuff.  I've also served it to several guests and they too, really enjoyed this oil.  Will be ordering more!!"
5,"I love this! My mom tried some and I had to order it for her, too. I enjoy cooking with it, but it's great on salad as an alternative to olive oil (I don't care for traditional dressings)."
1,The oil tastes like bland olive oil. It has no taste of avocados in salads. Too expensive for its poor quality.
3,"Odd tasting, boarding on rancid.<br />I am not sure if this was just a bad batch? I do not care for it... I had avocado oil before, but it tasted noting like this."
5,I think the packaging is just beautiful - like a gift tin. I've been using it as a skin moisturizer (sometimes I mix it with aromatherapy and coconut oil so it doesn't smell like avocado oil) and I've seen a reduction in my stretch marks.
1,I ordered this over a month ago and have not received the product and have not received an answer from the  company as to why I did not get the product.  Buyer beware!!!  Over $40 down the tubes!
1,"Despite what the previous, obviously fake reviews claim this product doesn't do anything to prevent hangovers.  Drink water instead and save yourself $24.  No such thing as ""toxins"".  Psuedoscientific snake oil."
5,"This is the best coffee I have ever had ... and I may not be a coffee expert, but I consider myself picky!  This is extremely smooth and flavorful.  I wish the price were lower & we had to sign for our package that came directly from Jamaica (hey, it is real!), but it is so worth the splurge!"
5,"Since my first trip to Jamaica, I fell in love with the coffee.  The delivery date was right on and we had Blue Mountain coffee on Christmas morning!  For a treat, try drinking it with sweetened condensed milk!"
3,I'm a big Juan Valdez colombian fan. This Jamaican stuff doesn't have the kick that I love from coffee. It's sorta flat. Especially for something I spent $75 for two lbs. Goin Back To Colombian (twang twang)
2,there is no listed info.  what am i buying here?<br />pic shows FOUR PACKS. what size?  what flavors?<br />i can't buy something if i don't know what i'm buying.
5,FIRST!!!1!!!!!!11!!  that's all i really wanted to say.<br /><br />but this looks disgusting.  i don't know about you but i really don't like eating like an astronaut orphan.
5,"I fisrt bought Twinings Lady Earl Grey tea in Kirkwall, Orkney, Scotland. It was for a friend, but I got a box for myself. WOW. This sampler has some of the best varieties,including the Lady Earl Grey.You may also want to get the 4 Fruits. 40% off and free shipping, does life get better?"
5,BURNED OUT ON COFFEE THIS TEA FILLS THE VOID PERFECTLY FOR ME.I DEFINITELT WILL PURCHASE MORE TEA IN FUTURE .TWININGS MAKES GREAT TEA.
5,This is a great set for all real tea lovers!<br />I recommend adding a slice of lemon and sugar to Earl Grey to strengthen bergamot flavor!
5,Good variety of tea. I only wanted one box but I figured the rest could be gifts for people. I like the earl greys out of it. Not a bog fan of the others but everyone has their own tatse. Quality is good. No complaints.
5,The tea arrived as advertised.  It was a gift for my parents who love to have tea.  They do not like any Herbal varieties. Twinings tea is always good and this selection of teas (non - Herbal) was perfect for them.
5,"This is my new staple for morning tea selection.  All of them are good, clean tastes.  I like fairly bold tea, and these fit that bill.  The ""Lady Grey"" option was a nice surprise - just a hint of citrus, without sacrificing black tea taste."
5,"This tea is very good, not quit as good as mighty leaf - but it is very good.  Would buy again."
5,While having the twinning earl grey flavor decided to write the review as I felt it deserved one.Great stuff.Better than the other brands I have tried so far.Does a better job than Tazo awake to make you feel fresh.Will certainly order more...
5,"Good quality tea, and I like having a variety pack with the best flavors in one box. The price your pay on amazon.com is really great and beats supermarket by far."
5,This is a blend of black teas.  Some are more mild than others.  It is a very good deal for the money.
5,"Love that my favorites are all in one box. When company comes over, I can easily offer them a choice of some of the best teas out there."
5,"I bought this tea for my dad, who loves tea. The irish breakfast tea is his favorite for the very strong tea it makes."
4,"Bought this as part of a discount package where they had 40% off, and free shipping, great deal."
5,I have bought this sampler in the stores for years.  Amazon had a great bulk price.  You can not go wrong with the variety.
5,I like the variety in each box so I can use a different one each day. The flavors selected are also some of my favorites.
5,I like the twinings tea mix as you can try four different flavors from the same box.
5,"Once again, Twinings has come up with a winner.  This variety pack is highly recommended by me.  The flavors in this pack are the best of the best.  You should not be disappointed with this purchase.  When it comes to tea, Twinings is the best!!"
3,"Warning - this tea is packaged in the US, and not the UK.  Hence, it is weak and tasteless compared to the British equivalent.  Very disappointing."
3,"These chips are not bad to taste, but a little more money than I would pay for 1 bag of ""healthy"" chips."
5,The giant tootsie rolls taste much better than the little midgets.  The size of these big ones is perfect.  The size of this container is perfect and wil last quite some time.
5,These are wonderful!  I bought them for a birthday party.  They arrived safely; they had cool packs which kept them from melting in the Texas heat.
5,This has to be the best dressing/stuffing mix on the market.  I've made it every Thanksgiving and Christmas for the past 6 year.
5,"I love this stuff and was disappointed when it seemed that no one in town carried it anymore. Was glad to find it on Amazon. First of all, it is sweetened with Stevia :-) and it is flavored with real ginger.  If you like ginger ale and tolerate non-sugar sweeteners, you will like this soda!"
5,Excellent with gin! or not. A great bargain at the Subscribe & Save price. Haven't tried any other flavors because the ginger is sooooo gooood!
5,We love this ale.  My husband and I drink 2 - 3 cases of this each month.  It has actually helped our indigestion issues.
2,"We LOVED this product until shipments starting arriving in June--in Texas.  The taste is terrible!  No ginger taste left, not happy with the product at all any more.  Sad...loved it back in the winter and spring.  Guess it can't survive the heat in travel."
5,I have purchased some of the most expensive green tea's while in Japan.  This rival's all of them at a MUCH more affordable price.
5,The flavor was light but the tannin a bit stronger...I had to add a tad more cream!
5,This tea is great. It has a beautiful smoky flavor that can't be beat.  People who don't normally go for green tea will want a second cup. I highly recommend this tea.
5,"Hy, I'm very happy with my  Twinings green tea, is my favorite. Twinings Green Gunpowder Tea, Loose Tea, 3.53-Ounce Tins (Pack of 6)"
5,My sister had this sent to me as a birthday present. I enjoy a good cup of tea and this did not disappoint. Delicious and strong green tea. Only wish the package was bigger so I could enjoy more of the tea.
5,"It's Twinings.  Just the name recalls merry old England and makes it more of an adventure.  I like the packaging tins, too"
5,"Great flavor, easy to dispense, and a nice metal canister!  I'm not a big connoisseur of teas, but the fact that it was green tea helped me decide to try it.  And, for the nice price, I'm glad I did.  Will be nice to give a canister away here and there to friends and family."
5,This was a present for my grandmother who loves this tea. She was so pleased to get it. I am glad that I bought it and had it sent to her.
5,It used to be $24.99 for a six pack. Went up $10 Dollars in a year outrageous. The product is great but not that great or worth the price hike.
2,I ordered Twinings Green Gunpowder With Mint. Without notice I recieved regular not with Mint which is nothing like I ordered.
5,"The real thing-not just another sweetener in a cute little bottle. This is naturally packed with vitamins, minerals and essentials a body can use-and needs. I love it!"
5,"love this honey , the best i,ve ever had , will be ordering more and often ..try it you,ll love this stuff , great for afternoon slumps , great pick me up ....hmmmm tastes so good"
4,"The 50's candies brought back memories of the how I enjoyed my days as a kid.  I really enjoyed the candies, but it would have been better if there were more candies for the price."
5,"The Taste of Memphis gift basket is wonderful!  It is filled with goodies like delicious spreadable fruit and pecan cookies, a bottle of award winning BBQ sauce, and much more.  I was so pleased with my own Taste of Memphis gift basket that I am buying this gift for others this year!"
5,Really easy to buy from seller and the product is great! Will continue to buy from the seller. The beans are great tasting and really easy to open the little bags and to carry around.
4,Arrived super fast.  Works exactly as advertised. I would highly recommend this product. I think they do help me keep my electrolytes in balance when I'm outside working hard all day. I think they are yummy!
4,I sometimes have these about 45 mins before going for a 6 mile run in the evening. The mix of flavors is great but I find they stick to your teeth too much to have during a run. But they're a good change to the chomps and other sports nutrition options.
5,These jelly beans are great tasting and give you good energy. Do not expect to run 10 more miles or lift 100 more pounds. But it does give you a good enough quick burst and they are good to suck on while perform activities.
5,These are great if you need a pick me up before or after a work out. I would recommend them to anybody.
2,It seemed like it worked at first but after a week the ants were back with more growing.  Very frustrating.  Combat gel worked last year but could not find it this year.
3,"If you zoom in on the bottom left of the box there is a list of ants this product does not work on.<br />Too bad this info is not in the web description.<br />It may be fine for every other kind of ant, but I almost wasted my money."
5,This stuff is by far  and wide the best.. it actually works.. !!  And you don't need to toxify the house to get rid of the bugs.. the best..
5,"Lady Grey is practically the only tea my family and I drink. First we bought it because of cornflowers, which are kinda a symbol of Russia, where I was born, but we stayed with it for the taste. Try it cold with lemon - it's amazing!"
5,"This is a great product and was better then I expected.  I needed a large quantity and working through Amazon was great.  I was a little disappointed in the packaging, because the box was basically open due to poorly placed tape. But, being able to track the package was great!"
5,"I buy this tea for my wife. This is perhaps her favorite tea. Much like Earl Grey tea, but with a stronger floral taste. Of course, anything from Twinnings will always be of high quality. The price from Amazon is very good, so no reason not to buy and enjoy."
5,"Superb and absolutely delicious. Long a fan of Earl Grey tea and the many varieties associated with it, this delicious blend is now my all-time favorite!"
5,"This is an excellent tea unique to Twinings.  High quality tea leaves, pieces of citrus peel, and cornflower petals.  It has a delicate aroma, and is pleasant to drink in any mood and any weather.  I would highly recommend this tea."
5,I have such a hard time finding loose tea locally. Being able to order my favorite Lady Grey tea on Amazon is convenient and timesaving. The tea comes in a six-pack of tins that are just the right size to insure continued freshness. Speedy shipping too!
5,"Lady Grey is a unique and delicious tea. No other tea maker has been able to copy it's flavor. Very much worth a try, if you like a milder Earl Grey taste with citrus."
5,"I am so happy I found this tea on Amazon, I have been looking in stores for over a year.<br />It shipped immediately and I was so happy to have it in my kitchen again."
5,"Probably my favorite tea.  Lady Grey is similar to Earl Grey, the bergamot is subtler but it still has plenty of flavor.  I prefer loose tea over tea bags with strings. Lady Grey in the tin is VERY hard to find.  As I much as I love it, a 6 pack is a LOT of tea, I wish I could buy individual tins."
5,"I have bought this product twice on Amazon, it is a bargain for six tins of tea.  Lady Grey tea has a unique flavor, different from the regular Earl Grey tea that is more common.  I find it more robust, very tasty and wonderful with a little milk."
5,Shipment arrived on time and in good condition.  Most retail stores don't even carry Lady Grey.  All I have found is the sample packs with maybe 2 or 3 bags of this delicious mix of tea.  It was truly a great deal for the price. Highly recommended!!
5,"I just LOVE this tea. I am a very picky tea drinker and this is the only one that I currently drink. The loose tea tastes so much better than the old tea bags. I highly recommend it.<br />I drink my tea steamy hot with a little bit of milk, and that's what keeps me going in the morning."
5,"This is a great tea especially for Earl Grey lovers. The price is fantastic, I think you can't buy it in England for this price. Thanks"
5,This is the best tea!!!! Just perfect warm or iced - my all time favorite!!!  The fragrance is wonderful - the taste even better!!!
5,"Simply heaven, Earl Grey notes, orange and lemon peel with lovely blue flower!!!<br /><br />La vraie decadence!!!<br /><br />Enjoy!!!"
5,The price was excellent and the tea arrived quickly.  This is where I will be buying my tea in the future.
1,I love Twinings Lady Grey but the most recent batch was pretty bad. Regardless of how I brew it I get an odd odor that masks the characteristic Lady Grey aroma. I used some older tea under exactly the same conditions and got a perfect cup. I've got 6 tins of this stuff and it is a lost cause.
4,"THESE PEACHES ARE NOT AS TASTEY AS I HAD HOPED. LACKS MUCH FLAVOR BUT THEY ARE JUST OK. I LIKE THAT THERE'S NO SUGAR ADDED SO THEY ARE BETTER FOR ME, BUT THERE'S JUST NOT A LOT OF TASTE TO THEM. PROBABLY WON'T REORDER."
5,Our cat was having some problems with urinary tract infections.  This dry formula plus the Pro Plan canned formula for Urinary Tract Health seemed to get her completely cleared up.
5,I have a hard time drinking plain bottled water and these flavor packets are fantastic!  The flavor is not too overpowering which is nice - it's just a touch of tropical flavor.
5,Easy to use and Great taste. Shippment came on date quoted. I take extras to where ever I go instead of drinking plain water I just put a packet in the bottle and have a refreshing beverage. Can't beat it price wise.
5,"It's soooooo good, way better than Mixed Berry. It tastes really good, like fruit, I can't really describe it, just try it!"
5,"Great deal! Love this product. Trying to get away from diet soda and nutrasweet.  This is a healthy, refreshing option!"
4,"Sometimes you want a refreshing change to plain water, and this does the trick.  I could imagine adding a splash of gin or vodka on days you sort of want to be bad (smile)."
5,It is so nice to find something low calorie that isn't fake sweetener or full of HFCS. This also doesn't have dyes or artificial colors. Perfect for summer.
2,These are very colorful but not the best tasting. I used them for my sons first bday as we were having a very large party and didn't want to buy 20 mini cans but taste wise the quality was not there....the look was great. I'm sure no one knew any better after all frosting fixes all.
5,The Jimmies had purple in the mix.  That was exactly what I was looking for.  Since we are not planning on eating these (but throwing them instead of rice). I won't know taste.  But color is excellent!
5,"I used these rainbow jimmies for a rainbow cupcake topper and added them to rice krispie treats for my daughter's 6th birthday.  Obviously, it was a rainbow party.  The package didn't look like the picture, but I was not disappointed in the product.  I would buy from this company again."
5,"We chose a Thing 1/Thing 2 theme for our twins' first birthday party, and these sprinkles were the perfect color. They lean more towards turquoise than a true blue, but with our red baking cups, and white frosting, they were the perfect finishing touch!"
5,These sprinkles make a great presentation and are tasty too!  Used them for my french chocolate balls.  Would recommend them highly.
5,"Exactly what I thought it would be. ALOT (more then I will ever need) of pink sprinkles, that taste like... sprinkles!"
5,"Great size bag for the price! I am making a funfetti cake with just purple. These sprnkles/jimmies are exactly what I wanted. Although, the color could be darker."
5,Jimmies sprinkles are the best i love them because they are soft and unlike the other hard sprinkles don't get stuck in your teeth. lol But it was a great buy. You have a better deal here that anywhere else.
3,"Pros - good price for its size, fast delivery,<br />Con - not the best tasting jimmies, still better than getting the small grocery store size"
5,"This was perfect for my purposes! I made a personalized ""funfetti"" cake for a bridal shower for a girl whose colors were hot pink and black, and this was awesome to get it done! Fast shipping too!"
5,I bought these sprinkles for my cupcakes and not only are they gorgeous but you get a lot for the money. The silver is very true to color and they make a lovely accent to your cupcakes.
1,"At one time this was my favorite guilty pleasure. Sadly, there's nothing left to enjoy in these dry, flavorless packing peanuts."
5,"I love this! I don't use salt in my food and adding this to my salads and cooked dishes makes a BIG difference, PLUS you get the benefit of iodine supplement in the kelp. I love this product."
3,"I bought kelp to enrich my diet with iodine, hoping to substitute it for salt.<br />I find it crunchy, with an not altogether pleasing taste.  It's not on top of my list of recommendations."
5,I actually haven't received my package yet from Amazon but found a bottle in the organic market yesterday and used it on my chicken breast. I thought it was pretty good and I need a salt replacement. I'm trying to lose weight don't need salt adding on to my weight. I recommend it !
2,These are very colorful but not the best tasting. I used them for my sons first bday as we were having a very large party and didn't want to buy 20 mini cans but taste wise the quality was not there....the look was great. I'm sure no one knew any better after all frosting fixes all.

5,I love these cake mixes.  I am diabetic and these cakes are sugar free.  The cake is good and the frostings are great.  The pancake batter is also great. When I run I order again.  I love this cakes.
5,Love the Hershey's kisses! I bought them at a very good price ($19)with a $5 discount they cost me $14.  I may order them again when the price goes down.
4,Fast delivery and packaging was excellent.  The kisses are exactly as expected - excellent taste and plenty of almonds.  The kisses were made with milk chocolate and packaged in 10oz plastic bags.  I wish the kisses were available with with sugar free sweetener and almonds.
5,"This is the one you want to try as your first dessert wine, its like your first time having sex you want the best"
2,These are very colorful but not the best tasting. I used them for my sons first bday as we were having a very large party and didn't want to buy 20 mini cans but taste wise the quality was not there....the look was great. I'm sure no one knew any better after all frosting fixes all.

5,"This is the perfect finger food.  I usually eat a handful at a time.  Though to be honest, when asked how they taste, I say, ""It varies from person to person."""
5,"This rootbeer is amazing. I love this soda. My husband loves this soda. My son loves this soda. If you are looking for a chemical-free diet soda, look no further. Seriously. This is a good soda."
5,"I gave up artificial sweeteners a few years ago but still crave the occasional bubbly drink. I love this root beer. We moved to a smaller town about 6 months ago, and I was unable to find it locally. Amazon to the rescue! It is great having it delivered automatically."
3,"My wife bought these and was trying to find an alternative sweetener in a soda.  We are not going to buy them again... sorry.  Other's may like the soda, not us."
1,"Tart, bitter aftertaste, horrible diet rootbeer!  It makes me feel bad drinking this and I probably won't ever buy this brand name again."
5,"I love this version of Seafood Ramyun.  It's not too spicy like the other brand that Amazon also carries..It tastes really, really good...so good that I crave for it almost eveyday...nuff said."
5,"This is great ramyun. But if you take something like prilosec, this might not be for you."
5,"these noodles make me so happy!! comfort food! yum,yum!! they have real seafood bits and veggies! aaaand they're good and hot. not american hot, korean hot. i throw in some frozen shrimp and maybe a sausage patty and in seven minutes i'm eating a quality dinner. john"
5,I have ordered this product many times. I do wish could count for a non shipping fee item like it used to be instead of having it shipped from somewhere else.
2,"I use half a bag of seasoning but I still get thirsty afterwards, perhaps it has very high concentrate of MSG."
2,I found the taste a bit on the strong side and while it was definitely seafood flavored I could not distinguish what seafood. It is still passable though and the portions are large enough for 2.
5,This product is excellent. You don't taste the flower essences but it certainly works as i use it often during the work day and it helps me concentrate and stay focused.
5,"The nutritional benefits of extra virgin olive oil are legendary. But the robust flavor of Pompeian, the thickness, has hooked me onto this oil for many years."
5,"Great Olive oil, I bought a bottle in October of 2011 for $11.55 which I thought was an awesome deal, now it is $39.95.<br /><br />why the big price jump????"
4,I don't know why it didn't occur to me earlier to try to find my favorite Irish breakfast foods on Amazon.<br /><br />This is great!  You can get bangers too!<br /><br />I can make my favorite Ulster fry at home now!<br /><br />Thanks!
5,"It's Branston pickle, what is there to say. If you've never tried it you most likely wont like it. If you grew up in the UK its a staple on cheese of cold meat sandwiches. It's on my lunch sandwich today! :)"
4,"Was very glad to find Branston Pickle, as it is not easily available in the U.S.  (I got hooked on it years ago when living in London.)"
5,"I learned to love Branston Pickle when I was working for Laker Skytrain in England many years ago. I am American but have become very fond of English food and traditions. Now I have my source for the future, thank you."
4,"Product showed up in timely manner and in good condition (considering it's glass!). No surprises, which is always appreciated. Price was decent; sometimes one gets gouged for ""European imports"". We love this stuff and if we bought it in our home town, we'd have paid $4-5 dollars more."
4,"A strange taste, kind of like relish and jelly.  Not so good on toast but really good on ham and cheese melt."
5,"We were all out of our Branston Pickle...we really love this stuff with cheese in sandwiches,,,,quite British you know.  Great product and service.  Thanks lots!!"
5,"excellant very worth it and not disapointed, my wife is English and she misses this .. now we know where to get a good deal"
5,I ordered 2 bags of this item and paid $12.50 per bag.  When I received it I saw it came from Trader Joes. So the next time I needed some I went to our local Trader Joes and paid $3.99 per bag.  Unbelievable!!!
4,"I'm really enjoying these, and plan to reorder them when I run out. I didn't think they were too salty, but I mostly eat them in salads."
3,Firm olives but a little too salty for my taste.  I know these olives are supposed to be salty but they should not be a salt lick.  Good when eaten with other food.
4,These olives more than met my expectations. They arrived in a timely fashion and were very competitively priced.  I will buy them again.
2,"I order a lot of bars from Amazon, these were not a favorite.  Not bad, but there are better bars."
5,this is a great price and the delivery was super fast i first found these in yosemite at a much higher price & limeted QTY.
5,"These Mimicao cookies have a nice chocolate flavor and a light, crunchy texture.  They are a hit with my family and I especially like the fact that they don't contain that much sugar.  These have the same amount of sugar as graham crackers, but these are more fun."
3,"I like the product and the promptness of getting it. Shipping cost much to high,will not order from them again.ridiculous"
5,"I love this flour mix.  I have 3 kiddos, one is on a gluten free diet and one is on a gluten free/casein free diet.  This blend makes baking for them so easy.  I have used my everday receipes with this and things turn out great!  I love having this on hand."
5,"Coconut flour makes very yummy donuts!  I have also used it for making pancakes, and got very good results.  Will definitely be buying this product on a regular basis."
5,This flour has me baking on a regular basis again since we went gluten free.  There is NO grit!  My GF son is a hard-to-please eater and he said the yellow cake I made was the best he's ever had!  You can't go wrong with this!
2,"can't understand what the fuss is about. bakes better than 100% coconut flour, of course, but not worth the taste or health sacrifices."
2,"I completely missed the ""blend"" note, thinking it was coconut flour.  I'm sure many people are looking for the gluten free part, but if you're looking for lower carb, or non-grain flour (like a Primal diet), this won't work.  It has rice flour and potato starch in it - carb city!"
5,I ordered this icing for my daughter's first birthday cake.  I figured it would look good but taste terrible.  It actually tasted good! It looked great and was very easy to spread.  I was very pleasantly surprised.
5,"Bought this coffee in October, 2007.  Really liked its smooth coconut creme flavor.  Just right, not too weak, not too strong.  Amazon doesn't always seem to stock this and/or doesn't always have a great low price.  So I check back often."
5,"I have tried most of the Coffee Masters flavored coffees, and unlike another reviewer I've found this type to have the most flavor.  It smells and tastes like coconut, and quite plainly it's awesome."
2,I was very disappointed that this coffee did not have much coconut taste at all and now I'm stuck with 4 bags! I tastes ok as plain coffee but that's not what I wanted.<br />I think if you gave a cup to someone and didn't tell them it was flavored they would think it was plain coffee.
5,I have been a strictly Bigelow earl grey drinker for years and for some reason it has not tasted as good to me lately. I wanted a healthier tea and I really really like this tea. It takes very little of it to brew a cup/pot (and I would also suggest 'Tea Forte' products for brewing).
2,This tea has a smoky undertone to the flavor. All three cans had the same smoky flavor.  Other than that the tea was fine.
5,I love this tea - bold and smooth. I love the fact that you can use the tea leaves for more than one steep. It really makes it go a long way. I will be getting this again!
3,"The product is described as ""bold"" and that is accurate. We found that the high level of bergamot oil overwhelmed the flavor of the tea rather than enhancing it as other Earl Grey's we've tried. We are blending it with other teas to produce the milder bergamot we prefer."
5,"If you have friends who love Earl Grey tea, buy this as a gift for them.  They will thank you over and over.  It's the best Earl Grey I've ever had."
5,"Stumbled onto this tea by accident, but GLAD I did! I'm now on my 4th tin. Sometimes I add just a drop of honey and very thin slice of lemon, and my Saturday mornings are HAPPY, HAPPY, HAPPY!<br />This is my first Amazon review, but I like the tea so much, I wanted to share how awesome it is!"
3,This tea has an interesting scent in the can.  It's like bergamot overlaid with jasmine or some other unusual flower.  As a brewed tea it's all right but sniffing the dry tea was unpleasant.  I think we will stick with Republic of Tea or Yorkshire Gold.
5,"This is a wonderful, full-bodied tea. Until I found it on Amazon I purchased it at a local store for $11 per tin.<br /><br />I'm not a tea expert, or an Earl Grey expert. I just know what I like, and whether it's coffee or tea, I like it strong and full-bodied. This tea fits the bill."
5,Rishi is the finest quality tea you can imagine! This Earl Grey explodes with satisfying aroma and flavor! Don't say you don't like tea until you try Rishi!
5,"I have had various other Earl Grey tea's but for me, so far, I find Rishi is the best. Not too overpowering and lets face it Amazon has a great price on it. At the stores near my house I pay almost $10 per can."
5,"This tea is excellent, it has a delicious flavor, and it smells really good. I have to write twenty words.. so, I will just say, buy it with confidence, you won't regret."
5,i love this dark acidic tea. a little sugar or honey and it is the perfect thing to relax into. it also has a nice amount of caffiene so i use it to help me stay up at night for work.
4,"I found this tea to be excellent.  The only reason for the 4 stars, instead of 5, was that I had to resort to a shop vise and a wrench to get one of the 3 containers open. There is such a thing as too well sealed!"
5,In my estimation there is nothing better than Rishi teas. I have been a tea drinker for 60 years and have tried them all. The Rishi Earl Grey is unparalleled. I treat myself to a pound of it regularly!
5,"Rishi's tea is great! Nice flavor, color and most importantly it is not super-caffeinated like many other Earl Grey teas, so one can enjoy a 'strong' brew. Their white tea is also fantastic. I only wish they would make an English Breakfast version."
5,I was drinking Stash loose double bergamot earl grey and needed more... I tried this on a whim and I LOVE IT... There is tons of bergamot flavor.  This really is a very delicious tea and I won't be buying any more Stash.  This is all I need.
5,"Very nice Tea.<br />I enjoy an Earl Grey that has a strong aroma and taste of Bergamot oil (the citrus flavor added)<br />Others are good, but this one is great."
5,I love this organic fair trade tea and used to buy it at Whole Foods. When I found it on Amazon I was delighted! Now I can buy 3 at a time and it's like getting the third one free!
5,"Earl Grey tea is one of my favorite teas.  If it is important to you to have organic tea, seeing that it steeps in boiling water, then you cannot go wrong with this tea.  It has a rich fragrant smell as soon as you open the can.  No bags, so have a strainer or ball handy.  Recommended."
5,"Until you have tried this earl grey tea, you will not believe the difference.  The smell, the taste is so unique that it makes all other brands of earl grey I have tested seem completely ARTIFICIAL tasting.  Enjoy."
4,This tea is sooo good and you are drinking pure organic -  That is a good thing- I've tried other brands of loose tea and there is no comparison to the taste quality -  This is really good<br />All you need is a tea ball - and time to relax -<br />Try it - This Earl Grey is a keeper-
5,"This smooth black Earl Grey is a classic. Just the right amount of Bergamot oil. The brew isn't bitter, even if you over steep. Smooth and rich, but not heavy. I often reach for this tea on chilly mornings.<br /><br />Is this review helpful? Let me know, please vote. :-)"
5,"This is some really nice tea.  Even brewed slightly weak, the flavor comes through.  The scent will fill your whole house and just make everything seem a little bit better.  If you like Earl Grey, this is definately a brand to give a try."
5,Loose tea is the way to go and this brand is no exception. Lots of flavor and the packaging seals in the freshness very well. It's not cheap- but you get what you pay for. You will not be disappointed if you are a tea drinker and enjoy not being locked into using tea bags.
5,"This is not your typical ""loose leaf"" grocery market tea. It is whole leaf, pure, aromatic Earl Grey tea. It is very bold tasting, if you are not an Earl Grey fan, don't get it, but if you are, buy two. Excellent!"
5,Great organic Earl Grey tea. I used an automatic tea maker on the medium brew setting. The black tea had a nice smooth flavor with a gentle bergamot aftertaste. I highly recommend this loose tea.
5,"I adore Earl Grey tea.<br /><br />The tin looks great, protects the tea and is reusable for storage.<br />The loose tea allows me to brew a cup or a pot easily.<br />Works well and tastes great."
5,"If you can appreciate a good cup of tea, you will enjoy this one. Brew according to instructions to make sure you end up with a lovely cup of finest tea."
5,This is the best Earl Grey I've found. I've tried about 15 - 20 different brands. I like that it's also organic and fair trade.
5,"I would often have Fauchon and Hediard earl grey tea when I lived in Japan.<br />But here in the USA, they cannot be found anywhere. However, I'm really satisfied with this Rishi earl grey. It tastes as good as Fauchon and Hediard and the price is only half. It is highly recommended."
4,"This is a good coffee, and it is not too strong.  One thing I will point out, unless you like really weak coffee (I like it more medium) one capsule only makes about 4 ounces.  So for an 8 ounce cup I would use 2 capsules."
5,If you use the Dolce Gusto machine Amazon is the place to buy the coffee. You'll get the best price and super fast shipping. And if you setup a subscription for the coffee you'll even get a better price!
5,"This is the best coffee ever! I will never drink regular brewed again. I don't know how I lived without this coffee machine.Love It, Love it, Love it!"
4,"Definitely the best tasting, to me. I wasn't sure if it was the milk pods causing the aftertaste or not. I tried the coffee straight with my own milk or creamer, and it tasted better."
5,"As the product description says this is the perfect ""all day"" flavor for a wonderful tasting cup of coffee. It doesn't matter if you need it as your morning ""go juice"" or an evening coffee. You will be doing yourself a disservice if you don't give this one a shot."
5,I like this coffee because it's intense since i don't mix anything with my coffee i like good quality of coffee to enjoy purely it's aroma.. I like the fact that the machine makes a little foam and it raises it's texture a little bit to my favor. i simply love it!
3,"Its a nice system. If you like lattes or machiatto this can deliver them where the Nespresso can't.<br />The price here is way more than the Nescafe web site price though. These things are $9.49 a pack, how can anyone try to sell them for $40 for three?"
5,"This is my favorite flavor so far. I'm an espresso lover but not satisfied with the tiny amount, this lungo is just perfect for me."
5,"Rich, European coffee with an excellent flavor.  I highly recommend you try this flavor if you have a Dolce-Gusto Machine."
5,I have a Dolce Guso coffee maker and I LOVE it.  Unfortunately in our area the most we can buy are flavored coffees.  Thank you for handling the coffee's for my machine.  Our favorite is Lungo and Espresso.  We have several cups a day.
5,"Amazing coffee!  It gives you exactly what you need to get you moving in the morning.. a good jolt of caffeine.  Ever since I bought the Dolce Gusto Coffee machine, this is my coffee of choice, along with the Dolce Gusto Cappuccino.  Two thumbs up!"
5,love this coffee.  only 4 ounces per capsule.  always make two at a time!!!the best tasting.  never had anything but great coffee from dolce gusto!!!
5,"Convenient, great taste, aroma and crema.  A fantastic product for a quick coffee in the morning, or a more leisurely occasion with friends later in the day."
4,It is a mellow tasting coffee. I do not like strong coffee like Starbucks so if you do you may not like this coffee.
3,"My husband admittedly likes mild coffee.  He found this too strong and bitter, but said that some people like it that way.  He will try the mild version next, but said it also tasted like instant coffee.  He poured it out and made a pot of his favorite donut house blend."
5,"At 50 cents a cup, this is the best cup of coffee I've ever had. I'm addicted to this cup of mood enhancer and I love my dolce gusto!"
5,i love this tea for dieting its the best i will always purchase this tea for me and my family
4,"This is a good frosting, but very sweet. So I added a  touch of salt to cut the sweetness level and it was fine. Not as good as Betty Crocker's, though."
5,"Keep a can in the fridge. Open can, drain & cut up potatoes, add whatever you like in your potato salad, stir. Quick as a wink, you've got potato salad.<br />These potatoes are very good, non-mushy, no grey spots. Excellent value."
5,My shipment arrived with no dented cans and was delivered promptly.  These potatoes are tasty and of decent quality.  Great for quick recipes or as a side dish.  Very convenient to have on hand and price here is fair.
5,"Less expensive than the grocery store, and great quality.  Don't need to boil fresh potatoes, can use these right out of the can.  Very satisfied."
5,"Yes indeed do buyt hese, no dented cans,, and great price!..No grocery store can match this one,,Will always order these potatoes from here,,"
5,I live in Alaska and everything is exspensive here. This saved me alot money and I received them on time I will be ordering them again
5,"Fresh potatoes go bad on me, since i live alone, so these Libby's canned potatoes are perfect for me.  I fry them with my eggs, add them to my Chili, use them to make Au gratin potatoes or bake them with a bit of margarine in the microwave to have with my dinner."
1,"If you are going to eat potatoes, go organic and the real thing...not in a can. Big mistake. I like some canned foods but potatoes are a few miles away where you can get the real thing, cheap."
5,these canned potatoes are very good there a lot better then I thought they would be. I bought theses to use in stews and pot roasts or whatever else I'm making. it sure is better then pealing potatoes when I don't have the time will be buying these again.
3,I like them in stews.I need to work on frying them cut up;Any suggestions?I always wind up throwing fresh (used to be) potatoes out because I don't use them fast enough.Any tips?
1,"I just bought this item, 30-May-09, at my local supermarket for $4.29 per unit.  How can it list for over $14.00 and be discounted on your site for over $7.00?"
2,"Our dog seems to like them and he chews them up fast so I don't know how much they actually clean. Plus, sugar is listed as an ingredient! Are you serious?"
5,These are my little shi tzu dog's favourite treats. They also keep her teeth clean and breath fresh. But Walmart stopped carrying the small ones. I am so glad to find them on Amazon...and thrilled at the price. I bought 4 packages!
5,"I first found these at wal-mart and thought i would try them since my dogs love dingos rawhide so much. when given the choice between the rawhide and denta bones, they choose the dentas."
5,We have enjoyed several of the Baronet varieties -- very good Senseo coffee.<br /><br />The decaf is full flavored.
5,I am a coffee snob and I love a great cup of coffee.  Baronet passes the test with full-bodied flavor.  Great price as well!
4,"The product arrived when predicted. The coffee pods make coffee with a good flavor, but the aroma isn't as rich as with regular coffee."
5,"My husband has a Senseo coffee machine so we have used the Senseo pods which were okay. But Baronet is superb, especially for a decaf!"
1,"I bought from Amazon in Sept 09 for $26, now Apri 10, price is $36. Maybe time to buy jalapeno stock???<br /><br /><a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0012272JC"">La Victoria Hot Jalapeno Peppers Diced, 4-Ounce Units (Pack of 24)</a>"
5,I really enjoy this product. It is low calorie/fat/carb for sauces. I use it to flavor & thicken soups as well as use over pasta and vegis. I most often use extra virgin olive oil instead of butter with a little lowfat milk and it tastes great! I won't be without it! Highly recommended!
5,"I was looking for some great matcha that I can use for tea, lattes, etc. This is wonderful! I use my hand mixer to blend it in milk with some agave nectar and it makes a great latte! :o)"
5,I received this product in record time.  I tried it once and ordered again in bulk and am hooked.  Love the product and the company is excellent as far as packaging and the swift arrival time of my purchase. I would recommend to all my friends.
5,"I really like this matcha green tea. I've tried other organic brands of matcha green tea, but they don't mix well and clump. This also tastes great!"
5,This tea is very good Matcha Tea.  I also enjoyed matcha tea from Tea Trim which is more affordable also.  Either way you wont be dissapointed
2,"The sell by date for our pies is not until February of 2011- but maybe they are getting a little long in the tooth.  They taste a little stale to me.  The mincemeat is fine, but the crusts aren't good.  I'm a little disappointed.  At least they aren't rancid- but they definitely taste stale."
5,"This was a great ham & all my guest wanted to know where I purchased it.I now will get it for other occasions also, not just christmas."
5,I purchased this product for my sister in FL.  She loves cherries!  She said she had plenty to share with customers and friends and she enjoyed them as well.  They were shipped on time!
5,"Ola's coffee is low or acid free so I can enjoy without stomach problems, that's a fact but the reality is that this coffee is very good tasting and so smooth.  Never a burnt taste."
4,"I drink mostly German and Brazilian coffees for their smooth, strong flavor.  I received Ola's coffee as a gift and found it to be as pleasing as my favorites.  Ola's has no bitter/acidic taste and is strong enough to please this palate!  For an organic, free trade coffee this one is delicious!"
5,I ordered this because I LOVE bubble tea. I'll go crazy for it. The flavor is amazing and the bubbles were oook at times.
3,"My order did not include boba straws.  The shipper either forgot to put straws in my order, or this picture is misleading.  Otherwise, the tea was delicious, and the boba was easy to make and delicious!"
4,This nut spread is delicious and is not too sweet. It is especially good on sprouted raisin bread. Takes the place of peanut butter and is much healthier.
3,I do not like the consistancy or flavor of this product. Its price is near double that of sunflower butter which I also purchased to replace regular peanut butter. We love Sunbutter!
1,Very disappointing. It initially seemed like a good and healthier alternative to rawhide. I am extremely unhappy that this item is made in China!  I NEVER give my pets anything made in China.  There is much information out there about pets becoming ill and dying from products made in China.
5,"Our dog Callie loves these bones and she's VERY picky about flavours(only chicken). It's nice to give her something to ""chew"" on for awhile. They last a long time and are not smelly or greasy.  The price is reasonable and come in quantity options."
5,"I got these for my chihuahuas and all three of them love them! They seem to be easier to chew than rawhide, and I'm not as afraid of them choking! I wish they had more flavors- but I'm sure they will in time!"
5,this product is great my dogs are so sensitive to eating of rawhide but these are great no choking or getting sick
1,Bought a small SmartBones chicken dog chew for our mini dachshund this afternoon from the pet store and just discovered that this product is made in China!!  NO THANKS!
5,My bishon/shitzu puppy loves these. They don't last as long as a rawhide more like a treat. The mini size are perfect for her!
5,Love this product and so do dogs! It is a big hit with all breeds and owners alike. Try it out!
5,"SmartBones, Mini (Chicken flavor) is a great alternative to rawhide bones. I recommend this product for all dogs. My dog JJ loves this treat!"
5,The single most delicious thing on toast. Or made into a hot broth..... But you'd have to be English or an Aussie or south african I think to understand that. But all I can say is mmmm mmmm mmmmm
5,Dear America<br />Marmite is amazing stuff. You won't all like it though. You will either as they say LOVE IT or HATE IT.. It looks like tar and smells like beef. Try some on toast. with some butter.
5,"I enjoy the nice tang in this mayo, made coleslaw with it and it was much better than the usual brands."
1,In the description of the tea it lists all organic ingredients.  The tea I received only one of the ingredients is organic.<br />I will say that Amazon was awesome in responding and refunding.  But I do think this tea should not be listed as Organic.
4,"This is a great tasting oolong tea.  Light but rich in flavor!  I do have a concern though, the ingredients state 100% organic everything.  However, it does not state 100% organic on the tin, nor does the tin have the USDA organic stamp.  Can anyone verfiy this?"
5,This is one of the most delicious teas I have ever encountered.  It is like having dessert ... with a lot less calories!
4,"Other than making me smell stinky, this product works pretty well and helps increase my milk production when I need it."
5,"If you are looking to keep your milk production, this product will help you. I have been lactating my baby for three months and my milk supply has not stopped."
5,Great results and no funny after taste. This product really helped and worked quickly. I bought it because I was having a difficult time pumping enough to provide bottles for daycare. This definitely solved the problem.
3,This is an effective product for producing milk however my 2 month old wasnt getting full from my milk because it produces an abundance of foremilk which is watery and not enough hindmilk which is the creamy stuff. Also my son got diaper rash and was gassy.
4,I tried breast feeding my baby but was only getting few drops. But after using this my supple went up gradually and now after two months I am getting enough for my baby. I dont know what happens if I stop taking this but I dont want to find out.
5,"after so much difficulty with breastfeeding, i discovered these fenugreek pills that certainly helped with boosting my supply!  even though they are expensive I highly recommended them because they truly worked for me."
5,Fenugreek is a great supplement for all breastfeeding moms.  It has increased my milk supply extensively.  I recommend it for all moms.
5,"This is a wonderful frozen garlic naan.  My only complaints are that the directions call for too short a cooking time--try about 4 or 5 minutes instead, and the box is really big for the three slices of naan."
5,"arrived on time, and is a great tasting item, will order it again and again. convinient too!!!!!!"
1,I haven't purchased this product but wanted to post because it is misleading.<br /><br />Cream of tartar is the salt of tartaric acid.  Cream of tartar is used for baking.  If you are trying to make mascarpone cheese you need tartaric acid!
5,This was exactly what I was looking for/needing to make my own delicious smoothies.  It was shipped quickly and definitely met my expectations.  I will buy more when I run out!
5,"A high quality chocolate, packaged in a gorgeous long-stemmed box.  A nice gift to impress..... and they are wonderful chocolate besides."
5,This product is very good for stir fry and also is great for spaghetti!  There are none of the long list of preservatives that you see on other products.  You know what you are eatting - rice and water only.
5,My wife and I bought these online after struggling to find either the noodles in a store or finding fresh noodles.  We use them for one of our favorite recipes for Pad Thai.  We were pleasantly surprised how much better our recipe tasted using these fresh noodles.  Good luck to all chefs.
5,My husband is gluten-intolerant and we love these rice noodles as a substitute. They hold up well to boiling and we've used them for everything from spaghetti to fettucini to stir-fry. Even my kids love them.
5,I use these to make a stir fry orange chicken and they're fantastic every time.  They're ridiculously simple to prepare and taste great!
5,"Thai Kitchen Stir Fry Rice Noodles are extremely easy to prepare, and they taste wonderfully rich. I would even use them as a substitute for egg noodles. I have a lot of food allergies and had to find an alternative to wheat noodles. This is it!"
5,this is a great tasting product...thanks. Fast shipping and quality product. follow directions closely to get the desired doneness. I have ordered several times from this seller.
5,I stopped buying noodles from the local asian market thanks to amazon!<br /><br />i use these noodles for stir fry as well as soups such as pho. they cook easily and taste great! the price is very reasonable.<br /><br />thanks amazon!
5,This is one of my favorite gluten free rice noodles.  They work so much better than most GF noodles because they stay soft even when refrigerated.  They're perfect for making cold noodles dishes.  I love them!
1,"These noodles are not made in Thailand as the website, states, but in China! I advised Amazon of this, but they have yet to change the advertising, so buyer beware. If you prefer not to eat rice products from China, do not purchase these noodles."
2,was disappointed in the quality.  The product smelled stale and the taste was not up Sun Luck quality.
5,Wanted to let those in the States know that yesterday I found these at Cost Plus World Market. They have a new shipment of old/new candies. Old as in olden days that are re made for us generation x and y'rs.<br /><br />I am now officially hooked on pocket coffee!
5,Speedy delivery.  Would definitely do business with again.  Love the chocolate too.  The espresso inside is rich and it's a real espresso liquid unlike those creamy ones that dry out over time.  Good kick of caffeine with you chocolate craving.
5,"I discovered pocket coffees from a European college friend. These delicious little treats are quite a marvel, and are the perfect thing for chocolate and coffee lovers. I love them! All I wish is that I didn't have to buy them in bulk because I'm a slow candy eater, but it's all good!"
5,These 'Pocket Coffees' are just like we had in Italy!  We couldn't be happier with this product--Thank you so much for offering it!
5,"Great chocolate, the italian is better than the german one but still all good!!! I will buy it again any time. It is simply great. You have to try it. ;P"
5,Just as the title says:  'Heaven!!'  My friend shared the Pocket Coffee she bought in Italy this summer and I immediately checked Amazon for it.  Now it is here -- have shared but it is difficult
5,"This order was filled and shipped in a timely manner.  I was impressed with the packaging.  I tried to order these chocolates in the early fall, but it was impossible to get them before November no matter what store I searched.  It was worth the wait."
5,"These taste just as good as I thought they would. If I could get a better price , I would have them every day!"
5,"These are the most decadent, wonderful chocolates on the planet!! I covet them and share them scarely due to they are soo good everyone wants them...This was an awesome deal for a good supply. Highly Recommend."
5,The first time I tried Pocket Coffee was in Italy 4 years ago. It's still my favorite coffee candy! I highly recommmend it to anyone.
5,"I had these for the first time in Italy.  My wife and I actually give these to each other as gifts because, well, they are just THAT GOOD!  It sucks that they are seasonal, but it definitely makes me look forward to the holidays."
5,"Love these... I drink espresso every day, and when I need an extra shot at work this is great"
5,The pocket coffee I ordered is by far the best chocolate I have ever had and am now sharing it with my friends.
5,Zatarain's is my choice for gumbo seasoning. It has a great sassafras flavor. Not too strong and adds the right texture to your gumbo.  It works well with dirty rice or any recipe that calls for file.
2,"These bags are very small.  They are 67 cents each at the Wal-Mart.  I should have done my homework first, but needed these in a hurry for a party."
5,"Loved it! If you like cotton candy, this is a great buy. It's split up among different packages (so you don't have to eat it all at once) and it tasted great."
3,"Some of the packages were fine and the cotton candy was good.  In other packages, the cotton candy was a solid mass and was inedible.  There was no apparent damage to the packages with the bad cotton candy.  This was very disappointing."
3,"the blue and pink candy are all meshed together, but it is cotton candy. I used the packages in my kids lunch on friday's as a treat now."
4,"This cotton candy is good, but actually it was a little dry, when you first put it in your mouth its a little crispy? mine couldve been an older bag but it had pretty good flavor. If you want real cotton candy go to the fair!!;) But if you cant this is pretty dang close I guess."
5,My daughter loved this cotton candy. It was hard to find in the stores but am glad we found it online.
5,VERY GOOD ITEM BUT I FOUND IT WAS CHEAPER IN ANOTHER WEBSITE<br />NATIONWIDE CANDY.
1,"Avoderm has always been near the top of quality dog foods, but what a smell that came out of that bag of dog food...had to throw it away..do not buy until seller chimes in that they have a new batch"
4,"Coat your glass with the bitters, dump out the excess and add gin. Don't know of any other reason to buy this but I'm sure there are a few."
5,"I love these bitters, which have a taste all their own.  Good in drinks, good in soda water.  Refreshing mixed with other flavors or alone."
5,This is an excellent tea - subtle pear taste in an exquisite white tea blend
5,"The pear infusion doesn't knock you over the head. It's a subtle and soothing tea that is drinkable throughout my work day. Looking for something a bit different, go for this."
5,"I came to the site looking for the white tea / tangerine flavor, but settled for the white tea/pear - I wasn't dissappointed.  This tea has a light smooth taste that is perfect for that after dinner or evening tea drink with little to no caffeine to keep you up."
3,This is a pleasant enough White Tea but I don't taste Pear at all!  Which of course is disappointing considering I bought a flavored White Tea and not a plain one.  Won't buy again.  Prefer the CS Perfectly Pear instead.
5,"My cousin was delighted with this gift, was the best gift I could have bought, the only downside is that if you do not get the price, I had no option to remove the price."
5,I absolutely LOVE Wish Pearls.  They are an excellent gift for yourself or someone else.  So much fun to open the oyster and then wear the finished product.  Excellent choice!
4,"This is a great gift. It is a keepsake that you and the recipient get to create as you experience the moment of wishing, opening, and assembling the pearl and necklace. The quality of it was just fine, the pearl still in the closed shell."
4,This was a great gift for my nieces. They loved opening up the shell to find their treasure pearl.  I was told they are a unique gift and well appreciated.
4,"the kids enjoyed it. Very cute idea. The charm and chain could have been nicer , but great for the price."
1,"These are not odor free, in fact, they stink more than other bully sticks that we have had in the past.  I would not but again."
5,"I drank this tea while on trips to Russia and Ukraine.  I was so happy to find it for a reasonable price- in my previous searches, it was ridiculously expensive.  You get a LOT of tea in this container.  This is ceylon tea, and it is very, very good.  I highly recommend!"
5,these are the same spices thare used on the food network always fresh and great to use
5,"This is a product my dog loves. I was pleased to find it on the enter net<br />I have bought it from my pet store, but they no longer carry the product<br />I will buy again"
5,"The breeder of our puppy recommended these treats, since they are all fish and nothing else. Our puppy loves them, and they are small, which is practical and makes them last."
5,My cats go crazy for this treat. This is the only cat or dog treat they will eat. They all mob me in the kitchen every morning and evening. My dog loves it too and will try to get it from the cats if I don't catch him first.
5,"Awesome communication,  quick delivery, great responces  Hope to do business again.  Great to use for both food use  but also helps keep  away mice if you soak a cotton ball with it."
5,"I like l.o.c green tea best of all green teas I've tasted,its smooth,not bitter and has a very natural sweetness to it.does not have the earthy bitterness or dirt taste that so many others do."
5,My kid just loves this juice. Not sure why many store do not stock this regularly. Thanks to Amazon..we got this when we needed it.
5,these are real good.... they soften after a few moments and spread the taste all around your mouth.
1,"I've only bought one roll of these at the store. The first taste is OK, but there is a really weird aftertaste that I can only describe as tasting ""moldy""? Bought the wintergreen version as well and they definitely do NOT have the odd aftertaste."
5,"I used to love Altoids cinnimon mints. But I bought these in Whole Foods once<br />and the flavor was REAL. Not fake. These are the real deal. Great flavor, lovely<br />meltaway texture. I am hooked."
5,"Very cinamonny, refreshing, virtuous ingredients.  A real pleasure.  Will buy again and keep in the house.  Love them."
1,I've purchased a number of Newman's Own products for me and my dogs. This is the first time that I've been completely disappointed. Don't bother with these mints - there is very little cinammon flavor and there is a flavor that tastes something like dirt.
5,Received promply.  Nice quality for price.  Sturdier and more details than the ones that came with the race track.  My son loves them.
5,These were delicious.  Just like buying them from the store.  Would buy them again.  used them for a birthday party and they were a hit even with the adults.
1,"Expired and broke my daughters braces,<br />She should not have been eating it in the first place lol but they were as stale as a rock!!"
5,"This sauce has a thick texture, has an amazing fire roasted flavor, it is gluten free and we love it."
4,"I eat these nuts daily, right after I eat some fruit. They are wonderful, however it would have been wonderful had they been roasted."
5,"This tea is the best tea ever! Fruity and caffeine free. I am hooked!  Great with scones, cookies or cake."
5,"If you have not eaten this product you are missing a great treat.  Add a chopped chicken breast, serve on tortilla with hot sauce and cheese...marbelous meal with salad."
5,"Love it- with the directions and seasoning, I suggest adding an extra can of black beans to stretch the meal."
4,"I've been feeding my two labradors this food for about 3 yrs now and they are both doing well.<br />My older lab (13yrs.) seems to thrive on it and despite some level of arthritis in her hips, she still is very active. I don't mean to ascribe this to Canidae soley, but it certainly helps."
4,"I like this dog's food for my dog, it's high quality and not too expensive.  I have to say though that the bag came all ragged and opened."
5,"My two little little dogs can only eat grain-free kibbles.  Their stomachs are very sensitive.  Besides the fact they really like eating the food, it is a healthy choice for them.  It is difficult finding grain-free dry dog food that my dogs will eat."
5,good quality product. cheaper and easier to get from amazon than local pet store. switched from merrick because dogs had terrible gas. this has a great ingredient list.
5,switched from solid gold to merrick wilderness when solid gold was sold.  dogs had terrible gas on merrick (most likely from the unnecessary fruits).  switched to canidae and all is well.  ordered from amazon.  free shipping.  was about $25 cheaper than getting it from my local store.
5,"Not bad, good deal on a big bag of food, especially for this kind of dog food, too bad the salmon one costs alot more"
1,its difficult to rate dog food.  i guess you look at the ingredients and if your dog eats it then its good.<br />well the ingredients were great but my dog didnt like it and its pretty pricey.  thats all i can say.
1,"This used to be a great food, but they've changed the formula and my dogs have suffered.  Their customer service is very rude.  My dogs showed signs of distress within the first 24 hours of eating the new formula.  Explosive Diaherra, Vomiting, Fur became dull.  Change it back Canidae!!!"
4,This is one of the best dog foods on the market.  It saved me quite a bit of money to order it directly through Amazon rather than try to find it locally.
5,"This has proven to be an excellent food for our 10-year-old bulldog.  She no longer has tear stains, and her coat is luxurious.  She actually eats less, because this food is so nourishing.  Heartily recommended!"
5,I had read a lot about the health benefits of using Canidae for my dogs.  I think I have seen evidence of healthier skin in my dog with skin issues.
5,Our 2 Vizslas have done very well with this food since we switched from Foster Smith food last year.
5,This dog food is the food that the breeder uses for all her dogs both adult and puppies.  We continued to feed our puppy Canidae when we got him and he is turning into a fine dog.<br /><br />Rod
5,My dogs just love this food. The service is always fast and reliable.
5,This food has made new dogs out of our two small dogs.  Their energy levels and the quality of their coats both show a marked improvement within the first two weeks.  After one year of use we notice a marked increase in general health and activity.
5,"My dogs just love the food and they look great! Their coats are shiny, no more scratching or itching. I also love the free shipping and price! Don't be afraid to give this a try, your dogs will thank you!!"
5,"This is a great product. It is very healthy for all of our dogs, and it is the first food that they all love to eat. It helped my older dog lose weight and my 10 year old lab gain the weight he needed to be healthy."
4,"I read lots of reviews on the internet on dry dog food, this one was highly rated for grain free.  it may be expensive but well worth the price. My standard poodle is very picky about his food, not a food hound in the least, he liked it immediately."
5,"We have some of the smallest chihuahuas and a larger outdoor dog, and both sizes can eat it easily.  The dogs like it, and they seem to know when it arrives.  The only problem I have is that it takes about a week to get here, and I need to remember to order early."
5,"I have used this food for 3 months, and at first I thought it was great. But have since taken all my dogs off of it. Their coats are dry and have bad hair loss. Some dogs it is hard to keep weight on them with this food."
4,My dogs enjoy this food and seem lively and excited to eat it. Very happy also that it's not made by Menu Foods - peace of mind factor is high. Great product!
5,I was happy to see that I could order this product online and have it shipped to my home.  It is difficult to find in stores.
5,Excellent product great for mexican beer and shooters of<br />tequila. Great on chicken and fish also.<br />My order arrived quickly in good shape.
5,"If you Love a little zip in your food or drinks this is the way to go! It has a wonderful blend of Lemon & Lime and the added kick of salt makes it perfect for plain popcorn, or vegetable juices etc.."
5,I love this stuff! I blend up ice and throw some of this salt on it and squeeze some lime juice on and I'm set! I moved to San Diego from Oklahoma and couldn't find this product anywhere so I bought some from her and couldn't be happier!
5,This Stuff is great! I order it for me and my buddies all the time!!! Whole lot cheaper than buying it at grocery stores!!!!
5,Twang lemon-lime salt is very good on fruit such as apples and also tomatoes.  I love to eat it that way.  This is the only way I use it.
5,"I am hooked on this stuff!!! Great on beer, spaghetti, beer, salad, beer, soups, beer, sandwiches and beer. Well you get my drift! I tried to make it on my own but just can't get that ""Twang""."
1,"Product was never received nor money returned.  Four requests have been ignored.  I will probably never again order anything through Twang or from Amazon.  Also, I will spread the word about these sites."
1,My 10 month old took one bite made a face and refused the rest. She eats anything. I tried it and so did my husband. It tasted like potting soil and has a very bitter after taste. I feel like some of the veggies are not cooked long enough and thats why its bitter.
1,"We love happybaby products, our twins like most of them.  Unfortantely this is nothing like the others.  Very dry, paste like.  Babies refused to eat it."
3,The ingredients are just great that's why I ordered it but when I opened the pouch and tasted... I know it's very healthy but this meal is not eatable.  I have ended up adding few spoons to meals I cook or just other baby food but this is it.
5,"Love this product!  Our daughter couldn't have soy or dairy so we really struggled to find food she could eat, not to mention organic food that fit that profile.  Loved this product, highly recommended!"
4,"My daughter loved this because it was chunkier than the Earth's Best stage 3 foods.  The only thing is that while Earth's Best is cheaper through Amazon Mom, this is actually cheaper through Fresh Direct, so we get our through them."
5,"This is great!  It smells great!  I love all of the vegetables in it.  Texture is not chunky and is eaten very well by my triplets, even the one with just 4 teeth."
5,This food is great!  My triplets love it.  I thought it tasted great too!  If I need to go on puree food I want this.
5,"My son loves chick chick. This is the only baby food he will still eat. It is a little messy to open sometimes, but not a big deal."
5,"We tried this for the first time while on vacation this month(risky, I know...) and to our surprise our happy baby(13 mths) loved it! No problems, smelled delicious and gobbled it all up!  Definate must try! Signed up for regularly delivery!"
5,"The Happy Baby Chick Chick is delicious and my baby loves it.  It's a hearty puree, not so runny.  It's got little pea sized pieces of chicken and pasta in it which she loves to gum on.  It smells good and tastes good.  I like that it's organic and wholesome."
3,"My daughter did not like this flavor, she will eat it with a little bit of vegetable or fruit puree every other bite.  It is a bit of a struggle, and honestly it is a strong fishy smell coming out of the package.  This is also a chunkier and drier pouch compared to the other flavors."
4,"My daughter likes these foods, but is not as keen on this flavor.  I think it is the the texture, this flavor is a little drier and more crumbly than the other flavors.  However, if I am not worried about the mess it almost makes a decent finger food for her."
5,"I got this food for my little one in all the flavors.  I have to say the chicken is her favorite.  The pouch is great for traveling, and is a good portion size.  The consistency is a little chunky, just right for mine with 4 teeth.  One pouch and some finger foods is perfect for her."
1,I'm sure this Mama Grain is pretty healthy but it taste disgusting. Even my daughter who is not a picky eater refuse to eat this. The combination of sweet banana and beans doesn't go well at all.
1,I was so hoping she would like this because it is so healthy and would be easy to take camping and out to dinner...but she wouldn't eat any of it and kept spitting it out. I gave it to the dogs and they loved it and I am sure it is healthy for them!
1,This is seriously the ONLY food we have purchased that my baby rejected EVER.  She has eaten everything we've given her.  Poor thing gagged and gagged every spoon I tried...
2,"I really wish my toddler liked this. It seems to be very high quality and it would provide more variety in his diet. Every so often he'll eat it, but it usually needs to be mixed with something else.  I think it tastes fine, but it wasn't a hit. I bought a case so I keep trying."
1,"I (and my little guy) have loved almost all other happy baby products, but this was revolting.  On the up side, my dog loves it . . ."
2,I wanted this for the omega 3's but my daughter wouldn't eat this.  It really smells and looks like cat food.
2,"This is a really good product but not a great price.  Shop-rite's normal price is the same as the subscribe and save price.  They however have it on special offer so it is cheaper still, yet you don't have to buy 16 at once."
5,This baby food is both convenient and healthy. it's great to not worry about what my son is eating and be able to grab this when I'm in a pinch!
5,my super picky baby loves this. it taste good.packaging are so convenient too. when she wont eat anything else i always resort to this.
5,"This is great baby food.  It has an interesting texture that our baby likes in her mouth, and she loves the taste.  I love that she gets protein that is more than puree, but not so thick she can choke."
1,"My baby and I both loved the stage 1 Happy Baby pouches that we tried, so I had high hopes for this as well. To my dismay, it smelled like cat food and was gritty. I expected there to be more morsels of food,  but this was just mush. My son took a few bites and refused to eat any more."
5,"My baby like this very much.I think the salmon is delicious,the salmon is good food,it can make my baby happy."
4,"Okay, it does smell kind of like cat food. But it is packaged fish, which I think is what cat food is, so I guess that's not a huge surprise. My daughter really likes it, and I like that it's good for her, so overall we give this our seal of approval."
1,"I don't see how there can be good quality salmon in this or lentils.....it is mostly potato and pollack (substitute cheap fish) --- this is really terrible for organic baby food - ugh, if i only had a cat to feed it to...."
5,"These pouches are the next best to homemade.  When I don't have time to steam and blend my own baby food, I always reach for happy baby!"
1,I ordered this one and the salmon but I got two salmon instead. I bet this one would be good if I ever got it.
1,"Please do not send the salmon as baby will no eat it, please send the chicken on Happybaby Organic Baby Food. I am to received this once a month.<br /><br />Marlene layman"
2,"My son wouldn't eat it either! I tasted it... I would not eat it, also. Tasteless, unappetizing in texture and  flavor.<br />It says ""minimal processing""... does that mean it is not even cooked? No wonder our babies and toddlers hate it!!! I would NEVER knowingly feed my child or myself RAW meat."
5,"I have 12 month olds and no time to write a great review, but they like all the flavors, the textures are great, and the pouches open easily. They don't reseal, but that's fine because there are never leftovers."
5,"My little one loves this line of food, and I love how convenient they are!  We traveled to Europe for two weeks and packed a ton of these for the trip.  They survived several planes, buses, and boats.  Easy, convenient, and healthy... what's not to love?"
1,"My son used to love the Chick Chick, Gobble Gobble, and Super Salmon. But they changed the recipe, and now it's more corn than anything else. Taste is bad too. Nutrition value is lower. He doesn't like it, and neither do I. I am totally pissed."
4,My 18+ month old enjoys this food very much. The texture is fine for him and he finished a whole packet.
5,Babys loves this one and so do I.  Love the packaging to- no jars to wash.
5,"My baby boy loves eating this food, better than some Earth's best Stage 3 foods.  It doesn't taste too bad either.  I love the sweet potatoes in the food.  The pouch is great for on the go, not having to worry about glass food containers breaking in the diaper bag, especially when we go for hikes."
2,This looks and smells great but my son didn't really like it.  the texture is much lumpier than their other products.  It requires a lot of chewing and seems a bit dry.
5,I bought this for my grandson.  I used it for the in between stage from strained food to small finger food. He really liked this. He loves sweet potatoes so this was great!
3,"It smells delicious but unfortunately my 11 month old was having problems with the Amaranth.  He does eat some finger foods - mango, peaches, carrots, etc... but for some reason he was having problems with the Amaranth - maybe it was too grainy for him.  Will try it down the road again."
5,"Finally a baby food that tastes fresh!  Love that it's a great protein plus good veggies.  Great for anyone looking for a way to feed your baby ""good stuff."""
5,These pouches are so easy and convenient. They taste great and are perfect for busy moms.
5,"I have 12 month olds and no time to write a great review, but they like all the flavors, the textures are great, and the pouches open easily. They don't reseal, but that's fine because there are never leftovers."
1,"Not sure why they decided to mess with a good thing. We've cancelled our subscriptions to both the Chick Chick and Salmon HappyBaby pouches. A huge disappointment to our family as these were two go to meals in our household for our 14 month old. Please bring back the old formula, HappyBaby!"
5,"this baby food is the greatest.  My granddaughter loves it and even calls it by name. she is 15 months old and still enjoys it, and I have peace of mind because I know I am feeding her a good balanced meal at a great price"
5,My daughter loves this food. This is her favorite of all the HappyBaby Organic Baby Food. I make all of her fruits and vegetables but decided not to continue this with the meats. She did great transitioning from the food I make at home to this packaged product so it must taste pretty fresh.
5,This is a perfect portion and very simple to use when going out. I love the convenience of this product!
5,These pouches are so easy and convenient. They taste great and are perfect for busy moms.
1,"This new recipe is horrible! It is watery, almost like a stage 1 meal, and it went from 4g of protein to 1g.  Most of the veggie pouches have more protein!  Definitely not worth the purchase."
5,"Love this product! Our daughter couldn't have soy or dairy so we really struggled to find food she could eat, not to mention organic food that fit that profile. Loved this product, highly recommended!"
5,"My baby LOVES his chicken, and he prefers it in this type of food pouch. It is easy to heat up and nice that it came in a timely manner"
5,"My baby loves this stuff. It is a great texture and actually reasonably tasty. I like that he gets some protein, and that the flavor combination isn't as boring as some."
5,"My son isn't a particularly picky eater but occasionally he gets fussy.  No matter what his mood is, this is a great meal option to fall back on because he'll always eat it.  Also the pouch sturdy and makes it a good travel-meal option.  A little expensive but worth every penny!"
5,This is very smooth and easy to feed to my triplets.  They love it.  I like that is has great vegetables in it also.
2,"My 10-month old hates this! Even when I mix it with the Earth's Best veggies that he loves, he will spit it out. Tried the salmon and the Ratatouille and he hates all of it. Bought three cases of the stuff!!! Now what to do? Will keep on trying it."
5,This stuff has a strong taste and I was surprised my son liked it but he would munch it down hungrily every time.
5,I really like this organic brand and also their minimal packaging. Our almost 12 month olds really seem to enjoy the taste and the consistency is just right.
5,My twin boys both love this food.  It has the best texture of any of the HAPPYBABY meats we've tried.  The pieces of chicken and pasta aren't too big either.  This is great for babies resistant to texture--It has some but not too much!
5,My 10 month old can not get enough of this food.  We take this when we go out to eat and always have to take 2 packs because she loves it so much!!  Can't wait to try the other flavors.
5,The salmon is my daughter's favorite Happy Baby flavor.  I like feeding it to her because it adds fish to her diet and I want to keep tuna to a minimum.
5,My 12 month old loves this salmon.  These containers are great for traveling and make easy meals!
5,"My 14 month old loves this stuff--it's a little chunkier than some of their other products, but it's a great introduction to solids!"
2,"I can't get my 10 month old to eat any ""dinner"" type baby food.  I thought this would be different, but it's not.  Baby doesn't like it, so it's no good to me.  Not sure what I am going to do with the other 15 packs."
5,These pouches were very easy to take with us and the baby just LOVED it! No leftovers here. I really like that they come in two protein varieties - chicken and a turkey! Great options and easy to take with you!!
5,These pouches are so easy and convenient.  They taste great and are perfect for busy moms.
5,I have tried this flavor first time when my son was 6 months and he loved it right away. Did not have problem with texture either. This one and Chick Chick are his favorite right now.
5,"it took about a month for my 11m to start liking this salmon pouch.  the price is great, about a $1/pouch.  its very easy to take with you when traveling since no heating or mixing required. just open and put a spoon in it.  i will probable keep giving this to her past her 1st b-day."
1,Very surprised.  Expected it to be thicker.  My 8 month olds are not pickey eaters but they refused to close thier mouths while this food was is there.  I would try it from babies r us before buying in bulk here.
5,"I have 12 month olds and no time to write a great review, but they like all the flavors, the textures are great, and the pouches open easily. They don't reseal, but that's fine because there are never leftovers."
5,these are great. my baby loves them. it is one of his favorite foods and he's a picky little guy. they actually taste good and buying in bulk makes them way cheaper!
1,"My son loves all of the Happy Baby meals he's tried except for this one. He literally gagged. I think it was the use of peppers in the recipe, as he's not been exposed to peppers yet. He is clearly not a fan so be careful if your child hasn't tried peppers yet...they may not like this one."
4,"This was much chunkier than I expected.  Our baby still can't handle lumpy food, so he wouldn't eat it at first.  But after I pureed it smooth, he loved it."
5,"This is all my son will eat, besides oatmeal. The texture works for him, because he's always choking if things are too chunky. This has a mushy with texture consistency that he swallows just fine. I'm going to try other Happy baby products now.."
5,"My son loves these!  I carry them in my purse and they are great for travel, shopping, and for stopping teething tears in the grocery store!!!  Thank you Belle!!  Awesome product."
5,"This is my favorite of the Zatarain's boxed meals lineup. It's easy to prepare and delicious. In the past six months I haven't been able to find it locally, which broke my stomach's heart (why don't you carry this anymore, United?). Thank goodness for Amazon.<br /><br />This stuff is awesome."
5,Great coffee brewed very quickly.  Two brew settings allows for one cup as well as one mug.  Hot water for tea or other hot beverages.
5,I bought is item and now I am concerned about the increasing cost of k-cups.  So I find the solofill on Amazon.com.  Great item.  Now I use my own coffee and it is .20 per cup.
3,"coffee maker is okay, but does not make a full cup of coffee, even when you select the larger cup. Kind of dissapointing."
2,"Even when the machine appears to work, you end up with tiny cups of coffee and have to take 2 or maybe 3 attempts at getting coffee out of it. At a minimum though, the water is always hot enough and it makes a fine cup of hot water for tea."
5,Now this is the way everyone should drink coffee. I am so please with this product. Coffee even taste better.
5,"This is a great Keurig. It's the same as the B40 Elite brewer; this model is called the B44. It comes with a cupon for 12 free K Cups. After having it for a month now, I have no complaints."
5,I bought this for my mother for Christmas.  What a wonderful product.  We set it up and both had a fresh cup of coffee in under a minute....thinking now of buying one for myself.
5,"This brewer is ideal for my spouse.  She likes designer coffees and I am not fond of them.  She can make a cup of whatever she desires each morning, and make cup of tea at night.  Meanwhile, I can enjoy my old fashioned brewed pot of coffee."
1,"I bought this machine 1 1/2 years ago, have trouble with it filling the cup and thought, OK, I might try it again, but after reading a number of reviews and the machine is still having the same problem, I will not purchase another Kurig."
1,"I love it when it worked for the first 6 months.  Woke up one morning, dead!  Never to be used again, too much to spend for 6 months of use.  Useless, do not recommend."
2,"Our company gave these as gives at a corprate party in February 2011.  There were 20 handed out to Exec. Staff.  By Christmas, every one had died.<br /><br />I LOVED having coffee ready at my elbow whenever I wanted it, but it isn't worth the money for 8 months of convenience."
3,"We bought the one cup thinking it was the perfect thing to brew coffee for my in-laws and herbal tea and apple cider for the rest of us.  But after brewing a few cups of coffee, it makes everything taste like coffee.  Mechanically it is working fine after two months."
5,I love this product the coffee and teas a great but they need to work on a hot chocolate it taste to water down
5,"this is my 4th keurig sine 10/06, really like this product ,i use the my kcup all the time with my own brand<br /> of coffee,easy and wonderful.great product.<br />amazon had the beat price on the internet,and with no shipping a no brainer"
5,This is the best thing I have ever purchased .. Works amazing and you don't have to make a whole cup of coffee and waste it.
5,"My Daughter raved about her Brewer and told me I should get one. Boy, am I glad I did. I never new coffee making could be that easy.  And the flavors are like an adventure."
5,"I loved my Keurig so much that I bought this one for my mother for her birthday, easter, mothers day, 4th of July, etc.  She loves it just as well and uses it every day.  The best product EVER!<br />Be sure and register your machine you get 2 free boxes of k-cups!"
5,"Have only had this product for a month, but so far am very happy with it.  It appears to be very durable and is fast.  I wish it had a setting for a larger cup but it is fast enough to brew one of their mug settings followed by one cup setting."
4,"just does what we expect a keurig to do. Short of having more sizes to select from in the way of your cup and what it brews, i like it. I've used other keurig machines and i like this just as much as the rest"
5,"We purchase 2 of these coffee makers. They were gifts to our Mom and Dad. They work great,no problem. The prices was great."
4,"We enjoy having the convenience of one cup at a time coffee. I wanted a one cup decafe option for evening, as well as the occasional hot tea or cocoa treat. Our Keurig has been the perfect answer."
5,"This coffee maker is great and it is so fast.  It is easy to use and easy to clean and even has adjustments for the size cup you are using.  Delivery was fast. Even in the Christmas rush, I ordered one day and had it the next.  Would recommend to anyone!"
5,I received my Keurig really fast after ordering it and it came in in excellent condition.  Absolutely the best purchase I have made in a while!
5,"This is our favorite rice sticks brand. We were getting very tired of competing with people to get this at a local grocery store, often sold-out. Now we're very glad that Amazon.com carries it with much better price (and free shipping)."
5,This is the exact noodles used for a main-staple Filipino dish (Pancit) I fix for my family every Christmas.  It's getting harder and harder to find these noodles in my local grocery.  I'm so glad I can find it on-line.  Thank you Amazon.com for making it capable for me to find.
5,We use these noodles to make our own meifun/meifung stir-fry.  They're extremely easy to cook (only requires they sit in boiling temperature water for 10 minutes). Love this product!
5,I love this product. I add the softened noodles to stir fry. They can also be a quick side dish.
5,"There were several different flavors of truffles in the box and they were all great. If you like chocolate truffles, you are going to love this box of candy."
5,"I grew up eating this wonderful candy, in my book there is no better. A bit pricey but well worth it. When I eat Sees Truffles my tummy giggles :-) Thanks Amazon for making this product available. You are my one stop shop these days. Fantastic candy fast delivery"
5,"If you're looking for bargain basement chocolates this isn't for you.  But if you want to try a taste you'll never forget and probably buy more, as I did, you can't go wrong.  This is simply the best I've ever had, bar none.  It's expensive, so's an Acura, but both are worth it."
5,"See's, in my opinion, makes absolutely the best chocolate in the United States. I sure wish they would make it eligible for Amazon Prime. I'd get a subscription for 2lbs a month lol."
5,"My daughter moved to a new home in Washington state from San Diego, California. The grandkids loved the housewarming gift."
5,See's candy is delicious. There were shops in California where I grew up.  Now I live in New England and there is no other way to get it except mail order. I'll take it! ;)
1,See's makes delicious chocolates; close to the best; but their chipping charges make each purchase a total rip off. I think that every one should boycott See's for that reason.
5,We have tried a couple of different horehound drops and these are by far the best. They are like the kind we used to have when we were kids. They are good for sore or dry throats or just good for something to have. Thanks for making them available to us again.
5,These cough drops are great. My grandparents have used them most of thier life but could they help me too? Yes My throat was better quick. The taste is acquired and I have not yet. I will though because they work better than halls and ricola and all the others.
5,"I love these things, cant stop eating them. Not much else to write regarding a piece of candy. I shared a couple bags with family members and they love them too. Excellent flavor."
5,Tried different brand from local candy store. It was awful!  This has good strong horehound flavor without being bitter.  Will order again when my supply dwindles.
5,"I love horehound drops and Claey's are the BEST. Plus, they were well priced and they sent them very quickly. I highly recommend them."
5,"Fast, smooth transacation.  Great value.  Hard to find cany but of course Amazon had it!!  Purchase a case for husband & he's just about thru it in 2 months!!  So it must be GOOD!  would buy again"
1,I just threw out $25 worth of this and other flavors I bought from another company online. I bought because of the good reviews right here. I remember horehound being stout and an acquired taste. This brand barely has any flavour at all. If you want real horehound look elsewhere.
3,I got these from the store the other day and the taste is nasty. They are good for sore throats though.
5,I use this porcini salt in many savory dishes - cooked entrees and salads. Delicious. You don't have to use a lot for it to make a big difference. Just a small sprinkle will do the job. It seems expensive for such a little jar but the impact from just a small sprinkle is worth the cost.
5,"Excellent Boldo tea. I have had Boldo tea many times in South America., and always wanted to get in the States. It was very difficult to obtain. This one surpasses what I had before, in flavor and body."
5,If you like root beer this candy is the best ever!!  The service and price were excellent.  I highly recommend both.
1,"I was excited to try this because I love vanilla lattes. It is the drink I order most often, and make at home on a regular basis. This tastes so fake, similar to the instant vanilla coffee drinks. It does not taste like a vanilla latte that you can get at a coffeehouse."
5,This Company sent the most beautiful Pink long stem roses I had ever seen to my Mom for this Mother's Day! They arrived eary and in superb condition! Roses were fresh and Mom was impressed. I will definately order from them again!!!!
5,Roses arrived very quickly and in fine shape. They are still on our dining room table. I would highly recommend these fine flowers.
5,My cat had some major vomiting issues.  This food solved it instantly.  She seems to like it and seems to be in good health.
3,Couldn't find in the description where this was pate.  My cat generally will not eat pate but one can down so we will see.  It would be nice if this was included in the description. - 1/24/2012
4,I usually buy avoderm but this food is an excellent way for me to stretch out the case. I feed the kids this and they eat it all.... No leftovers!
5,My cats are very picky but they love this food. It is very dense and provides a large amount of good quality food for my two cats. I especially like the fact that there are garden greens inside the food. It is good for their digestion.
5,THEY ARE DELICIOUS NOT SALTY YOU CAN SIT AND EAT 2-3 2 OUNCE BAGS AT A TIME I GIVE THESE 5 STARS PLUS I HAVE TO STOP MYSELF FROM EATING THEM THEY ARE DELICIOUS.
5,"These chips are the best!! I've tried some of the other flavors and they are ok, nothing special... but the Mesquite BBQ is hands down the best BBQ chips I've ever had! if you like BBQ chips (and are not concerned with the calories most chips bring), then you will not be disappointed in these!"
5,These are delicious lower sodium/fat chips. Convenient lunch/snack size bag is enough for sharing. Halloween is two months away and the kids will be getting these for trick or treating at our house.  By the case means they're always on hand.
5,"The chips are deliciously spicy and super crispy.  It takes a second for the heat to hit but<br />when it does, it's AWESOME!  Love these chips and will continue to buy for a long time."
5,Deep river snacks are the best chips ever!!! I'm addicted to the zesty jalapeno and haven't tried other flavors. I recommend this brand to everyone.
5,These are everything I want in a potato chip; Flavor that jumps out at you and they stay crunchy!!<br />Do yourself a favor(and flavor) and try these chips!!
5,"Whole family loved 'em. Hard enough to break your teeth (in a good way, they are kettle chips after all).  24 for $17? We'll definitely buy again."
4,"These are very good chips. The Asian Sweet & Spicy--not too sweet, not too spicy, or salty--perfectly balanced seasoning. We received very fresh packages.  I just like thicker cut potato chips especially being kettle cooked, but that will not deter me from ordering again."
5,I really like these chips and so do my customers. Tangy and spicy chips with a sweet finish.  I look for 2 oz. bags like these.
5,My husband was just diagnosed as gluten intolerant and he thought his life was over.  Surprize he loved these chips and couldn't believe it.  I did too and am not allergic to foods.  Can't say enough good things about this chip.
5,I find deep river snacks everywhere but hardly ever find the cracked pepper and sea salt.  Glad that Amazon carries it.  If you like spicy and peppery these are the chips for you.
5,"I was very skeptical about buying a brand of chips I had never tasted before, much less buying it in bulk.<br />However, I had not regretted it.<br />These chips are one of the best I had tried and certainly exceeded my expectations.<br />They're reasonably priced too so that is a big plus!"
5,"This is a heavy kettle style chip that is not as ""heavy"" as kettle brand chips, but bas good flavor.  I will reorder."
5,I recently bought these chips.  Came home and only three bags were left in the box.  My whole family loves them.  They have great flavor and better and healthier than more chips. I'm ordering a few more boxes today
4,"These are not the ""same old"" chips by far and the Asian Sweet & Spicy sparked my imagination too, makes you appreciate the new and improved variety of potatoe chips. This flavor is easily an ""8"" on the ten-scale."
5,"I love Rosemary chips, but can't find any at my location. I was glad I came across these, at such a great price."
5,The potato chips are wonderfully tasty.  My sons and I both like the Rosemary and Olive Oil because it is not as spicy.  We also got the Jalapeno.  It is not so much I don't like the Jalapeno.  It is spicy hot for me.  I still love the potato chips.
5,Being what you would call a chip connoisseur was looking forward to trying these.  Great chips.
5,Very nice chips; just the right size to serve with a sandwich and watch my calories.
